0,p9em0y,1,0,From The Lights to The Darkness There was a man named John who was the Minister of Defense and he had six children and his wife was pregnant with the seventh and the time of her birth came and on the day she gave birth to the seventh her baby died while she was giving birth to him  so she broke down and she was depressed and severely sad for many months One day  she saw people adopting a child in the orphanage  so she ran to his wife and called him Elizabeth  John  I want to adopt a child from the orphanage  and I want you to come right away John  Really   Isnt the death of our baby enough for you and dont forget that we have  children and we can take care of them Elizabeth  But I want to make an orphan happy and fulfill the promise of his mother and father  and I want them to rest these poor orphans John  Its okay  Ill come to you He reached the orphanage and saw the child who wanted him  and his skin color was tan  so he was disgusted with him  John said   You only searched for this  why do you want this child   Elizabeth  I saw him and loved him  and you have nothing to do with me This child was  months old and was raised by Elizabeth and grew up to be  years old and this childs name was Raiden John decided to go camping with his family He was playing with his children the game of searching for treasure and they were all excited and happy and Raiden was watching them from afar and he was living for a moment and imagining that he was the hero who would get the treasure Suddenly he went to his brothers He said  I want to play with you and get the treasure One of his brothers  whose name is Kevin  said  If you want to play with us  you have to be the thief and we are the pirates and their destination is the thief  the liar traitor and not one of them   Raiden agreed and went looking for him or they threw stones at him and beat him with sticks and they ran away and then it rained and he was crying and in pain in the rain and after three hours his mother came out of the hut to look for him and found him wet and unconscious and she was screaming and took him to the nearest hospital The doctors treated him and he was fine  but every day he remembers that incident and dreams about it and every day he gets scared and screams and remembers the shapes of his brothers as if they were monsters that look like shadows  In a chair between the darkness with his head on the ground and thinking about the monsters around him  they were whispering to him Rayden was a hard working boy  the smartest in the whole school  and the teachers called him the Great Plan of America because he loved planning and strategies  and he was the first in his school from the age of  to   but between all the years he had no friends and he was always a shy person and did not like to talk He did not speak or utter a word to anyone  and between the years he was bullied by his brothers and friends at school So he was in high school at the age of   and he started the new year in high school  days and weeks passed  and he was in the same condition  And he was always watching her and seeing her  and everything he tried to talk to her was afraid and nervous and ran away so as not to embarrass himself  One day  a school party came and he wanted to invite her to the party  but he was nervous  but this time he was encouraged and decided to talk to her  so he went to her Raiden said   I want to invite you to the school party  and I hope youll agree   Jennifer said  Um  I really dont know  but I have no doubts  Raidens brother came and spoiled everything and said   Oh  brother  I found you  I want to talk to you about an important topic  Oh Jennifer  hello  just a minute  I want my brother on a topic   Jennifer  Its okay  take your time with him Kevin Raiden took him and his friends to the basement of the school  mocked him  tied the ropes  and locked him in the basement laughing  He untied it by chance and went looking for things and things in the basement  until he found a hammer and went to the door And he broke the door with the hammer  but he got out and ran and fled to the forests and heavy rain crying and hearing voices of whispering and laughter and heavy and terrifying sounds  And he woke up in the hospital and his mother was crying  and his father saw him from afar and smiled a malicious smile and said to his mother  Raiden  Where am I and what happened  His mother Elizabeth says  We called the police and they searched for you and found you in the woods fainting And he went home full of grudges  hatred and negative feelings And everything overwhelms him with depression  but the boy who was sitting in the dark and whispers comes to him and only wants to kill has woken up  to be continued       And this is my first story i know their alot of Spelling errors so yea,4897,950

2,p95gy5,1,0,no change for  …  so this happen today…i had just clocked in  counted my register and made sure i put the sign that says exact change   not accepting  … and  min later some lady comes wanting to pay for her   stuff in  … i told her i don’t have change for that i just clocked in and she said “what am i suppose to do then i need my detergent” so i told her she can wait a few minutes or come back while costumers give me   bills… she waited but the costumers behind her all paid in card WHICH SHE SAW  she said “can i pay now” already being rude and impatient  i replied i still don’t have change they paid in card… she goes “what am i suppose to do then” i said idk what you want me to tell you i just clocked in and don’t have change…  she’s like “that’s not my problem i don’t work here there suppose to leave you change as a company” the store i work for is so small here they are mainly in the east coast not west and then asked for my manager which told her the same thing and then called us ugly and poor manager skills   she said she’ll call corporate which i don’t care that’s how my shift went today lol,1137,228
3,p8yldr,1,25,The Serial Drink Spiller This just happened to me today  I work in a general store  I had like  minutes left on my shift  when a kid comes by and tells me that someone spilled a bottle of soda on the floor  I assumed that if he was the culprit  it was an accident  and I wasnt going to press the issue  If it wasnt him  customers suck  so that also checks out  As Im wiping it up with paper towels  he starts telling how there was also a spill in another one of our stores  I naively tell him  I think thats just a coincidence  Theres not some serial drink spiller going around   Thats when he started saying  This must happen all the time  which basically confirmed in my head that this kid spilled the soda but didnt want to admit it   Whatever   I thought   Im just going to clean this up  then my shift is done   My boss sees me cleaning up this giant puddle of soda with paper towels and tells me to just go get the mop  I go to the back  fill up the mop bucket  and then head up to the front to grab some wet floor signs  where my boss is telling this kids dad that he was told that  someone  had spilled a whole bottle of baby shampoo on the floor in a different aisle  and that he  saw  the kid pouring a different soda directly onto the floor  I had to stay an extra  minutes to clean up the extra spills he made  Fun fact  when you mop up baby shampoo  it creates so many suds and soapy foam that you have to change the mop water  because the mop water quickly becomes   foam,1507,296
4,p8qc84,1,32,This seems relevant for the time of year  Kind of specific  but this time of year really brings back some memories from my first job  I worked in a school uniform store every summer for about  years  Wasnt like working in your usual clothing store  we catered for about two dozen local schools and we had to be familiar with every item of the uniform for every one of those schools Customers didnt just come in and pick out what they wanted like in a normal clothing store  They would come in  tell us what they needed for which school and we would measure up  then go out back and bring the correct size items to try on  I dont know if this is a thing in other countries but here  when a kid starts school or moves from primary to secondary school  coming in to get their new uniform is quite a big moment  Quite often entire families would come in and theyd all fuss over the kid like they were trying on a wedding dress or something  It was quite sweet but it did put a certain amount of pressure on us to not ruin the moment  You see  the company would keep records of the most popular sizes from previous sales and theyd order more of those sizes and fewer of the really tiny or really big sizes  they also knew how many pupils were in the schools so they would base the amount of stock ordered on those numbers  And quite often the company would have a deal with the school so that theyd be the sole provider for that uniform  In other words  we only had so much  and you couldnt get it anywhere else   not saying it was the best system  but thats how it was  Every year between May and September  things would go kind of nuts  We loved the parents who would bring their kids in early  when we had full stock and plenty of time to order anything we didnt have  But   every year  without fail  there would be the parents who would leave it until a week before their kid was due to start school and come in expecting the full works  Our absolute favourites were the ones who had children who were tiny little things  or somewhat taller larger than average  So nowadays  whenever the last week or two of August rolls around  my mind goes back to being screamed at by angry parents and feeling horribly sorry for the embarrassed little kids who werent going to have uniforms on their first day at a new school   or were going to have to go in wearing a uniform  sizes too big for them  I had parents refuse to leave  I had one very angry father rip the phone out of the front desk and launch it at me  I think about the queues out of the front doors  I say a little good luck to whomever happens to be working there right now  To any parents who are ever in need of a uniform for their kid   here is my advice  dont leave it until now  because they  will not  have everything you need  and most likely will not be able to get it for you in time  no matter how much they want to  And it isnt their fault  its yours  Take your kid in May  the shop will be empty  youll get their full attention  youll get everything you need and I promise you  the staff will love you for it,3111,590
5,p8luvh,1,11,Football tackle When I was  I was a supervisor at a grocery store and we had a lot of incidents of people trying to steal things but heres one of my favourites One of the common tricks people played trying to steal things was filling up their own reusable bags and hiding it somewhere at the front end of the store so its easy for them to grab and run  Most of the lanes had chains that went across to prevent this situation but the end lane closest to the door didnt as it was a  security lane   not really sure what they expected a bunch of   year old girls to do but it is what it is    The thing about the security lane is someone ALWAYS was supposed to be on it  Im not really sure what happened but the girl I had stationed there wasnt on her lane and this guy saw his chance and took it  In comes my two favourite managers  well call them Gerry  late s  and Ken  Mid s   running after this guy at full speed  I was on a till since I was covering a break so the customer I was serving and I watch out the window as Gerry full on football tackles this man in the parking lot taking him down like  feet away from the door Thinking about it now the guy probably could have pressed charges against Gerry for assaulting him but the guy had like   worth of meat so it would probably have been more trouble than it was worth They ended up dragging this crying man into the store and making him wait for the cops to get there  it was definitely the highlight of my working experience,1512,293
6,p8lnmm,1,36,No  I dont need to hit Skip  Ill put this in my review   So I work at a pretty well known department store  does the word bullseye ring a bell   and Im ringing up guests  Its near the end of a full shift  Im exhausted but still doing my best with customer service  when an old man comes into my line  After ringing him up  I ask if hes a member of our rewards program as per protocol  He says he is  but he doesnt want to type in his phone number since it wont help him for this particular purchase  There goes   cash back but Im not about to argue  so I ask him to please hit Skip on the pad  He fumbles with his card and very matter of factly tells me he doesnt need to hit Skip and that itll skip automatically  Well  lets put him on payroll since he knows our system so well  I go ahead and hit the button for him  explaining that our system changed recently and it wont allow me to proceed with the transaction unless its given an answer about the rewards program  For some reason  this annoys him  He hems and haws and asks if all of our stores are doing this  since he was just at So And So location and they didnt make him do it   I cant speak for other stores  I only work at this one   Hey  its the truth  does he really think a cashier has the time or motivation to check the policies of other stores   Thinking back on it now this definitely went into effect at other locations since it happened a month ago when I went across the country to visit my dad   But that really ticked him off  and he informed me that wed be hearing about this in his review  Okay  bye  Seriously  what the hell did he expect me to do about it  Reprogram the system right then and there,1701,327
7,p8kk8w,1,41,Back to school and the lines are    unobservant  So  its that dreaded time of year  almost as insane as Black Friday  the time known as Back To School  The lines are long and staffing is short  The majority were scheduled for the early rush  I  on the other hand  had the fun of handling the early evening crowd  Imagine  Im on a register  there are only half the registers open  and the lines are LONG  Even self check has  people waiting  I think I have at least five in my line  but I really cant tell  Calling for more cashiers does nothing  we simply dont have any  And then I look behind me  It was a confusing and  at this point in the evening  somewhat surreal sight  There was a long line at the register behind mine  The gentleman who was first in line was about to put his things on the conveyor belt  And yet    Sir  that register isnt open  This was met with a blank stare  I pointed upward   The light is off and theres no one there  That register is closed   And with that  the whole line backed out slowly and sadly  TLDR  on our busiest night  I had to tell a crowd of people that they were lined up at an empty  closed register,1159,218

10,p7mg1k,1,0,No cream cheese filled pretzel for you  A post appeared on my Facebook feed from a woman complaining about a local convenience store She was up in arms because she called the store wanting to know if the store had cream cheese filled pretzels  The clerk responded that she had customers and she didnt have time to look  This lady went on and on about how lazy and entitled the clerk was  Every single response called her out on  her  entitlement  pointing out that clerks work alone for the late shift   Man  did she get flamed The post was removed shortly thereafter It was good to see so many people sticking up for the clerk,637,112
11,p7d1uz,1,128,You Only Closed One Minute Ago  Why Not Serve Me  A great story from a week or so ago with a customer coming into my work looking to get a new mobile phone  Key thing to understand is that our state is in lockdown so the door to the shop is always locked as per the agreement to allow us to still operate in some form  On this door we have about  different signs all stating that we cannot allow customers in store  we have a contact number they need to call to place orders and our operating times which end at pm  You cannot miss these signs  We also work with the main lights turned off Anyway  we have worked all day and I have completed all the end of day stuff that comes with retail  Closed the til  locked stock away  we all do some heavy cleaning now with COVID and everyone is just sitting around having a chat while the main manager gathers his things to lock up As Im working off a laptop I see a guy come to the door   its pm on the dot at this point  He looks inside  sees people and starts trying to wave someone over to the door  I dont move as I think surely he will see the sign and realise we are not only closed but dont allow customers to come into our store at this time  Surely enough this man continues to stand at the door  Now most people will look inside the shop then read the signs  and we see them take out their phones and either dial the number there or input it into their devices for a call later Realising this guy isnt leaving I head over to the door and the following happens Me  Hey mate  were closed  There are some contact numbers on the signs for the   sales team if you want to hit them up Customer  I need a new phone Me  Alright  as I said we are closed  Try the   sales team Customer  What time did you close Me  pm today  I know its earlier than usual but with lockdown thats the go  mate Customer  Its only   Now at this point I was floored  He showed me his current phone and stated that it was only   like this was supposed to be a great reveal and convince us to do his order  I informed him that   is in fact still after pm and we would be going home any minute  After he swore a little but he asked what else he could do  I told him I was going home but he could try that   number I suggested when he first arrived,2320,450
12,p77wo8,1,71,No  you cant leave the store without paying  The title is the slightest bit clickbaity  but its the best way to describe the situation  We have a problem at our store with people not going all the way through with their payment before they leave So theyll go to pay with card  but then on the last step they simply wont do it or will not confirm the amount  Therefore  the purchase doesnt go through  Policy is that until the amount is confirmed and your receipt is printed  whether you plan on taking the receipt or not  you CAN NOT leave the store  You have to stay there until the receipt prints  Even if the system is being fucky  even if I have to put more paper in my receipt printer  blah blah blah  No receipt  no walk away Thats where todays experience comes in  A lady  her partner  and their tween daughter walk into the store  Guy is a very nice and pleasant fellow and  after helping his lady put all the items on the counter  goes out to wait in the car I ring up the stuff  put them in a few bags and spin the thingy around for when theyre ready to grab them  Lady inserts her card  daughter grabs the bags  In the middle of the purchase  card in machine putting in her pin or whatever  the lady says  Go ahead   daughter   you can go ahead out to the car  Bells go off in my head  Ive had people walk out without confirming payment before   Happened on my first week  made me feel terrible but it all got sorted   So I turn to the girl and say  No you actually cant leave yet  hold on please   And her mom says  Yes she can  Luckily my boss was there and she explained as nicely as she could that the daughter cant leave until the receipt prints  and the lady gets all huffy  Receipt prints  girl goes out the door  I hand lady the receipt and she SNATCHES it from my hand  I tell her to have a nice day and she sarcastically says  Yeah whatever  you too  Forgive me if Im wrong but its common sense to not leave with merchandise until you have paid for it  Stay mad I guess ¯   ツ   ¯,2026,379
13,p77wm5,1,5,Collect your own damn carts This took place close to  years ago when I was a Junior in High School and living in Florida   At the time I was working evenings at a big name Grocery store that was right next to a chain drugstore   Most evenings  one of my responsibilities was to gather shopping carts from the parking lot and bring them inside the store so they wouldnt be stolen   I would generally gather the drugstores carts for them as a courtesy and put them on the sidewalk near their front door   In the year and a half that I worked there the drugstore never  and I mean NEVER  gathered their carts from the parking lot   That is  until one evening when there were more drugstore carts in the lot than my stores carts   So  I took it upon myself to ensure that the drugstore would  from then on  gather their own carts from the parking lot About a week later one of my fellow closers commented on how they hadnt seen any of the drugstore carts in the lot lately   So I said   Yeah  its amazing how persuasive I can be without saying a single word    Puzzled expression from co worker   So I explained what I did to achieve cart gathering compliance from the drugstore   The night their carts outnumbered ours I took one of their carts and and basically folded it into itself and jumped up and down on it until it was no more than a   thick layer of bent  mangled metal and then I placed it right in front of their main entrance   After that we never had to deal with any of the drugstores carts being left in the parking lot,1544,298
14,p72zkv,1,7,Order  What order   Ah glorious retail  My story takes place a few days ago  mods recommended taking time to calm down before posting  so thankyou  A cstomer came to the till asking for a refund for an online order  which she later stated that it was a repeat order and was unable to cancel herself  Online orders need to be refunded onto a card or gift card  Me is me  customer is c  Me  Pop your card in when youre ready  C  I cant  my banks been suspended Me  Awh no worries  Ill have to put it on a giftcard  C  Nope  Me  um  well I have to put it on one or the other as its an online order C  well lasy time this happened  managers here made some calls and did it on cash  Is that a new policy   Me  sorry  no  online orders need    C   interrupting me  before you carry on with that speil  they did it for me last time  Manager   was listening and hovering  unfortunately who ever did that  did it incorrectly  Online orders have to go back on card or giftcard  C  fine  walks off to the person theyre with  put it on that one I looked at my manager and they nodded  Me  Sure   Transaction goes through  C  so just to recap  you couldnt do the refund to cash  but could do it to someone elses card   Me  well  yeah because its an online    C  i dont care about that speil They walk off and im just stood there with my manager  confused and a bit shaken  I went out the back to calm myself  as I could feel a panic attack coming  I popped to the office and watched the cameras on the till to see if they come back around and pick them up     As something about the whole incident didnt feel right  After a few minutes and no activity I decided to go grab them anyway  and bring them to the warehouse  Remembering that the customer was unable to cancel the order  and that being part of their frustration  I called up customer service   cause thats what were supposed to do  try to resolve issues for customers  While on hold  I happened to notice that the dates on the parcels were for delivery  months previous  Odd  The manager quietly asked what I was up to  and I said about cancelling them Manager  good idea  Good initiative Finally got through to a rep  and enquired about the order  using the details on the parcels  Turns out they did indeed have a repeat but for some reason it didnt get shipped a few months previously    I mentioned the date of these parcels  which they found equally interesting and a little suspect  We cancelled the order  regardless  Amazing  Manager  you alright  Me  yeah  Its all cancelled  and relayed what the rep said  Manager  I agree  little suspect  I bet the customer will moan now that its cancelled  We laugh it off and I go about facing up  tidying stock etc  Huh    Theyre still in the store   there begins my internal battle of do I just keep quiet or do I let them know   to cover my own butt  so I can say that the customer was aware that its been cancelled if any issue arises   Naturally  I chose the wrong option  The conversation that follows is not exact as Ive now somewhat surpressed it  And remember    They previously told me that they  couldnt cancel the order online or by phone     Me  hey  just thought Id let you know that Ive been able to contact customer service to cancel your order  C   looks blankly  what order  Me      Um  the repeat order  C  what order  Me  the    One    We refunded  C  but i cancelled that months ago    Me  err    Well its fully cancelled now    C  so you used my details to do that Me  uh      C  i dont know why you did something that wasnt asked of you  Me  but    C  this conversation is over  Me  alright  Points to manager for foreseeing that  I was dumbfounded  What an odd reaction for something that was actually really helpful  And now thinking about it  most legit people wouldnt have blown up like they did   I absolutely know I did the correct thing  Conflict always reduces me to an anxious wreckage hah  So once again I retreated out the back  and spoke to the manager and a phew other colleagues that were there  All were confused and taken aback by such a reaction  Honestly  I cannot wait to be out of retail,4254,772
15,p72zb0,1,19,A regular doesnt remember anything I manage a vape shop and one of our regulars is a woman who has underwent multiple brain surgeries  The surgeries have left her with severe memory issues to the point where she basically cant communicate anything to you  even the simplest things  Usually her mom shops for her or they come in together  but sometimes she comes in alone and its extremely difficult to figure out what shes asking for because shell just describe it as a  thing  or give a description that doesnt really make sense  I feel really bad for her  shes so sweet and understanding when we cant understand what she wants  Her visit today really broke my heart tho  Our POS system has a feature where if you put your card into the reader  we can pull up a list of all the things youve ever purchased here with that card She was trying to describe that she needed batteries to me  but she couldnt think of the word and was saying things like  its not for the alcohol  or  its what makes it open  so I was having a very hard time figuring it out  I asked if she usually buys it when she comes  because if so she could insert her card and I could see it on the list since shes such a frequent customer  Her response was  no  Ive never been here before   I honestly wasnt sure whether I should remind her that shes a regular or if I should pretend I was mistaken  I didnt want to embarrass her or freak her out so I pretended I was mistaken We see her every couple weeks and have been for the past year or so  Thankfully her mother ended up calling her to see how she was making out and she reminded her that shes after batteries,1661,309
16,p71aef,1,0,Did you ever leave retail and then go back  This isnt a story or experience really   months ago I quit working retail and I work in manufacturing now  I work  hour shifts nearly every day  overtime is mandatory every week  Im just starting to feel very tired of the work and sometimes compare it to my old retail jobs  I feel crazy for thinking of going back to retail  I didnt hate all of my past retail jobs  some were better than others  But I make so much more money in manufacturing and no customers to deal with  But I work st shift and honestly I kind of hate working st shift  I used to work rd and I liked it more  There is no nd or rd shift at my current job  So has anyone else left retail and later decided to go back to it,749,149
17,p6xu8q,1,6,Really  sir   Not everyone in an apron knows how to use the registers   This was from last night I am a head cashier at a large box retailer   that has a policy about not wanting the HC running a registers because they cannot do that and run the floor   I still am willing to help out the best I can when the need arises Last night  we only had enough cashiers to keep SCO running   which actually are pretty nice because they only use a wireless scan gun  great for big carts of large items   like lumber I dont recall all the details  but I came up to the SCO area to notice the cashier was busy with another customer and there was one waiting with the prompt on the screen asking for intervention I scan myself in and help him out rather quickly and return the lane to SCO mode  then stand and watch the front for a moment   It wasnt busy  but one of our regulars was standing next to me when the cashier comes up to the guy I just help and we both hear this Cashier  Everything going ok Customer  No  but I already got helped   even though I stood here watching people walk past that refused to help me The regular turns to me and goes   Is it a full moon or something  people need to chill the f down   I come in theres a fight over there  and other over there  and now this guy   who doesnt understand that you all work in different departments  so not everyone walking by in an apron can sign into a register My only reply to him was this  They see me walk up out of nowhere and do it  so suddenly they expect anyone in the store to be able to   even if they are NOT trained to use the registers  and therefore do NOT have the bar code that scans them into them   You are right though  were all separate departments   If more people understood that  I wouldnt have people calling me over like a puppy to ask a question I cannot answer The regular started laughing   kind sir  you are a saint,1923,372

19,p6i6kv,1,39,But the shop is closed   I work as a cashier in a supermarket  This particular day we were closing at nine oclock  I was finished work at nine oclock  I had a queue of customers up until that time  As soon as I knew which customer was going to be my last that day  I got the attention of the next woman in the queue  Im sorry  my till is closing  To which she replied   But the shop is closed  I wasnt really sure what her point was  I forgot that maybe she didnt know some of our cashiers are rostered to work half an hour after closing time for just this exact eventuality  So I repeated myself  Im sorry  but  my  till is closing   But the shop is closed  I was really confused at this point and said  Im sorry  but Im finished work at nine   The shop closes at nine  At this point the urge to say  Well maybe you should have done your shopping earlier then   was almost irresistible so I just didnt say anything  She went to another till  where the cashier was working until half past  and bitched about me the whole way through the transaction  Worst customer service shed ever received  apparently,1128,201
20,p6a6fl,1,306,Maam  this is an express lane  Take your   order elsewhere  For some background  this happened yesterday  Im a teenage cashier working at a regional  privately owned grocery store  and this is about my th week working here  Im still kind of learning the ropes  but mostly everything is down pat So  yesterday  I got to work for a   hour shift  Not that bad  And hey  my supervisors tell me I get to be on an Express lane  hooray  The one that Im on is specifically  items or less  and that express lane sign is turned on with a separate switch from the one that turns on the sign for the number of my register  So  for the first half of my shift  Im doing just fine  Then  I get to go on a  minute break  When I get back  I sign back in to my till  put back on my light  but when my next customer comes  she has a cart with what looks like  ish items  I ask her   Hey there  is that  items or less   She looks pretty bewildered  and says   Oh  I didnt think that this was     Then  I see that my express light isnt on  Whoops  my mistake  I tell her as such  apologize and ring her up anyways  Right after I turn my express light back on  however  my next customer and her daughter come into line behind customer   and have a full cart with what must have been   worth of groceries  I ask her if she has  items or less  and she clearly doesnt  but she doesnt respond  After I finish with customer   the customer with the large order comes up  starts putting stuff on the belt  and as much as I try to explain things to her  she doesnt seem to want to listen  I know she knows the language  however  as her and her daughter are chatting it up constantly  So  here I am  cashier in the express lane  ringing up a   order for a customer who seemingly doesnt care  and who is holding up  customers who actually deserve the line behind her  When I finally finish her transaction  I tell her her total  and she pulls out a CHECKBOOK  We NEVER get checks anymore  Total waste of our customers time  Leaves without saying a word to me  I try to apologize vehemently to the customers she held up  and luckily they understood  Still  I guess this is what retail is like,2198,418
21,p5tyhf,1,12,Gotta have those hangers  To preface this  this wasn’t my personal experience  but this happened to a coworker today and it was too good not to share  We work at a popular retail chain and this is from his perspective I’m on the register and this family walks in  a father  mother  uncle  and daughter  I ring up the father for some socks and jewelry   no issues there  but its when the daughter comes up that we have a problem  The daughter was around  years old and she asked if she could keep the hanger attached to her shirt and shorts  I said  “sorry I cant do that because we keep our hangers ” To which the father replied “no no it’s okay  we always keep the hangers ” And of courseI’ve never seen these people in my life soI just keep saying “no I cant do that ”It goes on like this for about  minutes of the father and uncle saying “yes you can” or “we’ll take the hangers”  or “thank you it’s no problem ” Basically just insisting that I’ve already done something for them  Eventually they turn this into a “call your manager we’re taking these hangers ” And I try saying “no I’m not calling a manager ” this is a stupid request  Of course I didn’t actually say this is stupid  but I did say it’s not something to be argued over I sensed that  it’s gonna turn into another back and forth so I called the managerthey explained the same thing to hersaying that I was rude and refused them service of hangers    And they pulled everyone’s favorite line  “the customer is always right ” After some more banter with my manager   who’d already decided to give them the hangers as they weren’t gonna stop until they got their way  they said I should smile more  As an entertainer I did take off my mask and give them a sinister smileI was semi cosplaying  for anyone wondering  just some formal clothing that’s green and gold with a crown as a headband  They took it as endearing and went about their merry day I really didn’t mind that they took the hangers  but what kind of request is that from a store that clearly keeps their hangers,2060,377
22,p5rhx1,1,62,If you can’t hear me  take off the headphones  And PLEASE put on some PANTS  Some things to note before I begin my short story I’m a cashier at my local privately owned grocery store  During this whole pandemic thing  our store has taken steps to be as safe as possible and protect our customers as much as we can  this includes our carts being sanitized every time someone new uses them Our cart sanitation is this whole process I won’t go into  but it does involve customers lining up  and waiting for a cart to be sanitized for them before they can enter the store  This whole part is run by one employee at a time On this particular day  the guy scheduled to run cart sanitation couldn’t do half his shift due to medical reasons  So I was sent out to take over as I have been trained on it  and have a face shield assigned to me Now for my story  Being in a small town  you get to know most of your regular shoppers  both the good and the bad  But there is this one guy who comes in every other Sunday  he is the topic here This guy has many defining features about him  specifically the hard hat  construction vest  noise cancelling headphones  and he has this pink dog chew toy strapped to the front of his vest  I’ve seen his unfavourable behaviour both inside the store in the isles and checkout  and outside the store on cart sanitation On this particular Sunday  he pulls up to the store on his bicycle  recognized instantly because of the pink pool noodle tied in a knot on the back  he hops off and struts towards the doors  I wipe a cart and stick it in front of the door  He has no mask on  a usual occurrence  but today he also DID NOT HAVE PANTS ONI  or anyone else on sanitation  usually don’t stop him for his lack of mask and immediately call a manager on our mobile store phone  because we know it will do absolutely nothing if we try and intervene ourselves  But today I had to stop him before I even called the manager Our conversation went as follows Me  “sir  hey  Hey sir  Stop ” I wave my arm infront of himGuy  “WHAT WHAT DO YOU WANT    ” I gesture for him to take off his headphones but he doesn’tGuy  “WHAT DO YOU WANT IM TRYING TO SHOP    I DONT WEAR MASKS   ”Me  almost yelling “I know sir but I can’t let you in if you’re not wearing pants ”The guy then swats his hand at me  almost hitting my face shield  grabs his cart and goes into the store  I grab the phone and dial the extension for any managers phone  When the manger on shift that night picks up he barely has a chance to say “hello ” before I interrupt him Me  “yeah hey  managers name  that guy with the headphones  yeah that one  no it’s not just the mask he doesn’t have pants on today”Manager  “what  Is he just naked ”Me  “no no he has boxer briefs on  super man ones actually  but very clearly not pants or even shorts”The phone hangs up on me and not  minutes later a cop car pulls up to the entrance  The cop and his partner nod their heads at me and walk into the store  Another few minutes pass and I am able to witness the guy being escorted out the doors  I  think  he was given a ticket but I’m not too sure  and escorted to his bike Not the most amazing ending but definitely a shift I will remember for a while,3296,607
23,p5qxfy,1,11,Im just blind deaf and dumb  what do I know   So a little context is necessary  I used to work as a bagger janitor at a supermarket in the Midwestern US  and we had an overwhelmingly larger amount of elderly customers than we did younger or middle aged customers  so we got something like this happening every now and then  My store would send out ads in the local paper to let people know what sales we have  but the ads themselves were unnecessary for buying anything  since you would get the discount for just scanning your card into the thing at checkout That said  one day I was bagging for lne of our older cashiers  lets call him Jim  and this elderly gentleman gets in line and wants to buy a number of items we had on sale that day  and asks how to scan the ad he brought with him to get the discount  Im barely paying attention at first because I dont realize something funny is going on  but when I realize Jim is calling for a manager because he cant figure this out  hes new and hes up there in years himself   I start listening and asking question  telling the customer that all he needs is his store card  which the manager repeats fifteen seconds later He scans his card and pays  leaving the store with the quote  Well  Im just blind deaf and dumb  what do I know   Which went on to become a running joke between me and Jim,1354,251
24,p5p05z,1,7,No  that makes you cheap  My first time posting a full story anywhere on here   Long time lurker   Etc  etc     This will probably ramble on but I think its worth it   Its been awhile ago so some of this wont be   accurate   but its basically what happened TL DR at the bottom Before I started my current career as  That IT Guy  I worked in the wonderful world of retail   This story is from when I worked at an upscale Grocery Housewares AllThingsFancy store that was specific to the Southeast United States   Lets call it      NorthernTime This would have been      years ago during the happiest time of the year  Read Christmas  So Im sure you all know how the Christmas season works when you work retail   All hands on deck from Thanksgiving until the middle of January  at least thats how it was then    This was ALSO the only time of the year where Over Time was not only allowed it was encouraged  it wasnt corporate run at the time and they made BANK during the Holidays due in part by the implied status of gifting something from this store plus the fact that we were the only retailer in the state that offered certain items  I was a full time  Associate  in the Housewares department that had been working there for about  years at that point   Since most of the other employees were temporary teenagers that had no idea what was going on other than  put on shelf  and  sell the thing  it was up to me  the other couple of full timers  and the assistant manager to actually make decisions about what stock would be placed where TL DR  Cheap Bastard tries to game overly lenient return policy  or lack thereof  to get Christmas items at post Christmas prices   I tell him he is cheap because Im overworked and over the holidays by that point   He complains and management agrees with me,1821,328
25,p5nhvc,1,18,Somebody is going to have a very bad day  Happened this weekend  I was working the closing shift on the register  like usual  and the weather was really nice after a hot week so most everyone was in a really good mood  Except this one girl She was  to  Id guess  was browsing around for a while and finally came to the register with a  inch folding knife  no biggie  I rang it up and asked if she had found everything she needed  She asked if we sold tasers and I told her we didnt but kind of as a joke told her we had some cattle prods  She thinks for a few seconds and then asks if they would kill a person  serious as anything  I got out of a joking mood quick and told her I had no idea  she thought for a few more seconds and then asked where they were and I told her  She headed that way as I suspended the transaction and went to the next customer She must have slipped out the door while I was busy with other customers because I didnt see her after that  Im not sure what was going on in her life but I got the idea she was really pissed about something and someone was going to have a bad time of it  Ill keep an eye on the local news and let you know if she crops up,1195,243
26,p5kx33,1,13,Can you ask your supervisor  I am a european citizen and my native language is not english and because i am on my laptop and i do not have an autocorrect there probably will be wrong spelling or whatever  So this story takes place in a local grocery store and i think we are on of the only ones that are open till  h in the city   We actually have a lot of costumers coming in after  h   We still have to wear masks when we enter any kind of building or the train It was a busy day in general but i didnt have a lot of people in line when the security comes walking in and behind im two boys  At first i didnt realize them talking to me as i had other costumers but then i heard them asking for masks as they werent wearing one  The security is faster than i am and gets them a pack of masks and the costumers in line let me ring them up So we have those card devices where you can either just put the card on top and it will transfer just like that or you can insert the card but you can also swipe it at the side  The last option is basically never used because normally all cards have chips and can be used with the other to options  Not the card of the young fellow wanting to buy the mask  But the device at my register was like lose and fixed onto its holder so you wouldnt be able to swipe your card  this sentence hurt my head and i hope its understandable but i dont even know what the things with which the divce was fixed are called in my native language excuse me So i have a collegue passing by who cuts up the thing fixing the device so the young man can swipe his card  what he did and my colluege fixed the device back onto its holding   once again i hope its understandable  i go on with my life but there they are the two young man back on my register which is the only open register with the problem with the card device  The man with the card laughs and says they are back and why i fixed the device because i should have known that he wanted to enter the store and buy things  So i make sure he can swipe his card  But he also wants to buy tabacco which we have behind glass  so we have to get up and get it for the cosutmer  But turns out he doesnt want tabacco but a cartoon of cigarettes  whichis ten packs  which we dont have  I tell him we do not have those to which he replies that that cant be true and he is sure we have them and i should ask my supervisor  who clearly doenst has something better to do   I ask over my headset if we have those and as i said my supervisor says we do not have them  so they buy like five packs and some alcohol and go on  But here is the thing  They where coming over the border from another country and both didnt have their ids with them  they had someone else buy the alcohol and the cigarettes  since i couldnt check their age  and this young man also had a really weird wound on his head that was actually quite deep and looked like it should be seen by a medical professional,2964,592
27,p5h6mg,1,73,The deal is the same thing right  At my store we always have a good deal  They always change so that customers have a variety of good stuff each time they come  but it can get confusing sometimes  For example  we have buy one  get one free  buy two  get one free  and buy two  get two free  Since alot of stuff is like that most cashiers have to figure out the deals on screen since it’s automatic A sweet old lady came into my store today and was getting two sodas  Our deal was buy two get one free and we do ask if they want an extra incase they want the deal  I asked if she wanted another box  She looks at me confused and said “what do you mean  Its buy two get one free right ”  I nodded “yes would you like us to get you a third one ” She looks confused “no its buy two get one free ”  my bagger and I looked at each other confused  My bagger says “um ma’am… you buy two you get another free” the lady looked annoyed “no no I know I get one free”  “I think you may be thinking about our buy one get one free deal “ she kinda yells “NO” and She pulls out a flyer with soda labeled “Coke products  buy two  get one free” she looks at me and with the upmost confidence says “Im a math teacher  I know how this works”Huh     I felt she was confused and wouldn’t accept that you needed a third for the deal to work  I ended up giving it to her for free with manager’s approval  She leaves  The next customer behind her comes up confused after hearing our conversation I feel like I should of explained that better  but then again she felt so certain she was in the right  Just feel so confused in that conversation…,1626,317

29,p52ehm,1,3,A fun little customer service interaction The reason I am writing this is yesterday I had a customer in his late s early s walk in  He wasnt a difficult person to deal with or anything and I had him at the checkout counter in about a minute or less  Now the scanners at the place I work dont always boot right at the start of day  so they error on the first scan then take a couple seconds to get working  So I do a small joke where I lightly hit the top of the scanner to get it to work  naturally it doesnt do anything  but to someone who doesnt know it can be funny  So when I was interacting with this customer the scanner hadnt booted right  so I did the joke and after the scanner worked the man said   It must be a female This isnt someone I know or was making dark jokes with  but a complete stranger who said it with a sense of pride and enough seriousness to know he wasnt kidding I hate people,926,180
30,p51tl0,1,73,I had a literal brawl break out at the store today Its a bit of a story but bear with me  There was a woman  who Ill call customer A  that was trying to use self checkout  She didnt have enough money on her card so the purchase was declined  This frustrated her and she started screaming  First at me for some reason  then she started screaming at her son to put back his drink  He started crying and she started screaming more and threatening him Another woman  customer B  saw this and ran over to intervene  She started screaming at A not to scream at the kid and how she was humiliating him  They argued back and forth for a bit before A stormed out of the store  B got back in line  I checked her out and thought that was the end of it  Not too long later I hear a lot of noise from just outside  followed by loud screaming and crying  I run out to investigate and find A on the ground screaming with her kids also crying loudly next to her Apparently customer B came outside and just started wailing on her  She punched A in the head multiple times  pushed her into the public trash can  which was knocked over  and slammed her head into the wall  Judge from the giant bruise on her face I had no reason not to believe her  Cops and ambulance were called  apparently A has seizures and was worried the beating might set them off  While reviewing what footage we had of the incident later we do have B on camera punching A in the back of the head at least once  Another customer got her license plate and we gave that to the cops  hopefully they can find the attacker,1583,301
31,p4od5f,1,13,Follow your gut feeling  This is one of the moments that I worried and was scared   Next to old men hitting on me   I was spraying carts and using the tablet to count people as well as handing out masks  when I saw a man walk in with a bang bang weapon   I’m calling it bang bang because I don’t know if I’m allowed to say the weapon   We had to report this over the walkie talkies  About  minutes later cops showed up  This was different because usually a security guard just follows them around  But  my gut told me that the cops needed to be called and that this man didn’t have a permit or good intentions  So they called the cops even though usually we don’t  Because they believed me which made me happy  The cops then were stationed at the front of the store about every three to five checkouts and worked their was back towards electronics  We were told to stand behind this wall in case it got dangerous  We saw the man walking around hand on the weapon  Calling this into the walkies  They got the man and he had stolen multiple games and was planning to steal a PS  The man was crying as he was handcuffed and out into the cop car  He didn’t have a permit for the bang bang  This man had been planning to do anything for the ps  I realised if I hadn’t called it in the situation would have been worse  All the schools saying  see something say something really came in handy that day  I know people have the right to carry bang bang items  But we had a threat so we were told to say something this would just have a security person keep an eye on them  We didn’t confront them the only one ever confronted was this guy  This was because that was the way I profiled judged him  Unlike everyone else who owns a gun his wasn’t in a holster it was stuck in his pants  He kept trying to pull his shirt down on the side the gun was like he was hiding it  He also kept looking around and trying to avoid eye contact with employees  When he walked by his eyes stayed on the security office door  Those things had me a little worried which is why I called it in  Having a bipolar schizophrenic Mom  who becomes paranoid he was doing similar things  It was just a situation that my gut told me something was wrong  I was right to follow my gut  So always follow your gut because it might just save you or save someone else and help prevent a disaster  He also had stolen like    in stuff so it wasn’t ending well for him  This actually scared me a lot especially since we had been doing these viruses on shootings in the work place,2540,488
32,p4k6je,1,74,Customer Wont Let Bully Take All The Clearance Meat Ive worked in the meat department at grocery stores for over  years   Many years ago at one of the stores we had a policy that around  or  PM we would go through the sales case and grab any meat that was expiring the next day  and mark them all down to around   There was one regular customer we had that our clerk called  The Meat Bully    He was an older gentleman who would arrive in the early afternoon and watch us like a vulture until we brought the reduced product out to our clearance section  and then fill his shopping cart with almost everything  for some reason he never grabbed any lamb or veal    We had a number of complaints from other customers about how there was  nothing left in our reduced section  but also because  Meat Bully  would push others out of his way to get his precious cheap meat There was another regular customer   Farm Woman   an older woman who lived on a farm  who one day decided to do something about our clearance problem As I was putting reduced prices on the product  I noticed both Meat Bully and Farm Woman waiting and watching me  and giving each other the stink eye   Once I was down I brought the rack out and put the cheap meat into the sales case as fast as I could   When I was done and backed away the two of them went right at it  pushing and shoving each other  grabbing whatever meat they could and tossing it into their carts After a minute or two the clearance section was wiped out and they walked away to continue their shopping   Over an hour later Farm Woman came back and put most of what she grabbed back into the clearance display   I came up to her and asked   Is there anything wrong with this   Did you change your mind  She smiled at me and answered   Oh no  theres nothing wrong   I just didnt want  Meat Bully  to take all your cheap stuff   This way everyone else has a chance to buy some  I sighed for a moment and smiled   I appreciate the thought  maam    but then grabbed a couple of packages she had put back   As I suspected they were room temperature   I continued   But we cant sell meat thats been unrefrigerated this long   Unfortunately well have to throw this all out   Oh  Im sorry    she muttered  frowning as she realized that her good deed had been for nothing  walking away glumly Thankfully Farm Woman never tries that again   A few weeks later the company would change our clearance policy to where we didnt reduce the prices so drastically  and though Meat Bully continued shopping there he wasnt nearly as aggressive,2586,478
33,p4h11d,1,22,Try Again  This story happened a few days ago and I still get a bit of a kick out of it To set the scene  I work at a grocery store as a cashier  It’s about  PM  and we have several checkouts open at this time  Things are moving along without issue and it’s just the slog of greet  scan  pay  repeat I come to the end of another order and the customer tells me he’s paying with credit  Sounds good  I do what I need to do on my end and wait as he does his stuff  An error message appears  Not unusual  sometimes they’re actually using a debit card  sometimes they take the card out too early  However I had never seen this message before  “Try again ”That’s odd  Well we just got new registers so maybe it’s just rephrasing one of the old messages  It’s clear as day  so I inform the customer we need to try again  He’s fine with this and we proceed as usual “Try again ”Right then  let’s try again  We redo the payment yet again while the customer and I begin discussing what to do if it doesn’t work again  At this point I flag down a manager for help and they just yell over “Try again error ” Slightly annoyed It was at this point that I looked up and down the checkout to see this same scene repeated at every register  One of the customer service employees who had come out to see what was happening just started going “Oh no  Oh no no no ”The entire card processing system had gone down The poor managers  They start making phone calls while all us cashiers just have to stand around and inform our lines of what was happening  The guy I was serving didn’t have cash and the managers were a bit busy so my line was going nowhere fast  Everyone just resigned themselves to wait and see what would happen next Thankfully  they must have gotten to the right people because a few minutes later it comes down the line to try running card again  so we repeat the age old song and dance and hooray  It’s working again So definitely an anticlimactic ending  but there was definitely a scare there  I can only imagine what would have happened if we hadn’t gotten the system up again,2102,388
34,p4gy9z,1,203,Officer  he wont refund me cash for my gas   From my gas station days in     About a year into working there  my station joined in several others to switch over to pre pay only pumps  I personally would see drive offs a few times every time I worked  so I was happy to see the change  Customers  however  resisted the change as much as they could from threatening to not get gas here anymore to get me to turn on the pump for them because our system still allowed it for semi truck drivers that use special cards to pay One day  a lady I never seen before  our Karen  pulls up to the pump  and grabs the nozzle  expecting me to turn on the pump for her  I announce over the speakers the same speech Ive been giving everyone that wont read the prepay signs on the pumps  and continue to wait on other customers in my line  She ignores me at first  but hangs up the nozzle after a minute and makes her way into the store  I finish the customer between her and me and she starts in at me about not letting her get gas outside  I politely tell her were a prepay only store now  and shell have to put money into a pump before getting her gas  She seems confused at first  but we get through the transaction with her putting in   unleaded onto a debit card and she heads out to pump her fuel  She doesnt put the whole   into her vehicle  and heads back in to speak to me After I get the customers in between me and her  she wants the cash for the fuel she didnt used  Now  it my bad for forgetting to tell her gas prepays on any card are automatically refunded once the nozzle is hung back up onto the pump  I tell her this and I have no way to give her cash back from the transaction  mentioning it may take a day for the refund to appear on her bank statement  She gets mad  demanding I give her cash for the fuel  I repeat myself  apologizing for the misunderstanding and say she still has the money  its just on her card  She leaves the store  and I think Im done with her  Nope I continue on my work in between helping customers in the store for several minutes and I look  outside  A cop has pulled up to Karens car and shes talking to him  occasionally pointing at the store and I already see the headache coming  I tell my co worker to run register as the cop comes in and he asks to speak to me  I greet him and ask what he needs  He informs me that Karen called the cops  saying we were refusing to give her her money back for the fuel while being really rude to her  I tell him what happened  how refunds for gas work  and if he wishes  he can come back with me to the cameras to watch the footage   He says thats okay and hell inform her of what actually happened  I dont see the cop and lady talk as a rush hits the store then  but one of my regulars saying that lady flip me off after she got into her car so the cop wouldnt see her do it,2881,561
35,p4dziv,1,12,I have been abused  So  this is a story that mostly happened to a co worker of mine  but since I was involved as well  I thought it was worth sharing  amp  xB A couple of days ago I was working the register when a woman  her husband and their  children came up to me  The woman  lets name her Karen for no reason whatsoever  asked me where she could file a complaint because she had been abused  I explained to her that we have a front desk where they handle complaints but she didnt seem satisfied because she asked who my manager was and wanted a description of what she looked like  I told her my managers desk is at the front desk so chances were shed be over there  She asked if it was that woman she saw earlier wearing a cardigan  I had to stop myself from sarcastically replying that yes  sure  shes the one woman in this whole building wearing a cardigan  As I explained for the rd time where she should go with her complaint  as Im not qualified to deal with that  she continued yelling that she has never been treated that way  she didnt know what she did wrong and that she was completely shaken because she has been attacked by the personnel  I told her I dont know what happened and rang her up  while she was shouting at me for not even asking her loyalty card  she never gave me the chance to actually ask her inbetween her ranting   Now  after all of that  youd think that she really had the worst experience one can have while going shopping  At the time I really did not know what had happened  but I found out the next day and well    prepare for an anti climax We have a lot of students working their summer jobs at my workplace  One of the students was working at the clothing department at her desk that happened to be in an aisle  The thing about working in retail is  there often is no place to work at where you arent in the way of the customers  which usually isnt a problem because there are other ways to pass by or they could just ask like decent human beings  Karens husband walked behind the table the student was working at to look at some clothes  That student was looking at Karen  wondering if she also had to be there or was just waiting on her husband  Out of nowhere  Karen started shouting that the student was looking at her  aggressively   The student went up to my co worker  in tears  to tell her what happened  so my co worker decided to go up to the aisle to see what happened  She asked Karen if there was a problem she could help with  but she just continued shouting  saying that she had no way to pass by and that the student was purposely blocking her  My co worker calmly explained to her that there were many openings through which she could pass by  but Karen didnt believe her and her husband also got upset because of  how his wife was treated  After going to file her complaint at the front desk  Karen insisted that the assistent store manager would go to the clothing department with her to demand an explanation  She belittled my co worker  saying that she was scared to tell her employer the truth  My co worker said that she had no problem  telling her boss what happened  but not while Karen was still there  About  minutes later  she passed my register again to proudly announce that she went to complain as if I was supposed to congratulate her  I just shrugged at her and was happy to know that that woman would be the joke of the day,3436,634
36,p45cqb,1,17,Homeboy doesnt like my customer service   the Sequel  Greetings       The saga continues of Graveyard shift at the gas station  Odark thirty adventures  Thursday night  a regular customer whos been coming in for months  came in to buy his regular thing of a pack of Marble O Black cigarettes        He always buys those cigarettes  sometimes he also gets a soda  sometimes he gets a lighter but its always those cigarettes that he buys        Not Thursday  no      Thursday  he angrily marches up to the counter and starts swearing at me words that I cant post here  but censoring out the profanity he says   Hey       Youve been giving me attitude and I dont like that         Did you shut off my gas the other night          The one word I got in edgewise during this whole exchange was   Yes        Homie continued his ranting and cursing saying that that wasnt right  that he was going to report me to corporate because I   was a        amp                     gave bad customer service  and he stomped out  amp  xB What happened  amp  xB Flashback to late Monday night  Homie came to the teller window and asked for his Marble O cigarettes  as per usual   and  wanted to pay for some gas        Slipping two   dollar bills into the drawer  he said that he wanted the cigs and   bucks at pump   too         Now unfortunately  due to the thick safety glass  all I heard was that he wanted gas at the pump  so I rang up the cigarettes  then rang up the remainder of his forty     dollars  about   bucks  to pump         As I gave Homie his cigarettes through the window drawer  he asked  Wheres my change Realizing my error  I turned back to the register and tried to void the transaction before the pump turned on        That managed to stop the signal  but also caused the old register to freeze up        A few tries to get it unfrozen  failed and I had to tell Homie that all we could do was wait for the register to unf       itself        Not happy cuz he had things to do  Homie replied that hed go pump his gas and come back and get his change in a minute         Not waiting for my explanation  he took off to find out that the pump wasnt going to work  for himself Homie returned pissed off now  and just wanted his money back for the gas  saying hed go across the street       He had wanted    in gas  so I gave him back one of his    dollar bills         Wheres my change     He demanded again  so again I tried to explain that I couldnt get change out of the register because it was frozen      Now  Homie was demanding  all  of his money back          If you want it all back   then give me back the cigarettes  okay   was my reasonable reply        He was not okay with that  but wanted his money  and tossed the cigs in the drawer        To which  I returned his remaining                  Off Homie stormed to his car  and of course   thats  when the register came back to life          Ping  went the register  and Ping  went pump    which had finally been activated         What to my wondering eyes did Homie do        He tried to take the gas         He had the fueling nozzle in his hand and was about to put it in his car and BEEEP       I turned off his gas pump   Yup  Homie may not have liked my customer service  but I was  not  going to give him free gasoline,3355,749
37,p43d94,1,10,I messed up    Heyy  I’m new to my job and started just under two months ago doing two night shifts a week at a petrol station  I work alone  Anyway  I had finished a  hour hospital shift for my uni course  am    pm  and was scheduled in for work at the petrol station the same night  which I agreed to  from pm to am  I was exhausted  to say the least  I found myself making a lot of mistakes with the money and nearly giving customers too much change  they were honest and said it was too much so that wasn’t an issue   which isn’t like me at all  When printing out a voucher code for a customer the printer had an error  and for some reason it didn’t occur to me to just reprint the receipt  I just redid the transaction  This meant that the till was £ down  I feel absolutely terrible  I’m trying my hardest to manage everything and took on more than i could handle  Just wanted to vent really  it’s getting challenging to manage all of this at once,967,187
38,p3zr75,1,4,A good day for a picnic  When I was younger I worked in retail management for about  years  tons of stories to potentially share but this one is the one that I just have to share  The store where I worked was basically in between a senior living facility and a halfway house so we got all sorts of goofy clientele  One day about  weeks after being promoted to management I got to work and noticed a regular client walking around with her daughter  She had been known for being a little off so to keep an eye on her is what I was told  I couldnt believe my eyes in broad daylight while looking at toys her and her daughter sat down in the middle of the aisle and pulled out a picnic blanket and sandwiches  I was a bit shocked to say the least and was halve tempted to just let them eat  Needless to say I had to ruin their picnic and give them the boot,856,171
39,p3t64a,1,34,Youre gonna go far kid  I managed a retail store for over  years  I have a ton of things to share  This is one of those things that sticks out in my mind  We hired a lot of kids that were straight out of high school and they were usually irresponsible and didnt want to work  We hired Jack  He seemed to be one of the more hard working people we had hired in a long time  But after so long he started calling off a lot  After  write ups  it was automatic termination at our place and at this point Jack was on his last chance  He called in saying something about needing emergency surgery and we told him  ok  but make sure you bring in a note so we can excuse this  After his next shift  a note was found in the managers office  It was a green post it note  written in Jacks handwriting stating that he had been at the hospital having emergency surgery and was to be excused from his shift You can guess what happened next,932,183
40,p3j122,1,26,Something really sweet happened today  A few weeks ago we had a customer leave their credit card in my shop by accident  They phoned to check it was there  but they had already left town by that point so they asked us to send it to them  We did  registered post so we got confirmation of a signature  and disguised inside a parcel so that it wasn’t obvious what was being sent   This morning we got a parcel back  A lovely hand written thank you note with a book from my favourite author  that had come up in conversation when they were in the shop   Just a little note that I work in a very small shop that my husband and I run  so I didn’t need to check with a boss about policy or anything,699,136
41,p3fcoi,1,83,Dude just dropped and item off and walked out with another instead of doing an actual exchange At work yesterday this guy came in with an unopened deodorant and said he got the wrong one for his wife and asked if he could exchange it  I said yes of course  and he asked if he could leave the old one at the register so he could grab the correct one  Thinking nothing of it  I assumed  like any reasonable person  or so I thought  that he would grab the new one and then come to the register to complete the exchange  Wrong  His wife met him a few min later  they grabbed the new one  and just   left with it  Has this guy never shopped anywhere in his whole life  Like  ever  Thats not how you do an exchange  I tried to get their attention as they were leaving because they stopped by the door for a moment to say something to each other but as I tried to say  hey arent you doing an exchange   But they ignored me and left  and were gone before I could get a manager to the front  I could maybe understand more if it was a small boutique store or something but I work at a large chain store  so it doesnt make sense  Im still trying to wrap my mind around this one  Guy was wearing a mask but probably in his late s  kinda looked like Shaggy from Scooby Doo but with a longer beard,1294,254
42,p3d8zy,1,25,impossible customers every now and then i get a customer who is so instantly upset by something i say or do that it really seems like not having upsetting them would be impossible   for example  the other day a lady walked into the garden center where im a cashier and asked me  with a little hostility  where our peonies were   i said i wasnt sure if we had any and asked if they were perennial or annual because wed definitely not have them if they were annual   just this upset her   customers dont seem to understand that not every employee knows everything about the store and that some of their questions can only be answered by asking the right person   as a cashier  i am that wrong person to ask   i am not intimately familiar with our stock since im legit not allowed to leave my cash and dont get to see where things have been moved or added or run out of stock throughout the day week   she said they were perennial and i told her wed just gotten a shipment of perennials in so if she wanted to take a look around  shed be getting first pick   this was too much and she got nasty   well  of youre not willing to come show me what you have in stock  i dont see why i should even shop here   at that she turned around and left   just left   through the parking lot  i could hear her yelling this is the worst customer service i have ever had   unbelievable i mean    why did she even come in   i mean  thats a pretty big shift to make from fully intending to shop to leaving in outrage in like thirty seconds if she was actually intending to shop,1580,308
43,p387tl,1,35,A run for my money at an INconvenience store So back in the day I was working for an In convenience store back in the day  This place wasnt in a necessarily rough neighborhood  Ive worked much worse in the past   but there were just enough High School and College Aged kids to get real annoying real quick  This particular store has doors that lock with the push of a button behind the register  Pretty cool actually  and important detail for later  Also an important detail  my managers a genius  so they have me put a big stack of beer right by the front register  You know  so the beer run guys can see how close the beer is to the door from OUTSIDE   Curly Haired kid comes in after just walking around the parking lot for twenty minutes  and my spidey senses are tingling  I know this dude is going to Beer Run me  I just know it  He comes to my register and asks for a cigarette that happens to be very far up on the shelf  Ive had this happen before  someone asks for something thats hard to reach and when I turn my back theyre gone  Not THIS time    I then press the door lock button  which makes a very loud  clack   at the location of the door s  which was my way of letting him know that I knew what he was doing   Well  he evidently didnt notice  despite my sighs  despite my exaggerated movement towards the button  I was thinking to myself  the best person to really think to   What does this kid think Im doing   Maybe he was desperate  whatever  but as I turned around I hear a way more satisfying than anticipated THUD    as this kid  with an  pack in hand  slams into the locked doors  This kid was ON THE FLOOR  I have no idea how the pack in his hand didnt break  He then kept slamming against the door with his body  saying  Open this door  open this effing door right now     Time for some “next part of the story”I see this kid come back towards one side of the store and wind up to plow through this door  I know this kids gonna break the lock if he doesnt stop doing this      He makes one last long run at the door and then I press the unlock button last possible second  The kid flies  literally FLIES through the doors swinging open  tumbles to the ground outside  finally the  pack breaks  rolling everywhere  The kid picked up like four beers and just kept running,2323,433

45,p379ma,1,0,Worker Expects Me To Know Where To Deliver Just Based On A Name  So this happen today  And I’m glad I snapped at the coworker  Usually I’m a pretty quiet person  Whenever there’s a mistake  I don’t normally snap or get angry or anything like that  I just keep to myself  This worker  he makes mistakes all the time  And they aren’t small mistakes either  They are a big mistakes that often cost time and money  For example  this is something I’ll put in a future story  but the summary is  he put down I had to go to a certain town just over an hour away  to deliver something  when in reality  where I had to go was less than a  minute drive away   This coworker  just give you an idea  he feels like he’s a big boss  even though he’s not  When he makes a mistake  he tries to hide it  but when others make a mistake  and minor ones no where near his size of screw ups  he’ll give you crap for it   I don’t take him seriously if he gives me crap for a minor mistake I make once in a blue moon because they are nothing compared to his  Today I had a load of building materials to take to a contractor  So the bill I had  on the left side  there is the contractors name and home address  The left side is usually for account information to know who it’s being billed to  The centre column  is the ship to column and when that’s empty  you delivere to the account address  which was what this form had  The ship too column was empty  And on the right side of the form  is info  like who made the order  what the contractor wants as a PO  etc  So I drive out to the contractors home address  which was about a  minute drive  When I get there  the contractor is not there but his wife is  I told her that her husband ordered the stuff and my info said to delivered to his home address  She was confused  because she thought that order was supposed to go out to the jobsite he’s at  I phone the contractor  and he says it was supposed to come out to the jobsite  and he told me where it was  Luckily I haven’t unloaded any of the material yet  so I told him I’m on my way  So I had to drive  minutes back in the direction I just came from to get to where this contractor was  So I get the contractor his material  and I asked him “When this worker was doing the order  did you tell him it had to come to this address ” He said he told my coworker where it had to come  So when I get back to the store I was burning red  I checked with a few my yard guys  just to make sure they weren’t told something I wasn’t  But they all told me they were never told it had to come to that address that wasn’t on the order  So I go in and I see the worker  and I asked him “Did the contractor say it had to go to address B ” He told me yes  and I snapped right there  I said to him with my voice raising a little  “Why isn’t it on the order form ” He then says “I circled the name of the person ” I look in that PO field that I mentioned earlier  and I see a random person‘s name  but no other info  All it was was a name  I raise my voice more  and said to him “A name doesn’t help me  I have no idea who this guy is  Where he lives  or anything like that  Even if there was no address yet because the property was still under construction  there should be some sort of description like he’s a long road A  near intersection B  A simple little details on address can go a long way to make things a lot easier ”  My coworker said nothing  just turned back to his computer and continued his work  But my other coworkers nearby heard what I said  they all had small smiles on their faces  because they like it when they see this guy get trouble for a mistake he makes I’ll post some other stories about him in a few days  If anyone wants to hear more  let me know  and I’ll let you know when I post more on this guy  And sorry if things seem jumbled  I used voice dictation for most of this,3901,780
46,p2uhik,1,92,We Are Out of Ice  I work as a cashier in a large chain grocery store  We also sell ice  located in a large freezer near the front of the store next to the registers It was slowing down in the store and I had some return items at my till that needed to go back  We can either bring the items to customer service and they will return them to shelf  or we can go return them directly  The item I had was located in a nearby aisle so I decided to return it directly  Our large ice cooler is located at the end of this aisle  which is next to the registers  As we have been having a heat wave lately  our ice was sold out again today  As I turn up the aisle and pass the ice cooler  I hear a woman close the cooler door and comment out loud  Oh  Theres no more ice   I continue walking  return the item to shelf and as I turn around the woman is standing directly behind me  blocking my way out of the aisle and glaring daggers directly into my eyes  Me  cashier  C  customerC  Did you just IGNORE ME Me  Pardon  Did you need help with something C  Did you  Ignore  Me Me  No  not intentionally  I was retuning an item to the shelf  Sorry you had the impression I was ignoring yo C  Theres no more ice in the cooler Me  Yes  We are all sold out of ice   silence     She looks at me with a blank look and does not say anything else for seconds  seemingly unhappy with my answer Me  We dont have any more ice  We are sold out  C  Well where am I supposed to get my ice from  Me  You could try  gas station across the street   they usually have some   more silence  still glaring at me C  I came here to buy ice Me  We do not have any ice in stock at this time  C   waves her hand at me and turns to leave  Dont be so rude I really didnt think I sounded rude  and I was genuinely confused when she came up to me asking if I ignored her  She didnt address me directly at all before she confronted me  No  Hey   or  Scuse me  to get my attention   Although I did hear her say  Oh  Theres no more ice     it sounded more like an observation out loud rather than asking an employee if there was more somewhere else,2148,411
47,p2ubzx,1,23,Told customer I was a prisoner I used to work at a big box electronics store selling car stereo equipment  A decision was made only managers could open the door between the store and the install bay  Everyday customers would buy their stuff then have to wait for a manager to come open the door  So everyday I would be asked by every customer qhy dont they trust you to have a key  As a part time  for the discount  employee I usually would just shrug my shoulders  Then one day I was asked the question and for what ever reason I said maam Im hoping to earn that privilege   I went on to say I was a privileged prisoner from the local prison who was soo  to be released and was earning a place in the store back in my community upon release  The manager came and let her out to get her stuff installed  A few days later I came into work to see the district manager waiting on me  Evidently she sent an email to corporate commending them on the prison work program  Luckily I didnt really get in trouble but they were not impressed with my laughter,1053,203

52,p22djl,1,123,Customer gets mad when I don’t let her break the law…again  Earlier today  I was working my shift at a convenience store when a woman came inside  After a moment or so  she approached my register  and asked for some cigarettes in a very snotty  annoyed fashion  She swore at me when I mistakenly thought she asked for Marlboros when she really wanted Paul Malls  She also looked as trashy as her attitude  emaciated body that aged  years ahead her actual age  crooked brown teeth  and unkempt hair and clothes  I didn’t think she was trashy based on her appearance  her attitude was trashy  and her appearance happened to reflect that Anyway  after I rang up her order  I asked for ID  as was standard of our store policy  She bregrudgingly handed me her driver’s license  and when I scanned it  it came back as being expired since   I showed my supervisor  and she politely informed the lady that  by law  we couldn’t sell her any tobacco with an expired ID  My supervisor and I had then the following exchange with her  with the lady customer being snarky and bratty through it all Lady  You guys didn’t f  king card me the last time I was here Supervisor  Doesn’t matter  it’s still against the law Me  This license expired  years ago Lady  Well  duh  I was in prison for  years  I just got out of f  king prison Supervisor  Don’t care  I had another customer to attend to  so I didn’t hear the rest of the exchange  The lady ended up walking away empty handed  My supervisor said I made the right call carding the lady  Our store would’ve gotten in huge trouble for selling things like tobacco and alcohol illegally  I now card just about anyone buying smokes or booze since  You’d think spending  years in jail would’ve made somebody learn NOT to break the law  Hope it doesn’t take another  years to get it through her head TL DR  Ex con tries to buy cigarettes with an expired license from   years ago  She argued with me and my supervisor for a while  but ended up leaving empty handed,2023,356
53,p1p5za,1,3,Dealing with the public is fun     like bathing in acid  So a few tales from when I worked in furniture delivery       So we got a call to deliver a queen size mattress  foundation and bedroom set  now there are a few personal rules when delivering furniture  Due to my size and height If i cant walk through a door without turning sideways  i am two feet and a half feet across the shoulders  a standard couch isnt going to fit and if I have to duck going up a flight of stairs  Im  feet  inches tall  a queen sized foundation isnt going to fit either  We get to the customers home and the first thing to go wrong is that I have to duck going up to stairs  I knew that the foundation wasnt going up those stairs  We did it our best shot and it just wouldnt go  The customer decided that we were idiots and said   Ive moved furniture before and I know it will fit   My coworker and I look at each other with the same thought  The hell you think we do for a living  Not the first thing we said  but the first thing we thought  She tried for several minutes to get it up the stairs herself before admiring we were right and deciding to set the bed up in a room on the first floor      We offered free delivery for all orders  This man comes in and buys a big couch   The salesman offers to have it delivered  Customer refuses and says hell take it home himself  my coworker and I took the couch out to his vehicle expecting he had a truck of some kind  nope  minivan  The couch hung out the back about  inches so the back hatch wouldnt close  We had some rope and managed to secure the couch and tie the door down so it wouldnt move too much  Found out later on that he had to have his door fixed because he hit a bump and bent the door enough that it wouldnt latch properly  Thank God for liability waivers  He threatened to sue the store but he had sign an agreement that said we took no responsibility for damages cause because the customer refused delivery and did it themselves  paraphrasing of course because I cant think of the correct phrasing right now   Gotta love it when people destroy their own property and blame it on you  We even told him this wasnt the best idea  but he just said  Nah itll be fine   The owner one day decided that he was spending too much money on delivery when we made long distance deliveries  His grand money saving idea was to tell us that the drive to the customers home and back didnt count towards our paid hours and only when we got there and delivered the product would count towards hours and as soon as we got back in the truck the clock stopped  You can imagine how that went with my coworker and I  As soon as he finished explaining the plan  we looked at him and said  good luck finding some one to work like that cause we wont  As I said before Im a giant and my coworker wasnt much smaller than me  No one was gonna work under those conditions  He insisted and we told him best of luck and  went to lunch and didnt come back for a couple hours to show him he wasnt going to push us around  and that he would never find anyone who was gonna work like that  He called us back and said he changed his mind and wasnt going to follow through with the plan,3235,631
54,p1p3xz,1,119,Thats My Mom  Maam   A little quick story from a couple days ago Its about an hour before closing  and my mom was on the register while I was bagging  Yes  we work at the same store  My mom is about to pull her till and count it so she can leave When she does this  I start preparing to fill any empty milk  egg  or bread shelves  Mom says the usual  Okay  Im counting my drawer down  then Ill be going home  Love you  See you at home  A customer on the next register hears this and says something along the lines of  Those two shouldnt be working together if they live together  and hes still young  He could do so much better than an older woman  Her cashier  who Im friends with  calls me over  She asks the woman to repeat what she just said  and the woman does so Me   Well  thats just your opinion  and I respect that  but maam   thats my mom  She looks so embarrassed  She just finishes her transaction and leaves without saying anything else  Havent seen the woman since,1004,180
55,p1idoq,1,65,I didnt know it was my responsibility So many people DO NOT use the grocery dividers AND stand real close to the other family  that I often start scanning the next customers order  In fact  some families are same order  just make sure they are separate as we bag  so there is a small space btwn items  and then I think well thats the next customer   My eyes are mostly on the items as they are being entered  make sure they are getting entered  noise level vs beep  and correct price item   This means  my eyes are not anywhere near the end of the belt   No one has arms large enough to reach and put the divider btwn shopping orders All of this said  and I get a customer who told me I had no idea I was supposed to put the divider up  Really  I get not wanting to reach over the belt  though you want me to reach even further for your water soda   or thinking you can pay enough attention to keep me from starting to grab your items  But  not know its on the customer,983,186
56,p1gtub,1,6,How My Day ar Work Went Today So I work at little chain hardware store   Bowls  idk you mightve heard of it  Ive been working there for about  weeks and this has by far been the most eventful day An important thing to know before I begin is that we recently got self check out registers and those registers only take card  Becuase of this we have a register open in case somebody wants to pay with cash  The self check out lanes are always open and we have at least  person there watching over the registers  The store has recently hired a lot more front end people  so now we have an abundance of front end people  So now we have at least  people at the registers   at self check out and the other at a normal register Since weve gotten self chec out there have been A LOT of comments around them and many people have offered some sort of variation of  self check out is stealing jobs  I shall present you todays events in order of appearance  And honestly  thank God were required to wear masks because they have worked wonders in amplifiying my poker face and hiding my wtf faces   A couple around   came in and were standing behind a guy that looked around   Theyve come in before and have offered their opitions of self check out each time I helped them out  When I was checking out the  yr old  his total came out to  X and  cents  The guy paid with a  and when the couple heard want his change would be   X and  cents   the wife offered him  cents so that way hed only get bills back instead of a bunch of coins  I though that was very sweet of them and though this time would be a bit different As I started scanning them the husband began with the usual comments about how our jobs is begin stolen to me and my coworker and self check out and then began recounting their experience in a New Mexico  Gualmart   They said that it was a ghost town and the only thing open was the self check out  then his wife came in and said that because the store was located on a reservation the natives took over the store The wife then went on to say that people that use self check out are all sheep and her husband finished off with   Who do I need to talk to to get rid of these fucking machines   My coworker responded   Well sir we conduct an online survey  you can fill it out and share your thoughts there  After I handed them their reciept  highlighted  and pointed out where they can find the surevy the husband looks me in the eye and says   Cool thank you  youre doing a great job OP  keep it up  and they left with another quick goodbye to my coworker and I TBH they were really nice just   intense  An older man around  came in and was at the end of a rather long line waiting for my register  In the background the head cashier was conducting an observation of me and my coworker  they do them monthly and its just to make sure everyone is doing what their supposed to   Then the guy came up I switched with my cowrker so she could be observed  When I left the register the guy said   Awe you dont want to check my out  No sir  Id love to but we have to switch off every so often but Ill be here if you need anything else   Aaahhhhh I shouldve said that  turns to coworker  you have to be very careful nowadays  you cant saying anothing or a female will get all mad  Like I cant even tell you how beautiful you look   And went on until the transaction was finished  all the while my coworker kept giving him one owrd answers and nodding  Meanwhile the head cashier and I are making a   at each other   I had to explain to an older couple  around ish  how what card pins  cash back  and debt accounts were   A woman wanting to do a propane excahnge  swap an empty tank for a new one   I rang her up and told to give me about   min and someone will meet you outside at the propane tanks to help her  She nods and leaves  Now our propane tanks are in a huge display directly to the left of our exit door  you cant miss them  I went to go grab the head cashier and told her someone paid for a propane exhange and she told me to come with so I could learn how to do it  So were waiting outside for about  minutes  no sign of her  We close up the display and go inside After about another  minutes the same coworker that was hit on by the weird old guy walked over from our lumber desk  end of the store by loading dock  and said  So theirs a woman outside lumber  she said she bought propane and has been sitting there waiting for someone to help her  I told her to comback over here  The head cashier and I were like wtf  So after ten minutes she came up to the register again  She was like  Ive been waiting outside forever no one came to help me  and so on and so on  Both the head cahsier and myself said  We were outside waiting for you but you never came   And she responded   Well I didnt see you  and the propane is NOT outside  now is sombody going toget me my propane     After a few more words were excahnged  the head cashier led her outside to swap her tank and that was the last we saw of her LoVe my job,5114,978
57,p0penh,1,40,Lol  Ive got a short tale for you all that you might enjoy  My supervisor has been having me cover breaks and lunches all day  and while I was on lane   when I had no customers  I waved over a nice gentleman who had a small cart of about   items  We talk and its a very pleasant conversation   but theres a line forming  so after he grabs his bags  he almost missed his meat  which Ive bagged separately   I see him off  and as Im scanning the lady behind him  I notice he missed a bag containing hot potato wedges  Hes almost at the door  so I dont have time to flag him down  I just hold onto his bag in case he comes back  Well  Im told to shut my light off and cover GM self checkout for a  minute break and then go on my lunch  so when I get through my line  I scribble a note on some receipt tape and I walk off  Probably about  minutes into the break Im covering  the guy who was on  asks supervisor where hes to go  and then he sees the potato wedges and starts calling  Supervisor  Supervisor   But the supervisor is too far off  so I ask him if he needs something He holds up the bag of potato wedges and asks for the context behind them  I tell him that they were left behind  and then he asks about the note   What does this mean  Lol      Am I missing a joke or something   I stare at him for a second   Left on lane,1371,273
58,p0c1dj,1,45,Secret until the end Hello  Its my first time posting here so if I need to correct anything or if this story doesnt belong here  Also english is not my first language Warning   funeral deathFor context  I work in a small workshop that sells products and customizes customers belongings  We do a lot of different products  and we all have assigned fields  Mine is engraving  which goes from bottles and glasses to granits A few years ago  an old gentleman  he had excellent manners  came to us asking questions about a granit plaque for funeral purposes  what we can give him  sizes  prizes  etc   Nothing out of the ordinary He asked for a drawing with a text that looked like a poem  all filled with gold leaves  engraved on granit plaque and put on a small pedestal We had other orders to fullfill and had to order the granit from another country so it would take us  months at least to complete the order  He didnt mind and left with a smile He proceeded to come back to see how his order evolved at least once a week  Always polite  good manners and a gentle smile The th or th time he came back  he told us that he was sorry for coming so much  that he was just nervous to pass away before it would be completed  It was really important to him and heres why He wanted to place this plaque on a womans grave  He fell in love with that woman when they were young  She fell in love this someone else  got married and had children  He lived a long and happy life  All this time  our customer had been in love with her  but respected her and supported her as a friend all his life  He never told her again about his feelings  never told anyone about it  and he was never able to stop loving her The poem talked about how two dancers met a summer night and shared a magical moment that they shared and will still exist when the night comes back Our customer wanted to do one last thing for her before he had to leave as well It was hard not to cry after hearing his story  and to this day it is one of the most significant event that happened to me on this job,2090,387
59,p06ehd,1,18,“But I’m A Nice Guy ” A bit of an ongoing story encasing the last month and a half  There’s this one customer I refuse to sell to  full stop no exception  For the past four months he’s usually rude AF when asked to do something that is legit just basic decency and common sense for customers in a store  don’t come behind the counter to grab an employee to get their attention  to grab the store phone  please don’t trash the place  please don’t call our female workers “girlfriend” especially the underage ones it makes them uncomfortable  etc etc  like he will throw attitude and respond with things like “Why ” And “do you want my business or not ” Which I want to say no I don’t but I keep my mouth shut  Well about a month ago I decided I had enough when he threw a fit about a price because I was a penny off in the after tax amount I gave him  A total I had to calculate mentally because he refused to pay at the register  Then he changed and said the amount I said  after tax  didn’t match what it listed x item as on receipt  he referred to the before tax amount  and every time I tried to explain that the amount I gave him was the amount after tax he interrupted me  like I could not get two words in before he complained that it says y amount on the item  THEN he went off about how I need to learn to do my job right and that I’m a bad employee if I don’t have the prices memorized  Again  I was only a penny off  So I walked away before I said something that would get me in trouble  Ever since I’ve refused to sell to him  the other employees are welcome to sell to him if they want  Every time he complains about me not selling to him  that he doesn’t get why I’d do that or why I don’t like him when he’s a nice guy  and that it’s unfair  To add  he had no intention to pay for the stuff he complained about  I intercepted him by chance when he was walking away with it  he apparently thought he got free food just for being there,1956,384
60,p05jsf,1,15,But we closed half an hour ago I was working in a pet supply store  and we also had cats from the RSPCA that we processed adoptions for  and because we liked the cats  we would lock the door at closing time  and just let the cats run around the store while we took our sweet time to cash up and play with the cats  before putting them back in their enclosure and head home  exiting out the front door  maybe half an hour or more after closing One hot summers day  we had been experiencing a heat wave for three or so days  when we did just that  and so it was half an hour after closing that we were walking towards the front  glass  door to leave when an older guy comes up to the door  it doesn’t open so he cups his hands around his face and sees us inside the darkened  no lights on store  and he yells “I need to come inside  I need clippers for my dog” “But we are closed” I replied “But I need clippers for my dog  it’s hot and I need them” “Yeah but we are closed  we closed half an hour ago  there are no registers on  so I can’t sell anything  sorry”It went on for another  mins and he was pissed  but he eventually left  Seriously dude  you wait until the third day of a heat wave  six hours after the peak temperature  at night  and half an hour after the shops are closed to come out to buy clippers   Heat wave ended that night anyway   which was what the weather report said would happen   and what the local weather is like every summer anyway 🤦🏼‍♀️,1475,290
61,p01lsr,1,23,Why me  I volunteer at a small charity shop  There is only one till which is at the far end of quite a long counter  which we use for cleaning sorting pricing donations   Now  I was not on the till  but was quite intensely scrubbing this glass bowl  I had pretty much completely zoned out of everything because I had been methodically cleaning donations for the past  hours  and no one had any need to approach me for anything  because a  I am clearly busy  and b  my colleague was standing just over a metre away from me at the empty till waiting for the next customer  The one thing I do respond to  is my name  There I was scrubbing  and my manager calls my name  so I quickly turn around and go  Yes   and she just looks at me in surprise  waves her hand at me and goes  Customer   like what an idiot  so I turn around and see a woman whos kind of smirking like she agrees with my manager that Im scatter brained  it is true   I first think shes going to ask me a question about how much something is  etc  But then she just hands a bunch of items  Bear in mind  with one hand Im holding a bowl with the other a cleaning cloth  my hands are covered in wiper spray and grime  I awkwardly place the bowl on the table  take the items  all the while staring at her in confusion thinking I must have missed something because what is happening  In the end I just kind of directly pass the items to my colleague at the till who starts scanning them in  and I just go back to cleaning  That was  hours ago  and I still have not come up with a reason why the customer handed me the items to purchase rather than the person working at the till,1650,317
62,ozxz05,1,6,still hate that she did this For reference  I live in the UK This short little story I have takes place a few years ago  when I was working in a charity shop One of the things sold in said shop is shoes  and one day I was carrying out the task of rotating stock  I was doing the shoes when this event occurred  In the grand scheme of things  its not a big deal  but I still think about it every so often So anyways  I was in the process of rotating the shoe stock when a customer came over and started talking to me  no big deal  right  Well  I was used to conversing with customers by this point  but what this customer did still irritates me to this day  She started pinching my cheeks I was about   so you can imagine how I felt about her doing that  At this point  my parents and I had only been living in our new house for a little while  and whilst I by no means know every single person on our street  I am now quite familiar with this woman  but at the time I didnt really know who she was  Maybe it was because my brain was in work mode  Im not sure Yes  the woman who came in and pinched my cheeks   on the shop floor  whilst I was working  is my neighbour This came to light a few days later  when she stopped by our house and said it was her who had visited the shop  Whilst I just replied with a simple   Oh  yeah   as if I suddenly remembered  that was not at all the response I wanted to give Feels good to finally get that story off my chest,1477,290
63,ozxule,1,39,Looking for a wine my daughter had with an obscure label  That pretty much sums it up  This was a few years ago  About   mins to close and lady comes into the liquor store  That’s generally enough time for most people to grab what they need and get out so I let her browse for a few minutes before asking if she needed help because now it is time to close  I didn’t usually mind letting people finish up for a few minutes if we locked the door didn’t let anyone else in and we always closed half of the shutters about  mins to closing Me  Do you need help finding anything Lady  I’m just browsing Me  Ok  it’s just that we close at  Lady  Well your sign was on  Me  Yes  because we were open when you walked in  now we are about to close  Her  I’m looking for a wine my daughter had with an obscure label Me   uh that could be anything  Ok  can you be more specific  Do you know what style it was  What country Her  No  maybe a guess at a colour of label Me  Ok  I’m sorry I don’t know what that could be  If you know of anything you’d like  I can still check you out before we close Her   in an annoyed tone  Well never mind then  I just assumed you were open because you had the sign on  …ok lady  Yes we were open  now we are closing  You are also very vague and I have no idea out of hundreds of wines which one with an obscure label by your standard is the one your daughter had,1404,271
64,ozrejj,1,42,Little kid  big kleptomaniac Last summer  I had my first thief encounter  I worked in a small bookstore that also sells a variety of other items  including stationary  We also had a small toy aisle At the time of this story we knew there had been some theft  as my boss had found an empty package on a shelf with the toy ripped from it I was behind the register when i spotted a kid  around  y o maybe   in a puffy jacket  I’d seen him acting shifty before  so I kept an eye on him  And yup  I watched him grab an expensive toy from the back of the store before heading down to the register where he asked me to return it  He claimed a friend had bought it for his birthday  but didn’t have a receipt One of the store owners was working in the back  so I got him involved  The owner asked the kid a couple of questions  including when his birthday was  He then pulled up the item’s sales record to reveal we hadn’t sold any of this particular toy since well before the proposed birthday  The owner grilled the kid for a bit longer  but he nervously dodged all questions before fleeing  leaving the toy behind  I had my lunch break right after this  and spotter the kid again while walking out the mall  at the nearby grocery store’s gift wrapping station  wrapping something that looked suspiciously like one of our fancy kiddie notebooks  A few days later two young women came to the store with two plastic bags  filled to the brim with items from our toy and stationary aisles  They told us their little brother had bought all of the items without their parent’s permission and asked to return it We immediately knew the brother had to be the thieving kid  this was a small store  so we would’ve known about any kid actually purchasing all of these items  The owners got involved and broke the news to the sisters  They were shocked  but apologetic  and payed for the merchandise The next day  one of the sisters returned with their father  and EVEN MORE merchandise the kid had stolen  including a big inflatable pool    They explained that they’d confronted him  locking him in the bathroom until he confessed   and he had even been stealing money from the family The father thanked us for letting the family handle things before getting the cops involved  He said that if the kid had been caught stealing in their country of origin  they were Afghan refugees   the local shopkeepers probably wouldn’t have been so forgiving  The kid got off with a store ban  and i haven’t seen him since We were all pretty shocked by the sheer amount of stuff he’d stolen  I felt bad for his family  who seemed like they already had a lot on their plate  Here’s to hoping the kid has learned his lesson and left his thieving days behind him,2746,491
65,ozgffr,1,1,Abusive customer There has been an elderly woman shopping at the grocery store where I work since at least before the pandemic  But I dont remember her much before   She only shops in the afternoons and evenings  Sometimes she shows up more than once a day  Anyway  she is aggressive and verbally abusive to customers and staff  I dont usually deal with her as she doesnt shop my department  clothes   but I do hear her yelling at my cashier and customer service peeps  I dont know why no one has grown enough balls to deal with her once and for all     I guess they think because shes elderly she deserves a pass on her terrible behaviour  I dont know  Last week  she tried to hit a customer  This week she started stalking one of our staff members around the store  and she actually attacked her when she was on cash yesterday  The woman went behind the cash  behind the plexiglas  grabbed the cashiers mask off and started pushing her  I dont know why the staff last night didnt do anything immediately  but today  when this woman arrived at the store she was told she is no longer allowed on the property  and is permanently banned from the store  FINALLY  If it had been me  I might be looking at charges myself  because NO ONE is putting their hands on me  EVER  So fuck you lady  Dont ever come back,1319,240

70,oyz2hx,1,40,A lost wallet  no beer  and a jail bed for the night This happened a couple weeks ago   A customer  well call him Jim   who has been frequenting my for the past few weeks prior to this incident  walked in rather agitated and upset   I could tell  because the first word out of his mouth while in the entrance was a loud  F  k    I was at the register and he came right on over   He had lost his wallet and figured it might be in our store   Ill add here that the wallet wasnt actually that important  as he had cash on him  but it will have relevance later   I informed him that we hadnt seen no wallets and checked our lost in found  which we keep locked in our safe  my manager checked when I paged him    Then he made his intention clear  he would go grab some beer and I could ring him up because  I knew he was overage    Our corporate policy requires we ID everyone for alcohol and tobacco products  which I explained to him   I explained this so much I sounded like a broken record   The longer our conversation lasted the more agitated he became   Ill add here that every time I had seen him he had been polite  but was a very weird dude   Jim then became silent midway through our chat and made hand motions to  what looked like to me  putting on a seatbelt  thats when I knew he wasnt desperate  but something was very off about him    He was trying to calm himself down it appeared  and somehow hoped it would erase the previous conversation   Next thing he said was if I could sell him the beer  and a repeat of what I had already told him   Very soon my manager was involved and told him the very same thing   By this point he was fed up and telling me sob stories about how hard it was to g et there on foot  how he knew my manager from high school  they didnt know each other from Adam   throwing insults mostly at my manager and cussing loudly   These were said in a very hostile manner  as if he could snap any time   On his way out the door he started to berate a female customer  asking what she was laughing at   The two customers waiting to come to the register were standing way back  and this young lady was not laughing   Jim then asked her to buy him beer  then extended the invitation out to everyone   A mom in a nearby aisle had heard enough and decided to tell him so as he was leaving   I waved her down because the last thing we wanted was another confrontation   Fortunately he didnt even react and left   Once hes left we tried to get everything back to normal by ringing up the customers who had been waiting on Jim   He wasnt gone more than a minute or two  before he came barging back in with a vengeance  hitting our metal detector along the way and said something that I couldnt distinguish   His next words we could  something about  you have my wallet  and  take me to your lost and found   with explosives mixed in   He came right up to the counter and accused us of keeping his wallet and demanded we take him to our lost and found  because he needs his beer  remember    It was at this point my adrenaline dumped   My heart began racing and I thought the whole time I may actually find myself in an actual fight   I was just standing there  I hadnt moved  unlike my customers who got the hell away from where we were   waiting to see what he was going to do   I wholeheartedly felt  he was on the verge of violent action   Right then  a cop walked in   His demeanor changed instantly  and on the spot he made up a lie about how we had stolen his wallet or something like that   He even persisted in asking the officer to look in the lost and found with him   Within a minute this officer and his partner had him cuffed and led out  all right in front of my register   It became clear when he was being cuffed that he was intoxicated  the officer said he could smell it    I explained to the officers all that had occurred and filled out a written statement   We found out afterward  that another female customer had gone to the back of the store when he started going off the first time  prior to his second entrance  and called the cops   Had she not done that  wed have been attempting to call when he walked back in the second time  my manager had the phone in his hand and was about to while he was accusing us of stealing his wallet  and things may have likely gotten physical   I found out later that another store manager knew the guy and informed me he was a drug addict   It confirmed my suspicions that  a drunk would not be so amped and belligerent  but someone coming off a high might be   All in all  a very interesting life experience I never thought Id encounter,4642,914
71,oywxav,1,45,Sorry for attempting to make something more convenient and cheaper for you  Happened today and I’m honestly still just confused more than anything I work in wireless A customer comes in talking about a free tablet promotion we are running and says that she spoke with a care rep on the phone and they told her to just go to a store  Okay  no problem and thanks for the sale and commission  Was it that easy  Of course not  The customer doesn’t have my company as her wireless provider and was just looking for the tablet to be free  I explain that having a tablet with unlimited data on an account without a voice line makes the tablet line unnecessarily expensive and ask who her wireless provider is for her voice line  She tells me  then says she likes it because it’s only   month  Okay  yea  that’s nice and cheap  I explain that the tablet line by itself would be   month  but if she brought over her voice line and put it on the same account as her tablet line with us  combined  the account would be as low as   month for both  saving the customer   month and making it so she only has to pay  bill for both instead of  Convenient and saves money so I though the customer would be at least receptive of the idea  I was very wrong At this point she begins verbally berating me  Yelling at me and telling me that I’m being rude trying to sell her something she didn’t come in for letting me know if I continue speaking to her that way she would file a formal complaint against me… ummm  Okay  Before I could speak again  she cut me off and said she also didn’t appreciate how I was conducting myself and motioning around with my hands  I tend to be a bit animated when I talk about anything  it’s just the way I am It honestly took every ounce of willpower I had not to snap back at her with “I’m sorry my inadvertent muscle ticks make you uncomfortable”  I don’t have an actual tick  but she was being a real a hole  but being the good little retail employee I am  I just excused myself from the interaction and had my co worker finish the interaction Did we close the sale  Of course not because she felt we were attempting to swindle her and have her do something she didn’t want to do as if I was twisting her arm to bring over her voice line  I merely suggested it as a way to both save her money and make her billing be more convenient… I’m sorry for that I guess  People are wild,2421,450

73,oy8r8h,1,49,It’s my fault you walked out with something you didn’t pay for For context  I work at a general store in a residential area  In this store  our counters are pretty big  meaning if something is placed right in front of it on the floor  I can’t see it  so customers will lift large items up for me to scan  One night we’re nearing close and a couple ends up at my register with a bunch of food and I make my way from where I was cleaning to help them  They told me before I rung them up that they had a budget so I kept an eye on the total  They pay and I immediately turn my attention to the next customer in line as she’s putting her stuff on the counter While i’m checking out this customer  I notice couple from before is outside with a cooler i didn’t know they had  they’re already out the door and I thought maybe they’d brought it in  but I still had my doubts  I finish up with this customer and go back to nightly cleaning Well  woman with the cooler comes back in to buy a pack of cigarettes  I take this opportunity to nervously asked her if they had gotten that cooler from here  and I get a slightly rude “Yes ” I politely explain that I didn’t know they had a cooler and asked if she could bring it back in so I could scan it  Now she’s getting increasingly mad  explaining they loaded it up with the ice and food they just bought and that they were walking home  I ask if she can bring the tag for me to scan and she huffs and walks out the door calling “daddy” loudly to her partner  Turns out they don’t have the money for the cooler  so I call the lead key holder on duty to help me  The lady says she’ll return some of the food and pay for the cooler that way  but we explain our refunds don’t go through immediately and she would still not have enough  She ended up getting super upset at me  saying it’s my fault because I let her walk out with the cooler  I’m getting lectured by a grown woman on how I should have scanned the cooler first because they had a budget  how I allowed them to walk out so “technically” she shouldn’t have to pay for it  plus plenty of other rude comments  She half yelled “I’m a good person so I will pay for it  but I shouldn’t have to” I cried in the break room while the key holder dealt with the issue  My key holder ended up calling the store manager and the woman came in the next day to pay for it  Final thoughts  I understand her frustration  and also understand being on a budget  However I don’t understand how blaming and berating me for not ringing up an item I didn’t know they had is going to fix the problem  Everyday I have customers ask if I scanned their large item and most of the time the answer is yes  and if it’s no  they hold it up for me to scan  I’m a teenager and this is my first job  so i’m still learning  I took this pretty personally and wanted to share this and hear other people’s thoughts,2889,566
74,oy7zra,1,413,Canada doesnt have a veteran discount As far as I know  no store in Canada gives any kind of military discount  veteran or otherwise  correct me if Im wrong  fellow Canadians   We are not as military oriented as the US  Back when I worked at a big red drug store  I worked as a cash supervisor  It was my job to cover my cashiers breaks and make sure customers got as good a customer experience as possible  For those who dont know  drug stores do not sell tobacco or alcohol products so the only item we sell that requires an ID is lottery  relevant later   We also have a seniors day on Thursday where anyone   can get   off  We dont need an ID or proof of age  they usually just know to ask for it since signs are up everywhere advertising the discount This story takes place about mid   before all the COVID drama started  It was a Saturday so no managers were in I was covering my cashiers break when a man comes up with a basket full of stuff  I make the usual greetings  ask if he has our rewards card  and ask if he would like a bag  He gruffly says something about visiting from the US so of course he doesnt have a rewards card with us  He doesnt respond to wanting a bag so I just start stacking his items at the end of the till  When I finish scanning his items  I read off his total and ask if he is paying with cash or card  He tosses an ID on the counter  Me  Oh  did you want lottery Him  What  No  I want a discount  Me thinking he meant the seniors discount  Oh Im sorry we only have seniors discounts on Thursdays The customer looks at me like Im stupid  He shoves the ID closer  Him  Im a veteran  missy  That means I get a discount no matter what day it is Me  Um    Im sorry but we dont do veterans discounts here in Canada Him  Well they do where Im from so you need to honor that I stand there dumbfounded  How did that make any sense  Me  Im sorry but I have no way to put any kind of discount on your purchase  as it is not Thursday for seniors day  and we have no promo going on right now  Him getting obviously upset and red in the face  I want your supervisor  I want you fired  I want a new cashier I blink at him  I can barely get the words out as I tell him I AM the supervisor and there was no store manager in today  The man flipped his lid  He started yelling at me  telling me I was discriminating and I must hate the US and he hoped they bombed my country next and that all of Canada was a stupid place with stupid people  I just stood there not sure what to do  People were starting to stare and I was so freaked out all i could do was stand there with my mouth open going  Uhhh    Finally he said his piece and stomped out of the store with his ID and nothing else  I stood there in silence for a few minutes just trying to process what happened  My cashier came back but i had nothing else to do so I just stayed on till to help with customers A little elderly woman came up to my register to ask if I was alright and that she never liked those  hooligans south of the border   She made me smile and actually helped me put some of the items away that the man had left on the till  It makes me wonder though  does every place in the US give a discount to veterans  And why did he flip out so badly when I didnt give him one here,3330,647

79,oxuozi,1,35,No  I did not use telekinesis to ring you up  I work at a grocery store renowned for its weird flavors and friendly staff  you know the one  anyway the relevant detail is  we do not have conveyer belts at the checkout  You park the cart right next to the register and the cashier takes everything out by hand  Theres no scan gun either  I have to pick everything up This lady parks her cart and tells me she wants half her stuff separate  for a friend  Okay sure  I scan  bag  and tell her the total  Theres still the rest of her items in the cart  She pulls the cart away from me to go use the card reader  on the opposite side of my counter where I cant reach them   with all of her unpaid items in it  I think this is super weird  but maybe she has mobility issues and needs the cart for stability  Then she tries to leave without paying for half her stuff   Maam  I havent scanned the rest of your items  you said you wanted them separate   What  I just paid  I only wanted a separate bag  I already paid for those   Oh  no  sorry maam  I thought you meant you wanted two separate orders  I only scanned the ones that I bagged    Customers in the line next to me are looking at this exchange like shes lost her mind  so at least I dont feel alone I take her cart back to my side of the register and finish while she glares at me Woman really thought I somehow used telekinesis to ring her up without touching any of her stuff  just left it in there without bagging for some reason  and that all her groceries were only,1553,288
80,oxu7m7,1,13,Signs and employees say doors close at   but nope the customer read  So my grocery store has two doors on each side of the store and around   we close one door to direct traffic out one  Well there was one guy heading towards the closed door and I told him that  Well he just argued that the door says til  and therefore the door will magically open due to his worldly presence and inability to read  After some back and forth  each of us sticking to our idea of when the doors close  he eventually gave up and went to the still open door  Regardless of what he read  the doors close at  every night and there are signs before you get to the door  Now if you push hard enough  those doors will open  However I think walking though an open automatic door is easier,769,151
81,oxm1k7,1,62,Lady wants us to call cops cause someone was kind enough to pay for her order  Lady  did not want her stuff paid for  This is mostly from secondhand and a bit from trying to deal with her  First of all she ran her card  but messed up  as Ive explained US  debit is a trick question  Only pick Visa or MasterCard debit    She  rerang it and it kept declining  Gentleman behind her told the cashier that hed pay for it  NOTE  It was the customer not cashier that got the Ladys stuff paid for  At some point manager had to intervene and get the lady to leave the line as she was holding up everyone else Lady does not leave the store and just stands near the front  Manager comes  over to me to tell me her stuff is paid for and shes crazy and wont leave  After I get through my line  having to turn off my light in order to do so as its busy enough  I head over to her  She first tells me    I have no intercourse with you    In my head  Im glad I know that that probably just means no issue with you  but still  the implications   She then brings up some random to me peoples names saying from another location she remembers me    huh   WTF    Then she tells me that the cashier got the customer to pay for her and she didnt want that  She wants the police called I am not about to call the police on a good deed  Nor that the store did  nothing wrong  I go over to the cashier to make sure all is on the up and up and yeah  So  then I get on the walkie to the same manager and tell her this lady wants the police involved and it appears as if she is willing to stay here forever  Thus  we need to figure out some way of resolving this  My manager refuses to deal with it  Though  I guess ignoring her was the right call  as Lady did leave on her own as I went back to what I was doing Roughly  an hour later Lady comes back  I begrudgingly talk to her  Now she still wants the police called  She also wants us to pull up a report to make  sure her groceries were paid for  I told her we cant pull up a report     Technically  we could  but wed have to one wait until the next morning  when the lady who works with the tills is in and two wed have to work hard to figure out which order was hers and three we let her leave her stuff is paid for move on already    I was well overdue for my break  So  I leave for min  She finally leaves for the rest of the night,2387,484
82,ox8ub5,1,46,Guy tries to return underwear and doesnt understand why its unhygienic I was fortunate to not have to deal with this customer personally but was there in observation and was told all about it Returns policy context  we dont offer returns on makeup and cosmetics and most certainly we dont offer returns or exchanges swaps on underwear  The reason why we dont accept underwear returns is because its unhygienic and even if its been packaged back up and or washed  we cant just trust the customers word on that it hasnt been worn that its clean  I suppose the only circumstance we would allow a return is if we literally just served the customer  Onto the story  the customer was a middle aged guy with his two kids and he goes up to my friends till and tries to return his briefs and a t shirt   Naturally my friend explains the return policy to which he flips his switch and argues back saying  HOW IS IT UNHYGIENIC TO RETURN UNDERWEAR    Naturally of course my friend and even my supervisor had got involved at this point to explain to the man that it was unhygienic and why it was He went on to say  HOWS IT HYGIENIC TO RETURN A T SHIRT AND NOT UNDERWEAR    I mean Im kinda at a loss for words here      like seriously Even his kids got involved telling him to shutup  lol  and they even mentioned that he does this a lot so Im sure other retail staff have had the absolute pleasure to deal with this customer before Hygienically speaking  Im sure no matter how many times you wash the underwear   the bacteria and sweat and god knows what else will still be there in some form  I doubt anybody would be happy to know they purchased used underwear,1686,298
83,ox6d3m,1,12,Had to threaten to call police on customer who verbally attacked me over free food So Ill try to shorten this as much as I can  I worked in a small food store  so small that we frequently worked shifts alone in the store  The company who owned this store had a super annoying habit of doing coupons with tons of fine print and rules  Basically get people in with the coupon then upsell the hell out of them or get them away from the coupon to something else  because someone who comes in for a   deal of multiple items will definitely change their mind to pay full price for one box of potatoes 🙄   We also had to have a high ticket average and high gm  so failing to meet these rules with customers would result in bad numbers and ultimately warnings  write ups  etc  Anyway  this day a couple came in  She had a stack of various coupons  The husband left to do shopping elsewhere and I helped the wife  Of course she wanted the deal from one coupon with the free gift included PLUS the free gift from another coupon without getting anything from that coupon  Basically she met the   threshold and thought shed get the free gifts from all the coupons versus meeting the requirements from each  I explained this  She begrudgingly accepted this  though would continue to fight with me every time she picked a new item expecting the free gifts that wouldnt apply  Finally I worked it out to something acceptable for her while also following the guidelines  While checking out her husband came back in  He asks about the free burgers or whatever it was and she got snotty and said  I dont qualify  or something to that nature  He then looks to me and says  You cant just give us some free stuff for spending so much money    Just fyi    was not a lot of money here  One box of potatoes were   regular price and our ticket avg was expected to be no less than     People loved to expect free things for spending soooo much money with us  I told him I explained the rules already with his wife but that we must follow the coupon rules  He didnt like this answer  He started getting belligerent   Its just free burgers  We spent so much  Youre going to give us this free stuff   He actually came around the counter to the side and got into my face  For reference here  I am a  petite female in a store by myself with a man screaming in my face  I told him Id call the police if he didnt leave right now  Luckily I had finished ringing them up and the wife told him to go and they left  He was chuckling the whole time leaving  knowing he scared the crap out of me  He then stood outside the window for a second and laughed more and bucked at me  I called my  at the time  boyfriend and just cried  Then called my manager and we flagged his name in our system  And thats my worst customer service story,2825,530

86,owyuiq,1,84,are you open   were clearly not This happened to me about a week ago A bit of context for the store I work at  when we are closed  there are metal shutters that cover all the doors and windows  To get into the building to open in the mornings  we open the shutters for the exit door  which has no handle on the outside  which is fine  since its an exit door  We open at am This fateful day Im on the opening shift  so Im hanging out with my manager in the office before we open the shutters  when at  am  I remember that specifically  we hear the buzzer that goes off whenever someone opens either the entrance or the exit door  My manager and I look at each other  because neither of us are expecting anyone else to be there yet  Then a man comes into the store Now remember  every other shutter is closed  and the exit door has no handle on the outside  meaning he literally had to pry his way into the store As he walks in he shouts  hello   I step out of the office  look at him  and say  hi   He then asks  are you guys open yet   It took me a moment to be able to respond  wondering how he could possibly think were open  but then tell him not for a few more minutes  He says okay and walks back out He came back in  through the entrance door this time  as soon as we were open and bought his stuff  When he left he forgot his phone on the counter  so he came back a few minutes later  and came in through the exit door AGAIN  despite having already gone through the entrance door once already,1522,291
87,ows16v,1,10,Lady Thinks Competitor Flyer is Our Flyer  I just remembered this story  This happened  years ago this month  I was in my final two weeks with this retail job  I was sick and tired of the manager and the owner of the store  And funny enough  I was moving onto their competitor that is involved in this story  So I had this women walk up to me  handing me a cut out of a flyer  with a heater  asking where this item was  I could tell it wasn’t ours  but the competitors  So I told her it wasn’t our flyer  and the cut out was from a flyer from our competitor  She was rather snarky  saying  “Yes it is your flyer  I cut it out of your flyer  Not your competitor  Where is the heater ” I pulled out a copy of my stores flyer I kept in my back pocket  put it next to her cut out and said “No  it’s from the competitor  Our flyer as you can see has a glossy coating  Your cut out doesn’t  Also  these aren’t our product numbers  and the brand of the heater doesn’t belong to us  You can also see how are product numbers are different compared to theirs ”The women looked at the flyer and the cut out  She said nothing  just grabbed her cutout and walked away,1166,227

90,owm6ey,1,2,Most annoying customer    Hi Reddit I’m back again with another story about a customer that was easily the worst customer I’ve ever served in my  years of working period  and that’s saying a lot  In case you’re new here I’m a supervisor for a bulk food store I’m  and a girl that’s all you really need to know  this lady came in and seemed nice at first saying she needed a certain amount of spices all of them HAD to equal   now we price things according to the weight and it’s really hard to get   of parsley flakes when they’re   per pound so needless to say she got a lot and I kept checking the prices of everything  which we don’t have to do but it was better than dusting Anyways the total comes up to exactly   and she hands me the   then takes the   back and asks me to break her   I call up my Assistant Manager for good measure and set the extra   aside all the while the customer is now being impatient as anything and says “that’s mine  hand it to me  I’m in a rush” and my Assistant Manager says it’s ok and I give her the money this is where it should end but no as I’m dusting I got into my own head  dangerous i know  thinking ‘oh no she only paid   for a   order  I’m not getting fired for accidentally embezzling money’ so I pay  End of the night happens we’re over   on my till and I internally cry because I’m happy that I didn’t fuck up and get my money back,1411,280

93,ow5ghe,1,74,Paying with gift cards that won’t expire  gt  one time   off entire purchase So I work at this popular clothing store at my local mall  and today there was one interesting transaction I came across  and for clarity this originally wasn’t a transaction I was dealing with  but towards the end I had to step in It was closing so all of the last customers in the store were making their purchases  One of my coworkers was ringing up these three ladies who were together  and he was able to open a store credit card for one of them  which is always great for us  Where I work  if you apply for the credit card and get approved you get   off your entire purchase one time  but you have to use the credit card you just opened  you get a temporary shopping pass before the card arrives in the mail   and if you don’t get approved you get   off for trying  Here’s where it got complicated  these ladies specifically came in to use these gift cards they had  and despite getting approved for the store credit card which granted them   off their entire purchase  they were deadest on paying with the gift cards rather than using their temporary shopping pass and getting   off  One of my managers was at the register counting cash and closing registers  and she had to step in and explain that the   off is a one time thing that will go on the store credit card and how gift cards don’t expire  and can be used online  They still didn’t want to use the temporary shopping pass as they initially came to the store to use the gift cards  There was some back and forth between my manager and the ladies  so my manager had me and other associates step away from the registers for some time My manager got fed up and let them use their gift cards rather than take advantage of the one time   off  She dumped the contents of their shopping bags on the counter and had me ring up all their items again because the transaction had to be redone  After ringing up everything their gift cards weren’t scanning  so I had to put BOTH of them in manually  Both had   in them so they just paid the difference  They thanked me for my patience and left Later I mentioned to my manager that I noticed she was frustrated with them  and she stated that she was in fact frustrated as they were doing too much  especially during closing  literally what she said   Personally  I agree with my manager on this as they could’ve use the gift cards ANYTIME  and they passed up on a one time offer of   off an entire purchase just to get their gift cards  that will never expire  out the way,2582,481
94,ow3u09,1,10,Messed up super bad on cash register and am freaking out  Hi guys  so I just got off work and I did let a manager know what happened but I’m still freaking out about it and need someone’s advice So I was ringing up a customer and they bought some clothes that totaled to about   and paid in cash with changed owed  I accidentally hit cash right away instead of typing in the number first  stupid mistake  I know  and so it said “issue    change” which obviously wasn’t correct  I stupidly just closed the cash drawer and decided to just do the transaction again even though that one already went through and the receipt printed out  So I did the transaction the correct way the second time The problem is  that first transaction still went through but I closed the cash drawer and didn’t put any money in it  Does that make sense So that means now that register will be about   short  I’m freaking out now that I’m gonna get in trouble and get fired or that it’ll look like I stole    they have cameras though so if worst comes to worst they’ll see that I didn’t steal Like I said  I let a manager know and she said she’ll figure it out but I’m still really worried and also mad at myself for making such a stupid mistake What happens if a register comes up   short,1291,238
95,ovu3mx,1,80,Customer Orders Something  Doesn’t Give Gate Code To Get Into Where She Lives  So this happened Friday  Both funny and annoying  I work in a retail business that sells lumber  My job is mostly just deliveries  I had to deliveries loaded onto my truck  The second delivery was for in a town that we very rarely deliver too due to distance  which was over a hour drive away  But it was decided since I was   of the way there with my first delivery  I’d drop off the item  The customer was called by staff in the store to let them know I was coming that morning as far as I’m aware  The item was a roll of plastic  feet long  but light  I finish my first delivery  and try punching in the address for the second in my gps  There were some issues with the location because the road names weren’t matching on the gps with what my order form said  I give the customer a call to confirm the address  but all I get is a voicemail  So I leave her a message  saying I’m on my way  but to call me back so I can confirm where they were  I drive to where the gps took me  and there was no road or house number that matched  I try calling the customer again  no answer  So try googling the street in my phone  and a result came up for a little retirement trailer park on the north end of town  and I was on the south end  After fighting through traffic for over  minutes  I arrive  I recognized the park right away  This place required a gate code to get in  This gate is only meant for stopping vehicles  There were sidewalks on either side  I call the customer again  no answer  So I call the administration for the park  and explain the situation  They said if I type the customers house number into the keypad  it will call down to their unit and they have a override  But if the customer didn’t answer  I unfortunately can’t get in So I tried the keypad  nothing happened  I look up a map  to see where her unit is  and it was about half a mile from the front gate  I call down to my store  and talk to the worker who did the order  They were pissed with the customer  saying “Her telling us there is a gate would be very helpful to know ” She tells me she’ll try phoning  and to hold tight  After  minutes  I get a call back from my coworker  saying she can’t get a hold of the customer either  And she didn’t want to have me not deliver the item since it would be a long drive back  So she told me if I could walk to her unit  let her know I am there  I can walk back  and get my truck to deliver her item  As I prepare  I figured I might as well bring the item with me  It wasn’t heavy  and it would save going through the park twice  After  minutes of walking  I arrive  and peer into the back yard  and see the customer working  I call out  informing who I am  And I was pretty blunt in saying we had called multiple times  because we didn’t have any code to get through the gate  She asked me how I managed to get here  and I told her I walked with her item  She immediately started saying how sorry she was  How embarrassed she was  just saying sorry again and again and again  I just simply said “If you order anything more in the future  just remember to give us the gate code ” She kept saying how sorry she was  and told me to wait  I realized she was getting me a tip  so after a moment  she came back  giving me a five dollar bill  I know kinda bad to think  but I thought “I walked a half mile with a large roll of plastic and you give  dollars ” I just kept polite and said thank you  and walked back to my vehicle with her saying how sorry she was  So on my walk back  I phone my coworker  let them know what went on  and they told me when they phone the customer later  they’ll be charging her a larger delivery charge considering what I had to do  This delivery probably took closer to a hour longer then it would have under normal circumstances  So that was my fun  I had to drive back and have a short lunch because I had at least  more deliveries to try and complete before the end of the day,4044,795
96,ovsl84,1,11,Listening to failed robberies unravel over a radio  So  I started a retail job at a store that had just opened up in my city a couple months ago  and I have been waiting for the day to finally tell a fun tale  I have had a couple of run ins with lowkey  Karens  for instance  on the stores opening day  I had a Karen ask me where the business shirts are  I showed her  and she said she wanted a  pack of business shirts  I apologised and said that we didnt have  packs of business shirts  and she huffed and said  You work here and dont know where anything is   before walking off     uhh yeah  its everyones first day  of course were not going to know everything  lol  amp  xB But I digress  the story that this post is referring to just happened on my shift that I just got off of a couple hours before writing this post  for this story to make sense  our store has these  Push to Talk  devices  Im unsure how many other retail stores do this  but Im guessing its commonplace   basically walkie talkies that are fed through an ear piece The first encounter of the day happened about  minutes into my shift  I hear over the radio from a co worker   Hi  a customer just came up to me saying that they saw someone shoplifting and that theyre still in the store  This obviously got my attention  since working the checkouts  there isnt a lot of insane action that goes on other than the odd peak time here and there  I then hear the Manager ask for the description of the culprits and what they were stealing  a bald man with a hat and a green jacket with a partner was stealing kitchen knives by replacing the new ones in boxes on the shelves with crap ones My interest is peaked even more when they said that they had spotted the culprits  and I then hear over the radio   Okay  Ill call security  make sure you check their bags before they leave While this is happening Im fixing up a Click and Collect order for another customer  and when I come back out to the registers and hand the customer their items  theres two security guards and all the managers double checking everything they were buying They ended up being let go  so my guess is that they realised they were caught trying to steal and decided to bail on that idea and just buy the items instead  and I thought that was the end of the excitement for the night  amp  xB But then it happened again  not even an hour after the first event  Im back at the registers  and I hear the manager come on the radio and say  Hi everyone on level   I would like you to keep an eye on a young blonde woman  shes wearing a grey jumper  and is acting really dodgy  just a heads up  me and my co workers at the checkouts all give eachother a look  wondering whats going on  then about  minutes later we hear   Definitely keep an eye out for her  shes definitely stealing stuff  at this point Im kind of chuckling  cause again  this is quite a lot of excitement for someone who stands behind a register for a good majority of the shift  We then hear   Shes heading to the elevators  can someone on the ground floor by the back exit just stand by the elevator near mens  we just want to have a good idea of where she is  and as this is being said  I see a manager running towards the set of escalators in the store And the radio chatter continues   Shes heading towards the beauty section  can we get someone over there   Can someone call security   Security went home because they were sick  Of course they did  Make sure she doesnt get near the exits  Shes just got on the elevator Im keeping watch by the elevator kind of looking around  not really sure what to do at this point  just kind of thinking  What the fuck is going on    only to then hear over the radio  Shes gone into the basement   which made me chuckle again because the basement level hasnt been finished in our store yet  and is obviously a dead end The rest of what happened was told to me by the manager who caught her  he chased her into the basement and into a corner where he started taking pictures of her  Im guessing for the police so they know her appearance  and she immediately started freaking out and crying  after this she yelled  Ive got nothing left to lose   and charged at the manager which obviously got him to back off real fast  and she then managed to get out of the store empty handed we scanned all of the goods she had picked up  and determined that she nearly stole  dollars worth of goods  including a small TV Monitor  Lego Sets  clothes  etc In the end we kind of all came to the conclusion that it was likely a junkie trying to steal stuff from our store so she could sell it on Facebook Marketplace or Ebay to make a quick buck  the next half hour over the radio was them just describing the security camera footage  like the moment she realised she was caught  how desperately she was trying to get away  how funny it was seeing the managers chasing her around  so on Part of me wants to feel bad for the thief because it definitely sounded like she was in a really rough place what with how the manager described her reaction to getting caught stealing so much  but at the same time  I cant help but feel like she was likely going to sell that stuff to get another hit of ice or something   But I guess the thing I got out of this is that there are quite a lot of eyes on you in Retail stores  even if it may not seem like it  Anyway  just thought Id share that experience with you guys  was quite an exciting night for me  TL DR   a couple got caught trying to steal knives  had security called on them and ended up paying for them anyway  and a woman tried stealing  dollars worth of merchandise  was chased around the store for  minutes before leaving empty handed,5792,1065

99,ovo66x,1,2,Asking for ID brings out the worst in some people Ive been working at a gas station in Idaho for almost a year and a half  and I have plenty of stories to tell from my work past  Im not sure why but asking ID from people has a   chance of them either complying with you or try to make a snarky comment on why you have to ID them  Like any gas stations or retail establishments we have beer doors and a beer cooler that you must be at least  or older to enter or grab one  On the very front of our entrance we have a big ol sign that states we will ID you for items such as cigarettes and alcohol  on the beer cooler door we have another sign that you must be   to enter and our glass mirror by our registers have a big sign saying we will ID you  We have to pay attention to the people who come in pairs or in groups  for example if you stay outside of the beer cooler or dont have any alcohol on you we wont ID you if only one of you guys goes in but the others stays out  But if your whole group of six people all go to the beer cooler or grab any alcohol we will ID your entire group  If one of you dont have an ID or if one of you guys has an expired license  we wont sell the entire group anything  Once you start coming in more often in my gas station and I ID you more  I wont ID you if you become a regular at our store  So here we are working a swing shift with my other cashier co worker taking a break  when a group of four people happily greet me and head towards the beer cooler   They seem cool and nice at first  a group of what I assumed were college kids just getting a couple brewskies to drink  All four of them grab something and stand behind two people in line  I helped an old lady with gas and a regular grabbing his smokes he always gets  Now its time for the group of four consisting of three chicks and a guy  All of four them put their six pack of beer and cases on the counter as I start to ring em up  I tell them hows their day going the usual stuff making small talk with the customers  all seem happy telling me they were heading to a party  Cool beans  the ladies stand behind the guy who had his ID ready for me and was about to pull his credit card out  I thanked the guy for showing me his ID without me telling him and I asked if everybody else has their ID on them  They told me he was the one paying so they dont have to show me  the guy stated the same thing as the ladies did and told me they dont have to  I assured them they did have to show me their ID as they went into an area only meant for people who are    They reassured me they didnt have to since he was the one paying  I can start noticing one of the the chicks getting annoyed by me and rolling her eyes as I state once again I do have to see of all their IDs in order to complete to purchase  The guy in the group suddenly wants to go all macho man on me and says  whatever they dont need their ID  and inserts his credit card into my card reader  Me started to get a little flustered tell them all I have to do is hit complete sale and finish this transaction since I already have your credit card information on my system but just please show me your IDs ladies  They tell me I didnt ID the guy in front of them who bought cigarettes and told me he looks younger then them  I once again reassured them I ID him the first time I saw him and multiple times after that  I told them hes a regular who buys the same cigarettes and lotto tickets once or twice a day  The thing they did next kinda made me laugh and caught me off guard  Chick   in the group says fuck you and tries to complete their purchase on our self checkout machines  Funny enough they need my badge barcode to verify theyre   So here we are a bunch of college looking adults standing in a hissy fit because I wont sell them beer  Finally after  minutes of dealing with them  chick   says I dont have my ID and chick   has her ID but its expired  Oh boy I just tell them Im not selling you any of you guys beer  They all flip me off and called me a fucking loser  as they tell each other to head to another gas station  Oh wells  luckily for me they were the only customers at the store during that time and I just go ahead and put their stuff back where it went and continued my evening shift,4304,880
100,ovk8w1,1,8,Got called a b tch at my new job for the first time i would first like to say that i’m new to reddit and this sub so if there’s anything that’s probably not in the ordinary it’s because i’m not very good at using this site  so i started working as a cashier two weeks ago and for the most part i’ve been pretty good at the job considering i have never worked in my entire life  i’m  btw   i was also having a pretty good day yesterday too because i finally was able to hold a conversation with a coworker without being awkward as hell lol  anyways yesterday is where everything starts  it was like  pm and i leave at like   so one of my senior coworkers told me to shut off my light because i would be leaving soon and she didn’t want me to suddenly have a huge line to deal with  i only had two customers left  i was already ringing one of them up and at the time  i didn’t notice the other customer that was in line  i finished ringing up the first customer and then thats when i noticed my next customer which was a little girl  i was about to also ring her up because she came in line before i shut off my light  However  my bagger told me “what are you doing  we’re done”  i shouldn’t have listened to him tbh because he was also new  anyways i told the little girl that this lane was closed  and she was going to have to go to the next line  she responded saying “well my mom is going to be frustrated”  i laughed it off not knowing the mom would be MORE than frustrated  ’  a minute or so later as i was about to leave  the mom came up and spoke in an already annoyed tone saying “where’s the lady before me  ”  she was asking for the previous customer which idky  and i proceeded to tell her that the lane was closed  she then yelled saying “i was already in line when the light was on and now you telling me we can’t do it here  ”  it was my first time interacting w a mad customer so i panicked and just repeated that the lane was closed  and thats when she said “man whatever you bitch”  ’  she then went to my senior coworker who was ringing up her items and proceeded to rant to her about me and kept saying “SHE KNEW TOO I WAS THERE  SHE KNEW” which i genuinely did not know until my first customer was done  but it just bugged me when my coworker kept telling her “i’m sorry about that”  i already felt like that whole situation was my fault and the sorrys confirmed it for me  ’  this honeslty isn’t that big of a deal  it’s just been bothering me all day yesterday and today  i have a really hard time socializing and this job was helping me a lot  but this one small situation felt like i been set back  i just want to ask  do you guys think this was my fault  i feel like it partly is  but at the same time i felt like she was being unreasonable  considering by the time she went to the other cashier  her items were already being rung up  so she wasn’t really wasting any time  but yeah idk  just wanted to spill all of this somewhere and didn’t know where  i really hope this was the right sub to go to lol,3046,602

102,ouvngl,1,46,The vodka must glow because  Chernobyl So a tiny bit of context first  I have been working for a major wine liquor store for about a year and a half and primarily deal with wine  but do work with other liquors too  This actually only happened about  hours ago so I’m still trying to process this interaction  I did not take part in the actual interaction but was witness about  feet away for the event  So I came around the corner from our receiving room to find one of my assistant managers helping a couple of customers  They apparently are looking for vodka and my manager recommends one of our best vodkas that isn’t particularly well known and mentions that she’s had it before and that it’s very smooth  The customer then asked where it came from  and my manager tells them it’s from Ukraine  Now this triggers a really strange physical response  as if they were recoiling in fear  They then say that they won’t get anything from Ukraine  Now this is certainly a bit strange but customers do and believe weird things sometimes  My manager just sort of shrugs it off at first and just tells them that it’s really smooth and that she thinks they’d enjoy it  This triggers one of the couple to suddenly launch into a passionate  or  minute rant about Chernobyl  He goes on to say that he knows all about the Chernobyl disaster  which mind you happened in   and that it’s still burning and spewing radiation that that the cloud covered everything  He mentions that he knows that the famed elephant foot in the plant is going to burn for  in his words  fifty thousand years and that he is not going to even touch anything from Ukraine because he knows it’s all radioactive and that it’s irresponsible for us to keep it in our store  This leaves both me and my manager completely speechless  I mean how do you respond to that  The customers just sorta march off as if they’d won some great victory in an argument with us  I was totally speechless for a few minutes after because  do people seriously think that the this is still such an active problem in day to day life even now I know that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is an ongoing issue in Ukraine and that they are still trying to figure out what to do with it  But the radiation isn’t near as widespread as it was in the first days after the disaster but these people seemed to genuinely believe that the entire country of Ukraine is an irradiated wasteland and that anything from there is inherently deadly or toxic to human life,2504,456
103,outau8,1,83,Your local discounter is not a dating site I was on register duty today but it was slow so I was in the aisles tidying up  I like to regularly peek into the aisle leading to the register to not keep a customer waiting which was when I saw a woman put an enormous amount of batteries into our battery return box  a shopping basket next to her on the table  So I walked over and asked her whether shes already been served by my coworker and if I can take her basket off of her  She explained she just grabbed it and is disposing of her batteries before going through the shop  So I just lingered by the registers for a bit and had some water when a man came through the store and approached the lady  He introduced himself as  Mike  and asked her if shes single  She looked over to me  then back to him  then went  No   in a very matter of fact tone to which he responded  oh  ok   put his shopping basket away and left the store The poor lady and I could only stare at each other in confusion,998,195

105,oulyla,1,4,I am apparently a crook and a liar This happened a few months ago now  but it will probably be one of the more memorable interactions for years to come  There will also be a tl dr at the bottom  I am apparently long winded  amp  xB I work in a decently sized liquor store  and the other day during a woman came in  I saw her and asked if she needed any help  and she said that one of my co workers had actually just helped her  I said great  and to let me know if she needed any help or had any questions  Same woman was hanging around my area so after another  minutes I asked her if she was still doing alright and she said she was doing fine  A couple more minutes pass and she is leaving my area and I just triple checked  and asked if she found what she was looking for  The woman said yup  and went on her way towards the front   amp  xB Here is where the story starts takes a turn  A different co worker paged back to me and was asking about the price of a bottle that the woman had picked up  I told my co worker the price      and they informed me she thinks that she saw the price for     I told my co worker to let me look around and Id be up in a second   amp  xB I went and checked the shelf tag  it was the correct price  I went to check the display tag  it was the correct price  Last place to check was a large display table and I found the bottle Karen picked up  next to another bottle that had a tag for     I picked up both bottles as I found them and walked them up front  I politely explained that the bottles were sitting right next to each other and that while the tag for her bottle was missing  the other bottle was labelled correctly  and that we would not be selling her the bottle she wanted for      amp  xB As I am explaining this to her she starts muttering under her breath that she knew she should have taken a picture of the bottles  or that she should have brought the bottle with the tag up  I told her Im sorry  if the bottles would have been labelled incorrectly we would have matched the price  but that was not the case  She then states that she doesnt want the bottle and I say that is fair  so I take the bottle and put it back on the table   amp  xB This woman then proceeds to hang around the store after her purchase  and eventually talks to a manager about how I must have switched the tags around so we would not give her the price she saw  My manager then asked her if she knew what bottle it was  or what I looked like  or what the price was supposed to be  Conveniently she didnt know the answers to any of those   HOWEVER  in her  star google review she at least knew what I was wearing and that it must be nice to watch the Olympics all day  and that she cannot believe I still have a job with the terrible customer service I gave her  tl dr A woman called me a crook and a liar because we wouldnt just take her word that the price was wrong  and that I must have switched some tags around,3003,578

112,ot5xfm,1,0,My first truly INSANE customer TW  Lots of Racism  Homophobia  violence and probably moreHey everyone this is my first post so I apologize in advance if I mess up with how its made or whatever but this is something I just really had to share  Buckle up it’s going to be a long and crazy road ahead  This whole story sounds fake but trust me its not I wish it was because I feel terrible even parroting what he said I bit of background for this story is that I work as the yard man for a popular Canadian farm garden hardware supply store so I am NOT used to stuff like this  I was a farm kid and don’t spend as much time with customers as other staff so needless to say my customer service skills are not   I say stuff as it is so that probably made this situation much worse Also this customer was probably   lbs and   ’ when i’m muscular  ’” and lbs  just so you guys can picture him yelling LOL  Important names  not our actual names crazy customer   “Kevin”Me   “rob”I had a customer come in today that was a lot more lets say talkative and open than the regular person should be  Right off the bat I could tell they were a serious a   interrupting  questioning everything  making fun of people and just being an overall terrible customer  He began by asking where our hardware cloth was I told him where but followed up with “which type are you looking for  because we are sold out of sizes ”x ”  ”x ”…” he just blew up  Saying what the F  K did I ask what types you don’t have  DID I  NO  I was asking where they are  So I tell him where they are and he waddles over I thought that would be the end of that  i was not that lucky  got a frantic radio call from a cashier lets call her “Morgan” saying “”Bob” please come up to cash when ASAP I have a customer looking for something and saying you sent him to the wrong place” all the while you can hear “Kevin” yelling in the background  I go up  once he sees me he hobbles over and points his mini sausage finger to my face saying “You Lying FA  OT  Im not homosexual so TF is that about  YOU SAID THERE WERE LOTS OVER THERE ” I did not I even said we are probably out before  After listening to him hurl every swear a  year old would know I somehow managed to calm him down and have him come outside so we could look together  Sure enough we had none of the right hardware cloth  he said some more choice words than retreated back to the door  on his way he noticed a  gallon stock trough and decided the price was the same as the  gallon trough  spots to the right  After more yelling he calmed down and started oversharing about his beliefs like how masks don’t work  people are sheep if they use them and spouted off about pointless numbers and graphs that don’t mean anything  This is the funny part he began talking about how people are being mind controlled by the government and how the government is run by   amp    ’s  Awful racial slur used to discriminate against Chinese people  and how our   amp     overlords are controlling and watching all of the people   He said something about assassinating Justin Tredeua and deporting all non white people and killing all Muslims before they kill us  He also said lots about homosexuals being exterminated and going to hell  “Kevin” loved saying how he is very smart actually double the average IQ of people like me  Even though he was that smart he couldn’t figure out how to use a computer  He was angry the store used security cameras because he didn’t consent to being recorded EXHALE… I think that is itFYI this was not in the correct order once he began being racist  homophobic and violent I told him to get out of the store and if he didn’t i would call the cops  He went coward mode and left thankfully Can someone please tell me if anything like this has happened to them because i have never experienced anything half as bad as this here it didn’t seem real,3928,728
113,osyhgu,1,56,My first unreasonable customer  I started working retail a little over three years ago as a side job to my long time factory job  Im divorced and the kids are grown so I was bored and applied when a new store came to town and they hired me  big surprise to me  but Im older and responsible so they work with me on the hours and it works out       Ive actually been having a pretty good time with it since its so different from my full time job and I really wondered about the horror stories people tell about the horrible customers they encounter until about a month ago      I was working the register when an older gentleman comes in and starts raising hell about something  Im occupied and there was a new boss talking to him so I wasnt paying much attention  The new boss is a younger girl and shes a real sweetie and I dont think she deals with things like that well so this guy is just reaming her       One of our services is filling propane tanks  like you use on a grill  and I guess this guy is missing an O ring to his tank  He is saying we are responsible for maintaining the tanks and we need to take care of this problem for him  New boss is trying to help him but she screwed up at first and told him we dont maintain the tanks and that wasnt what he wanted to hear so hes on a rant  a rant like I havent heard out of a customer       I finish with a customer and have a bit of time so I walk over and catch up with what is going on just as hes talking about our responsibility to maintain his tank again so I step in and tell him we fill the tanks and that is it  I tell him we dont have parts  training or any kind of tools to work on tanks  He isnt having it and seems even more angry that Im arguing with him and keeps repeating himself about our responsibilities so I ask if the gas station where he fills his car is responsible for maintaining it which pushes him further over the edge but he just keeps repeating the same thing over and over like it didnt matter what we said  if it wasnt what he wanted to hear he wasnt going to acknowledge it       I finally just told him he needed to leave and he told me wouldnt be back  I dont recall ever seeing him there before so I doubt hell be missed but now I know what its like to have an unreasonable customer,2307,475

115,osfs91,1,70,in overage charges and it’s allegedly my fault   Sorry for formatting  on mobile So a bit of background  I work for a retailer that provides mobile service There are  major characters to this story  me  OP   coworker  CW   angry lady  AL   angry lady’s mom  AM So earlier today  I have a customer  AL  that comes in angry and upset and I ask how I can help them  She begins to give me a very lengthy explanation about how she signed up for our mobile services from CW and had racked up    in charges for a shared plan on her mother’s  AM  account  She begins to tell me about how her mother  AM  is on fixed income and how she can’t afford it and she’s going through a lot in life right now  So I express my sympathy and attempt to help her out  just walking into the situation  This is where it gets interesting Every time I would try to read off what is on my computer system or billing ledger for her  she would interrupt me and go on a tirade about how that’s not what she signed up for  or how the billing is incorrect As it turns out  the person berating me  AL  was the one who racked up all the charges  And when I tell her that  she explains to me that her some has autism and uses the phone non stop  Not a problem  but it still doesn’t resolve the fact that she was the one who went over  She then tells me that all of her phones on that plan should have been unlimited  I called up CW who helped them and he confirmed they signed up for a shared plan to which she  AL  profusely refused and told me it was supposed to be unlimited when in fact  my coworker had told me they insisted on the shared plan  She switched to unlimited but the charges remained because it was from a past billing statement  She demands I refund her  which I have legit no authority to do so especially for a    credit   so I email my supervisors and regional managers about what I should do At that point all I could do was send an email and provide her some phone numbers to get her pointed in the right direction  By this point AL was calmer and apologetic and thanked me for helping her Not  minutes later  she  AL  comes back in and interrupts me while I’m helping other customers and berates me in front of other customers and shouts at me that they will not refund her  So she forcefully puts her phone into my hands and has me speak to the phone rep and they explain to me it was a legitimate charge because they cannot refund her  So  shes shouting at me while I’m talking to this phone rep  and before I can get more information from this rep  she snatched her phone out of my hands and said “fuck this  fuck all of you  we’re going to the bank and cancelling the charges and switching carriers” and abruptly leaves  The only person I felt honestly bad for was the mom  And apparently she was more upset than AL  TL DR  was thrown into a situation I had no hand in  angry lady comes in racking up    charges in overages  demands I refund her  I can’t  Comes back to berate me more and basically tells me to go fuck myself,3071,579

117,orvpcn,1,181,Working with a “No Return Refund” policy… My coworkers and I suffered so much abuse because of the store’s No Return policy  For context  it was a Beach Shop in a really popular tourist destination  The policy existed because people on vacation would buy everything they needed  then return it all at the end of their stay  It was also a health safety issue because people often tried to return their worn or broken bathing suits  I’m not exaggerating—  times  the bottoms presented to me would have skid marks in them  I kept disinfectant spray at my counter because of it  To deter this  my boss put up giant signs  everywhere  that said “No Returns Refunds ” followed up with the details  all this was in place years before I started working there   Employees were required to repeat it before every transaction and it was printed on every receipt  Despite this  people would still come back determined to get a refund  Once  a lady had a full on meltdown because she couldn’t return her ripped up bathing suit top  She was crying  screaming  shaking  and chased my boss around the store with it  I had to call the police for them to make her leave Another time  a grown man chucked their beach chair at my ’ female coworker Regardless of how people feel about the policy  the store absolutely was within their rights to enforce it  No one tricked the customers either—it’s actually embarrassing how in your face we had to be about the policy  So why did customers still try to return things then go crazy when they couldn’t,1541,263
118,ort6xw,1,0,The day where everything happened so much I work at a store known locally in my area for being pretty chaotic  and while its usually much calmer after covid upset the atmosphere and allowed us to get the store under control  we still have a lot of  what the fuck  events that occur on the regular  Most of them are related to shoplifters or customers that get brainworms when they walk through the door and forget how normal human beings are supposed to act  One day in particular  However  I was working a long shift at the fitting room  and it was the strangest one on record so far First thing I see when I walk in is the coworker Im replacing  looking uneasy  I expect her to warn me that theres a trouble customer  and in  a way  she does    A customer has been in one of the fitting rooms for an hour  I take her place  and both of my managers appear  one of them hanging out with me and the other inspecting the fitting rooms  It was busy when I showed up  but soon enough  theres nobody else in the fitting room but her  and while wandering manager is nearby  the woman inside peeks out  then immediately locks the door as WM approaches  Another hour passes  We occasionally hear clicking  probably from her trying to defeat the hard tags on the clothes shes undoubtedly trying to steal  Eventually  One of the managers knocks on the door  and tells her she needs to leave  She comes out begrudgingly  claiming that she fell asleep  leaving the clothes she was trying on  two have the price tags ripped off  one has a hole where the hard tag was violently ripped out  shes left HER OWN sweatshirt in with the mix  and one of the items she went in with is missing  I think peace has returned to the fitting room  Managers scatter  and we start going about our normal business  One of my coworkers comes to clean the bathrooms  which are about ten feet away from where I have to stand all day  Not even fifteen quiet  incredibly normal minutes later  another coworker comes to throw something away and finds a number of very bloody paper towels in the trash by the bathrooms  I check in one of the bathrooms  and find even more  Theres so much blood  The bathrooms are locked with a pin pad  anyone I let in has to walk by me to leave  and my racks and caddies and such are placed so that Im usually facing the bathrooms when Im working on things    And yet neither I  nor any of my coworkers constantly coming and going  noticed any event that would have caused blood  much less cleaned up blood ending up in the trash OUTSIDE the bathroom in plain sight  I can only guess that one of the people I let in predicted and quickly dealt with a nosebleed  but    why put some of the cleanup outside  And so much  I just dont get it Finally  as if fate knew that I felt safe  my manager finds the shirt  He picks up  a shirt that someone has abandoned where it doesnt belong  and as the resident wrangler of textile goods  he brings it to me  He hands it to me  I grab it It is wet I Immediately say    Manager    what the hell   and hes obviously concerned  as thats an unusual reaction for a fitting room attendant to have when being given a shirt  Upon inspection  its soaked around the hard tag  so soaked in fact that the price tag is completely dissolved and mostly gone  He takes it  and I forget about the incident after washing away the memories with hand sanitizer  Later  though  as Im going on my last break  I get up to the front to do my walk and a bunch of employees and the managers are there  chatting about the lady from earlier  After a little chatter  I ask my manager if he found out why the shirt was wet  He explained that he had checked the cameras  and found that the shirt had been abandoned by a family    with small children Basically  a child sucked the price tag right off a shirt It almost made up for how agonizingly boring my next shift was,3904,721

129,oqkj06,1,12,Thats not good enough   Its store policy to leave  non purse  bags and other stores shopping upfront so there is less chance for you to slip something in them and steal  We have cameras but honestly if you place them in various places we allow  noone steals your item  Granted a lot of people still bring big enough bags  but it seems like they are purses or for their babies and other stores shopping w o a care in the world  We only find out about it when they are checking out Granted this customer did not know the cashier was new  but still she hadnt been taught this fully yet He leaves under   worth of a Dollar store worth of items on her till where customers bag there stuff  Granted  its in a yellow bag vs our white bags  Still  somehow by the time he comes back from shopping in our store  its gone  We try and locate it  maybe one of us moved it to where it belongs   NOPE  Then  I was told to come and talk  I wasnt even in the area yet   I had first thought it was him shopping again at our store aka forgot a few things  Asked for a receipt and he tells me yeah I have it and shows me the dollar store receipt along with telling me I left this up here so you know I didnt steal  After I got up to speed  I tell him sorry nothing we can do  Shes new and will be taught now how to handle these requests Thats not good enough  I tell him  OK Ill contact my manager and see what they say  She tells me to say all we can do is have you come back in the morning and look at the cameras Thats not good enough  I then point my manager out to him so he can talk to her himself  She comes closer and tells me again  I think since he was clearly more English and She is more Spanish wants me to be translator  I tell him that again Whats her name  You arent doing your jobs We repeat we are sorry  and then we move back away  I reopen my till  lines were getting busy   He leaves after he sees weve now ignored him We are not responsible for keeping track of your items  That said  like I said above  we dont have an issue  provided you keep it away from people in a rush to get home  Also  I know people are in different situations  but   of   store items  should not be  Not good enough  lets cause a scene over it,2262,440
130,oqjm7x,1,4,Customer  Its not my problem  NOTE  I did not check to be   sure  but Im quite sure its pretty obvious that even if true customer still was in the wrong and should have known that was the case The workers at the Bakery try to leave at pm  store closes at pm   they might be there cleaning and still willing to create an order for you  but basically  save for mass manufactured baked goods and the  pack of min bollios singles and regular sized bollios as well  there is no more to be gotten In particular  we have various Mexican doughnuts cookies cakes etc on trays you see at bakeries  which are behind glass doors  which if they did their job right have a  plastic  bag covering over them  Which makes it beyond obvious that they arent accessible right now  I cant vouch if we have a sign up  but as established customers dont read  Its very close to pm  I see this guy has  cupcakes and  half gallon of milk  Quick side note  I counted them  he initially was trying to get me to agree to   Then he  jokingly  said     I now am saying no theres   Also  you shouldnt have these as these are inaccessible right now after pm  He says not my problem  I just diffuse the situation by agreeing and saying that I will make sure they are reminded I was in the area just a few minutes earlier and had to tell a couple sorry bakery is closed after they asked  Its so rare that anyone tries to get any themselves  I mean  there have been times they dont put the bag over all   but even then  customers realize that its closed  I dont even know if this customer found tongs or not  I hope so  At least it was cupcakes and probably all of them It wasnt just the words  but the way he said it and his demeanor afterwords  At least he thanked me in an unexpected tone that I bagged his groceries  And we were able to say have a good night,1873,352
131,oqis8e,1,25,Kids get on my nerves sometimes Hello  This is my first post on this sub  Today was very eventful  but Ill just share this particular story Im a formal childcare worker  I LOVE working with kids  and thats no secret  But today the universe decided to test me I  M  work at one of those stores where everything is pretty cheap but theres really good variety in products  I was doing my business on register when suddenly I hear a weird buzzy beepy kinda noise  far off in the store  I look to my coworker on the other register and we both make confused faces and shrug  A few minutes later its still going and she asks me what that is  I say  Maybe its the emergency exit   She says that probably it  and goes to check it out She comes back and says yeah someone pushed open the emergency exit door  and nobody here has the key to make it shut up So we suffer Cue me apologizing for the noise to every customer I have to ring up and explaining that someone opened the emergency exit and we cant turn it off  so sorry maam Then a family comes up to my register  and this kid  young  but definitely old enough to know better  points out the noise and says  Haha that was me  It was an accident though   His mom says that he wanted to open it because he thought something was back there and wanted to go see it   So it  therefore  was not an accident  This is fine  No problem  I understand curiosity But then  This kid starts spinning the bagging station around while Im trying to bag things  whining to his mom the whole time about how he wants to go home and shes taking so long  I keep trying to bag things but he wont stop spinning it  so I just start scanning things and setting them to the side on my station instead of attempting to bag them  His mom tells him to cut it off and that Im trying to do my job Then he starts complaining about how he wants his toy and he wants it now  His mom says that I probably already bagged it  and then he accuses me of hiding it from him for some reason  Then he complains that some of our balloons are all the way up on the ceiling and shouldnt they be down lower  how will we get them down blah blah blah so I give my classic kid banter of  Hey if someone was really really tall they could just jump up and grab it  Kid laughs  I feel accomplished He doesnt help his mom put her bags in the cart  but he leaves  and thats what matters That was only  minutes into my shift  and now we had to wait for the boss to show up so we could deactivate the door,2539,477

134,oqc26w,1,97,I had a breakdown in front of customers after being forced to work during a power outage I used to work at a small grocery store in a very tourism driven town  At the store I worked a shift with what we called the ‘Zillennial Crew’  because literally all of us  including the manager  are under the age of   Earlier this week someone hit an electric pole with their car and knocked out the power for almost the entire town  This happened at about  pm which is two and a half hours before the store closes  The store’s backup generator kept things alive for about ten minutes  then everything went kaput  Everything except one check stand  at least  We think it had some kind of battery back up  Only half of it was working though  the cashier screen with the buttons  the cash drawer  and the receipt printer  No barcode scanner  no produce scale  no card reader  When the manager called the big boss  who was actually very mad at the manger for calling because it interrupted his golf session  he was told and I quote  “Since you still have a working check stand  you need to keep the store open until at least  ” Needless to say  myself and the rest of the crew weren’t too happy about that  but the big boss threatened to fire us if we didn’t  so we tried to make the best of it  Since I’d been assigned to the half working check stand before the outage and the manager didn’t have a key to open the other cash drawers  I was going to have to check After some brainstorming with the manager  I figure out how to manually put in grocery items and the rest of the crew man the automatic doors and search for flashlights  The set up was something like this     people at the doors informing people of what was happening   Customers without cash were immediately turned away   Customers were advised to have some form of light to navigate the store but we did have a few spare flashlights they could borrow   Customers told to not open freezer cooler doors until they were ready to make their selection   Customers told to take a picture of every item’s price tag and show the pictures to me I did that for an hour  On top of all that craziness  there were about a dozen alarms going off across the store because none of the coolers were on  a system meant to help ID if a cooler has stopped working  but not very helpful during a power outage   So there were a dozen or so loud  blaring  shrill beeps going off almost constantly  The entire hour   o’clock finally comes around  and right on cue  my check stand dies  I immediately break down crying  I cannot form words  The crew explained to the customers and convince them to put their items back  everyone got really pissy because ‘it was just working a second ago’   I have to sit down and try to collect myself  One of the crew sits with me trying to help me with some relaxing breathing  One of the customers decided to be snotty on their way out and said something like “Tell that fat stupid bitch to stand up and stop crying ” They were forcibly escorted out by the manager and one of the burliest crew members  Manager calls big boss  tells him we’re closing  Other workers sweep a bit and we all leave I ended up quitting a few days later  but  the whole situation still makes me mad,3263,601

145,oogrpd,1,1,Why third shift is the best shift… I graduated college and got a new job… real career move  But I miss my job as a third shift cashier at a convenience store  Here’s why…Third shift is when all the action took place  Whenever the cops were called  it was during my shift  Usually it was the drunk couples on their way home from the swingers club up the road  They’d come into the store and start really random fights with each other  They always tried to involve me and get me to choose a side  but I just told them I was there for the show and to be on standby in case things went too far  Weekends were the best because we got the drunks AND the stoned people AND the drunk stoned people  They are actually really funny  and easy to get along with  The only thing I hated was when a drunk person drove themselves  and I’d have to pull the emergency switch to shut down all of the gas pumps  It was amusing to see them on camera as they tried to figure out what was happening  It sucked to call the police on them  but we had to  We couldn’t just let them drive home  The cops told me they usually just escort them home  give them a ticket  and tell them they’ll go to jail if they do it again  I hope that’s true  When I’d have class during the day on a Friday then go to third shift that night  I’d be in a weird tired state that would get really amusing to me and my coworker  I remember one night somebody ordered a dangerous amount of fries  I dropped them in the fryer and started laughing my ass off  I was bent over  tears in my eyes  needing the bathroom kind of laughing  My coworker rushed over  thinking something  was wrong  Between my laughs  I managed to explain that when I dropped the fries in the fryer  I swore I heard the potatoes screaming as they went down  Time flies by on third shift  In our factory town  we would get a huge surge of factory workers at   am who were coming in for their breakfast before work  It was really rewarding to have conversations and get to know them as people  They often told us that we helped them get their day off on the right foot  Most importantly  my boss worked first shift  So I’d be out of there right as she came in  Never had to work with her  I worked with only one other person  so we had a very interesting friendship  Together  we got to experience these things and still look back at them fondly  Any fellow retail workers agree  Disagree  Maybe just a funny story  Sometimes I think about going back just for the heck of it  but retail is hard work  I often say that everybody should work retail once in their lives  Cheers,2615,501
146,oog9t4,1,1,I wrote this review for a customer service agent from Skyscanner  Preamble for Reddit  Customer service is difficult  frustrating  Often with no growth  For this one case  I wanted a write a glorious review  I hope it gets the agent a bonus  a promotion  or simply make her day  So I wrote this  and I meant all of it I faced a rare situation   I booked my flight through a rather unknown agent  Gotogate  and I couldnt board my flight due to lack of a transit visa that I was not aware of  The airline assured me that I can get a refund  but I can only get it via Gotogate  Gotogate was unresponsive  unreachable   I also found several hundreds of cases on facebook and twitter where people alleged that Gotogate didnt refund them  Some of these cases alleged that they hadnt got their refunds for more than a year I had given up hope for even a reply from them  let alone getting my money back  I had given up  blaming it on sheer bad luck Then  Skyscanner and mainly  Michele happened  A sheer stroke of luck  Michele not only put me in touch with Gotogate  she was the patient mediator and a pillar of support for over  months  Ive worked in customer service myself  and I have not seen anyone hold their patience for   months  But Michele did Because she was there  I trusted and felt confident that I could indeed get my money back  Im a student  and  euros is a big deal to me  Michele provided transparency  consistency and most importantly I could trust her   I had faith that its possible  I could relax and think  Shell do her thing and make it work   At the end of every message shed write  Im always there   Im very grateful for the support she provided   it was an unparalleled and a unique experience to completely trust someone I have never met  but I believed it was possible because she was there all the time  whenever I wrote an email Im grateful and lucky to have her assigned as the agent on this issue Many thanks to Michele  and Skyscanner,1994,362
147,ooe5k0,1,160,Wow just wow  Pissed everyone off  We had this idiot come in  minute before closing time at the store yapping away on her phone  We make several announcements  minutes to closing   minutes to closing   minutes to closing  final one at pm to say store is closed   After paging the store to say the store is closed at pm  we wait for that idiot to come up so we can ring her stuff up and everyone can go home  We waited for like  minutes and when we walked by each isle  we saw her on the wine aisle still yapping away with a few items in her arms  When we informed her that the store had been closed at   she was like no no let me finish my phone call first  We were nice enough to let her do that  and  minutes later  we walk up to her again and let her know that it is time to checkout so everyone can go home  We were about to page for the manager on duty to come up to the front and he would have loved to tell her off  Anyways  she comes up  minutes later  still yapping on her phone  After we ring up her items and tell her the total  she shoves her card in my face  expecting me to take her card  all while still yapping away on her phone  I clench my jaw to not say anything stupid  and inform her that she needs to swipe her card on the machine  She puts her phone down and tells me   dont play dumb with me   then immediately goes back to yapping on her phone  Wow  really lady  Fortunately  she eventually swipes her card on the machine then tells us  have a good day  while continuing to talk on her phone as she finally leaves the store  By now  its  pm,1590,318
148,ooczma,1,39,I just want gold    I work at a pretty small hardware store  I work best in mixing paint  and I also have a background in art so I’m pretty good with colors  I usually love helping customers with picking a color because most of the time  my customers respect my input and come back happy with the result  Last week I had the opposite  This is how the conversation went   WL  weird lady M  me   WL  “Can you make me a gold color like this ”She holds up a can of Rustoleum metallic paint  which is very shiny and not flat at all M  “I’m sorry miss but we only do flat colors  we just are unable to mix any metallics in the wall paints  “WL  “I didn’t say I wanted metallic  I just want a gold color ”M   is taken aback  “uh  well you can look at our color samples and see what’s closest to that gold ”WL  “i want you to help me find a color close to it because it’s your job ”at this point I’m just wanting to get the color made and boot her to the register  So I start looking at colors and suggesting some for her  she shoots every one down  M  “I think this is the closest I can find to the can you showed me”WL  I don’t want what the can is  I want gold M          “… ok  so you want something a bit more on the warm yellowish side ”WL  “I’ve already said I wanted gold a million times ”M   visibly frustrated  “can you show me roughly what you mean when you say you want gold ”  WL   picks out literally a very yellow shade and flicks it at me M  “is this the color you want then ”WL  “yes  it’s the closest thing you have to gold ”  it really isn’t but art is subjective so whatever M   makes her the sample as she watches closely  she sees me put in literally the exact name and sample she handed me  I put a dot of paint on top of the can and hand it to her  “Anything else I can help you with ”WL   inspects the top of the can for ten seconds  “This is not gold ” M  “Ma’am you chose that color yourself ”WL  “yes but this is not gold ”M  “but the paint is going to look exactly the same as the sample you provided ” WL  “I don’t care that it’s the same  It’s the wrong color ” M  “well you’re the one who picked it  so it’s not my fault if you don’t think you picked the right color  I will make you another one if you can find a sample you are sure you want ”WL   scoffs and looks at the colors a little bit longer  before handing me a slightly darker sample M  “are you sure this is the color you want  The paint is going to be exactly the same color and sheen of this sample ”WL  “yes  yes I’m sure  Just make my paint so I can get out of here already ”M   same process  sample is done  WL   inspects it again “This isn’t the right color ”M   finally snaps  “Ma’am  I asked you if this is the color you wanted  you said yes  twice  I told you the color will look EXACTLY like the sample  what on earth could possibly be wrong with this sample ” WL  “it’s not the same as the sample  it’s too yellow ” M   opens the can  dots the sample paper with the paint  and dries it  right in front of her  It blends in perfectly as it should WL   silence M  “I’m not wasting any more paint or time  Either take the paint or leave ”WL   grumbles and pays for the paint up front  This entire battle was over a   pint of paint,3301,622

150,onu566,1,0,The time an angry customer was   right but it’s wasn’t our fault So this story begins in a “lovely” store that rhymes with ballmart  At this point in time I had worked there for about  months in the electronics section  As some of you might know stores like to move product around for seemingly no reason and this was one of those times  We were moving our movie sections around  Think comedy moving to the thriller section and kids movies moved to another location  Either way this was a long annoying and somewhat pointless process  Now I would help wherever but our queen of movies  as I used to call her  is W  She was amazing and the fastest even though at this point she was a great grandma and one of the sweetest people I have ever had the joy to work with  Well during this large scale re arrange one particular movie was placed in its new home  The movie in question was Roots and it’s new home still had old signs  we were waiting for the replacements to come on the midnight truck  that read “comedies” We had one customer notice this and this gentleman was very very VERY angry  I do not blame him it’s completely understandable  However one would expect that seeing empty shelves and boxes full of movies all over the department that he would realize that we were not going to leave the movie there  Now Ms  W was a kind woman and   of the time she could have a customer laughing by the time they left even if they were screaming when they came in  Well this customer took her southern accent to mean that she purposely placed the movie there and was racist herself  At this point the customer is stepping closer to poor W and once I finished ringing out my customer I called for my manager H And went over to try and calm the guy down and to put some distance between him and W  Now in my area we aren’t super diverse regarding ethnicity  H was our only African American manager at the time  Once H finally arrived he pulled W aside to assess the situation and mr customer was bashing me the entire time  I mostly just agreed with him and kept trying to explain what was happening and why it was there  I even showed him where the movies would be and that the signs would be changed that night once they were delivered  H finally takes over  W goes to the back to collect herself and I helped the rubber necking customers that were in the area  H finally got the customer calm enough to listen to reason and ended up giving him a movie for free for the trouble W went to the customer after the fact to make sure he didn’t actually think she was racist   She had tears in her eyes because she didn’t want him to think she was racist   And he just walked away completely giving her the cold shoulder On my next break I bought W a coke and her favorite candy  I reminded her that she isn’t what one person says and she knows who she is and everyone that matters knows what kind of person she is and that’s what matters,2958,553

155,onftvk,1,39,Sorry lady  I don’t control taxes Yesterday I was at the register at the shoe store I work at and this woman brought in a pair of shoes that she wanted to exchange for a bigger size  Ok  no problem  I ask her for the receipt and she says she lost it  Again  not a problem  I ask her for her drivers license as per our no receipt return policy  she gives it to me  and I manually input the price of the shoes she was returning I scan the pair that she wanted to buy  and the difference is    because of taxes  She seemed confused  so I explained to her that we can’t do an even exchange because of taxes  She replies with “but I live in  neighboring county  and the taxes are the same there” I explain to her that the tax is dependent on where she bought the shoes  my store is part of a large chain with locations all over the country   and since we don’t have the receipt  we can’t verify whether or not she paid tax because we don’t know which store she purchased them from  Therefore  we could only refund her the listed price of the shoes  and she would still have to pay tax because my location taxes every purchase  I told her that I was very sorry for the confusion but I had no control over this  She proceeded to say “the  dollars isn’t the problem  you’re the problem ”At this point I was both shocked and pissed off  and I asked her what I did wrong  I don’t remember exactly what she said  but I think it was something along the lines of “I live in  neighboring county  where taxes are the same” I continued to try and explain that where she lives has nothing to do with how much she gets taxed  and that I also have no say in the matter and there was nothing I could do  She inserted her card but continued to rant about how I was the problem  I’m not perfect at my job but I’m pretty sure I’m very much not the problem in this case lol,1860,362

157,on6nts,1,34,Called an idiot because I was doing my job I work at a convenience store  and there are so many times where a customer comes in  gets  dollars worth of items and pats with a hundred dollar bill Now we can never keep enough change in the tills for something like that as a robbery prevention  as most dont want a bunch of  dollar bills and coins  So we ask if they have anything smaller or if they can pay with card  if not we inform them that we must take money out of the safe  and that it will take two minutes if the change is over  dollars as we can only take out  dollars at a time and must wait  minutes for the next tube of bills Some get mad  but most understand  but the one I had to deal with was another story It was the end of a shift and I had to count the money in the tills and and all the tubes of money in the safe  that means no tubes can go in or out until I finish counting  meanwhile my coworker helped the customers So a guy came in and bought I say  dollars worth and brought out a  dollar bill  now at that point we had no large bills as they were all in the safe  so my coworker asked the usual questions  and then I informed him that because I am counting the money  it will be a longer wait until I count the safe   So he got angry saying that  He couldnt wait and that his drinks would melt  he bought slushies I told him that he didnt have to wait long as I was almost finished  but that was still to long and said that  I will take a drink from this slushie and leaving  I apologized saying that it is a robbery prevention to not keep large bills in the till and that we couldnt take money out of the aafe while I was counting  his only response was  no you are an idiot for not knowing how to do your job  and left The thing is  it would have added an extra  minutes to him waiting so we could get him all his change   No idea if he was in a rush  but so many times I cant help but ask myself  why couldnt thet go to the bank to get smaller bills  and why so thet think convenience stores just have the money ready for them,2090,425

160,omrbhu,1,47,When the return policy is TOO lenient So back in April of this year I was working at this one retail store at a mall near my college  The return policy was that items could be returned within  days of purchase  it was fine if you didn’t have your receipt  and we could even bring up purchases for return through the card used in the purchase  Most items that got returned would be damaged out mainly if they were clearly worn or pose a risk in regards to sanitation  for example  beauty items returned always get damaged out  Regular clothing items  that don’t have visible wear don’t get damaged out though I’m gonna focus on a rather interesting return I had to process  So one day this woman comes in wanting to return a bra  and she didn’t have the receipt on her  I noticed the tags had been removed so I couldn’t do a no receipt return  However  we  one of my managers helped me  were able to trace the purchase through her credit card  and she was within  day of purchase so she was definitely eligible for return  She was able to get her money back of course  but I noticed some flaws in the bra when it was returned  She had clearly worn the bra  as it had pit stains and was kinda smelly  I already knew the bra had to be damaged out  As I was walking to the main register  I was ringing at a register in a separate part of the store  one of my managers asked what happened with the bra and looked disgusted  and I explained how it was clearly worn  and could no longer be sold  and another manager agreed that it had to be damaged out  So I filled out a damage tag  and tossed it in with the other damaged items Ultimately I don’t recommend you do what the lady who made the return did  If a store has a lenient return policy  they will likely accept items that have been washed,1805,344

162,omk0ix,1,34,Woman thinks Im being discriminating for calling her out for cutting in line I work at a store that has a food court  People line up in one long line and wait to be called up to place their order from either me or another cashier  Ive made it a habit to make eye contact and wave over the next customer because sometimes there is confusion on who is supposed to go next  There are times where people accidentally cut in front of others and I always tell them that they werent the next person in line and to go back to wait their turn  Most of the time  the person is apologetic and apologizes to both me and the person they cut in front of  Other times  they get defensive  but in the end they go back to their spot in the line  Well  today was a bit different  I was finishing up helping a customer and called for the next customer to my window  For reference  I have two windows and my register is in the middle of both windows  A man approaches my left window and a woman approaches my right window  I knew that the man was next because I saw the woman walk straight from her spot in the line to my right  window  disregarding the man who was waiting in the front of the line  The woman speaks up first before I could tell her to go back in line  The following dialogue was translated from SpanishWoman  Hello  two smoothies please  Me  Im sorry maam  but were you next Woman  What do you mean  Of course I was next Me  Well  it seems that gentleman over there was next Woman  I was waiting in line A woman from the line pipes up and says   Yes  she was waiting in line in front of me  Its alright   I nod my head to that woman and turn to look at the man on my left window  The man and I speak to each other in English  Man  Its alright  you can go ahead and help her first  I notice that the man was counting out his change anyway so I go to attend to the woman  She repeats her order  this time more harshly  Me  Before I start your order  I need to scan a membership card to ring you up Woman  You need a wait Me  Your membership card  please Woman  My goodness     Rolling her eyes  she waves over someone from outside the line  shouting at them to hurry up with the card  I check back on my left window to see if the man was done counting his change  but he isnt  Man  Its alright  go ahead and help her out Me  Oh  I was but Im waiting for her to bring her membership card Finally  a younger woman comes to the line asking what the line cutter woman needed  Woman  She needs to see a membership card to take my order  apparently  Younger woman  Oh okay  here it is I finally scan their card and as Im scanning it the line cutter woman turns to the younger woman and speaks loudly so I can obviously hear Woman  Lets never come here again  It seems that the employees like to discriminate against certain customers Me  Excuse me  Woman  You like to discriminate against people  dont you  Me  I dont understand  I asked you if you were next because I saw that you werent  Im not discriminating you  She waves her hand at me and just tells me her order again  I punch it in and just decide to let it go  but she decides to keep pushing my buttons  Woman  I hope she gives us good service  but she probably wont  Lets not come here again The thing that annoyed me the most about this woman was that she wasnt looking me in the face when she said this  Its like she didnt have the balls to say it straight to me  but wanted to seem tough in front of the younger woman  I cut her off from saying anything else and ask her if thats all she wants to order  The younger woman responds for her  I walk away to put the order together and my coworker asks if I need any help  I ask her to help the kind gentleman waiting patiently in the other window while I help the line cutter woman  I then return to the window with the womans items  Woman  Next time  dont discriminate against us Me  I wasnt being discriminatory  I asked you if you were next and you werent yet I still attended to you  I also need a membership card from every customer  not just you  Woman  Whatever  just dont do it next time  Me  You know what  Whatever  I know what I did wasnt discriminating you  Theres no point in arguing with you  NEXT PLEASE She walks away from my window  but not before saying one last thing before she left Woman  Dont discriminate Some people  man,4445,827

164,omdx99,1,28,Spider removal Short story but I still laugh about this  I worked in a big box store and there was a woman around my age who worked in cosmetics  She was very nice  but would frequently page people for help with even the smallest tasks One evening I was sitting in the break room with a few people from around the store  including the guy who was on “store standards”  cleaning carry outs cart retrieval  that shift and the girl from cosmetics started paging him  He ignored it because he was on his break  but she persisted  finally calling the break room to talk to him she said she needed a “spider removal”  Our store had recently gotten those “spider” locks for expensive items that require a special key to open  so he assumed it was that and went to go deal with it  He comes back several minutes later laughing the girl from cosmetics didn’t need a spider tag removed…there was a spider crawling across the cosmetics desk and she panicked and wanted someone to remove it for her,989,174
165,olwpms,1,148,Clever Thief Almost Got Away with   Worth of Merchandise This happened three days ago and Im still surprised I was working one of the registers on a pretty steady day  Not busy but not slow as pond water either  While I rang up a few customers  I noticed two managers  the head cashiers  talking and looking both concerned and amused  When there werent any customers waiting  I went to satisfy my curiosity when I noticed a cart stocked with lots of expensive power tools and batteries for said tools  My first thought was a customer forgot their wallet in their car and went to get it  happens more often than you think  or a customer went to grab something else before checking out Welp  no such thing According to the head cashier  HC  s female  who was watching self checkout at the time  a male customer came up to scan those items  There was another customer doing the same while the HC watched  but she noticed something while the guy was scanning things Now  every time something is scanned for purchase at any register  an image of it appears on the screen  The guy appeared to be scanning the power tools and batteries  but the head cashier noticed everything he had scanned on the screen didnt match the products he had  The screen showed several lines of the same small bit of PVC pipe  which was worth a buck and change  and this guy didnt have ANY PVC piping in his cart whatsoever The HC noticed this and quickly gathered the courage to properly approach the customer as he was nearly done  She told him  very professionally  there was an issue because he was scanning as they didnt match the image on the screen  The customer feigned ignorance while the HC proceeded to scan one of the items he  already scanned  and sure enough  the correct item appeared on the screen with the correct triple digit price tag  She proceeded to remove what he scanned already and scanned every item correctly  Suddenly the customer is surprised and says he cant afford all that  The HC does the  Do you want to save some money by signing up for the company credit card   bit  to which he declines and leaves empty handed Turns out the guy had a little barcode sticker ON HIS FINGER for PVC and scanned it to make it seem like he was scanning the other items  If the HC hadnt paid proper attention  the dude wouldve walked out of the store with almost   worth of merchandise  Other managers were informed of the incident and the ASMs  assistant store managers  gave the HC props for handling the situation so well We have some wayward youths working at our store who have a bad habit of neglecting their duties in favor of socializing with each other  This scenario should serve as a learning experience for them and future employees to be more vigilant As messed up as the situation was  I was impressed at the thiefs clever approach,2868,500

168,olhsp6,1,113,No  sir  I cannot use an online code for in store purchases  I work in an auto shop  and recently became a manager there  My boss had warned me that the higher you go in retail  it gets harder to deal with customers  I thought he was joking because I’ve pretty much had pretty chill and downright friendly customers for the majority of my time working there But this one customer  Goddamn  He actually made my blood boil  I’m not a violent or angry person by any means  but he was actually testing my patience First he walks in the store  and shows me the product he needs on his phone  He had already visited the website  so he already knew what he was looking for  All right  cool  This’ll be a quick transaction  So I get the product for him  and go to my register  As I’m about to scan it  he hits me with this Customer  I’d like to use this code  shows me an online code on his phone Me   stares at him  Are you planning to buy the product online Customer  No I want to use the code in here Me  I can’t use that code  You can only use it online Customer  But it’s your store  It’s the same thing  it’s your website  Me  I’m aware that the website and our store have the same name  But we have no control over whatever happens online  Customer  Where’s the manager Me   giddy on the inside to finally use the quote  I am the manager  And I’m telling you  that this code is not going to work in the store Customer  Well why can’t you just honor it Me   stares at him again  Honor what  There’s nothing to honor  because this is an online code  And you are currently in the store  In store purchases and online purchases are completely separate things  It’s not going to work Customer  I didn’t see you type it in Me   never taking my eyes off him  proceeds to type in the code  move the monitor so he can see it  I hit enter  and nothing happens  Customer  … Well something’s wrong with your computers  because the other stores have done this for me Me   almost losing my temper  There’s no way the other stores have done this  The code is supposed to be used online  so if they were to type in the computer at the store  they would’ve gotten the same result as me  Nothing Customer   makes a big huff and finally goes into his email to pull up a coupon that can be used in the store   I’ll be calling corporate about this Me  You do that I relayed the entire interaction with this guy to my boss  and he laughed his ass off  and even his boss lost it when he told him I’m all good now  but man  that customer was not listening to a word I said,2590,470
169,olho8w,1,71,That time I kinda went off on a “customer” Calling him a customer is being generous  and this took place earlier this week  My coworker was in the restroom and I had a small line  Nothing big just three people with a few things  A fourth one skips the line to ask me if we have any more six packs of a specific beer  I tell him I’m not sure but I can definitely check the cooler for him once I finish  He walks off and I finish the line quick  I didn’t see the guy anywhere and figured he hit the bathroom so I go ahead and dip into the cooler  Except when I open the cooler door  the guy walks out carrying his beers  Now I assume  and I genuinely hope  all of you know why that is a BIG NO NO  Customers don’t go into the back room  they don’t go into the walk in cooler  I try to shrug it off  retain that customer service tone and tell him that he cant go back here  if he had been patient I told him I was going to go in it and get him his beer  His response  ”Whatever”  and an attempt to shoulder past me  That burned any chance he had  I told him to hand me the beer  he stared at me dumbly so I said louder and firmer that he is to hand me the beer  Then I tore into him  “Non employees are  not  to go into the coolers  You were told to wait  Because of that you need to leave the store  Now ”As you can guess he complained and then said he wasn’t leaving without his beer  I straight up told him as he was told to leave his refusal meant he was trespassing  I WILL be calling the police if this continues  He needs to walk his ass out the door either on his own or brought out by cops  I will not be serving him in the future and if I see him in the store on any future I will be kicking his ass out upon sight  Then he had the gall to claim that what I was doing wasn’t right  that   he hadn’t done anything to warrant being kicked out    I pointedly told him that going into employee areas can and will get customers kicked out of the store  I then pointedly went to the office as it was closer to get the phone  This dude swore at me and stormed out yelling that he would call my boss and called me a bitch  After that I threw some carts to block the entry to the back room coolers  and left a note for other staff that hey  people are going into the coolers  And one for the boss to please get the cooler door fixed  the handle broke clean off three weeks ago  so we can lock it Wtf is these ppls thought process tho  to think that hey it’s perfectly fine to  walk into the coolers,2517,506

171,okyuwb,1,24,The day the register froze So  idk if it’s like this at other places but the gas station I work at only keeps one register up after   Partly because it’s slower during the last  hours and partly because there’s only one person working after   Usually that isn’t an issue  Occasionally I’ll have people complain  or outright ignore the “register closed” signs to try and scan their items themselves cause they don’t wanna wait in line  A few months back while handling the last couple of customers for the night  the retail gods decided to make things harder  I only had the one register up  store closed in  minutes and I had a line of three  The lady and her son that I was helping was trying to buy several cases of beer  Usually no issue  so long as the parent pays for and carries said alcohol  Well  while she was doing this  she decided half way through the transaction  paying via card  that she wanted to add smokes and one of our single oz cans of bud to the purchase  So I hit cancel  rang those up  started the transaction over  then she cancels it on her end because she didn’t think the price was right  I guess the system didn’t like it being canceled so much so quickly because after she ran her card a third time  the register outright froze  the system froze completely  The only thing I could do would be to completely reboot the register  Which takes  minutes  and by that point it was a minute until we closed  I could do nothing for her purchase on this register  and I couldn’t jump on the other register as it was down for the night  I’d have to do a shift change on it  which as a closer I was not trained to do and would not be able to do  I felt bad for the customers as I wouldn’t be able to help anyone  none of the would be able to make a purchase   Most were understanding  One of my regulars bitches a little about not being able to buy her Nattys  The ones at the register however insured they be able to take home the beer and smokes they bought  I explained that because the register froze it is unlikely their csrd went through and I can’t let them walk out with almost   with or merchandise without confirmation their card even went through  They kept insisting and so I decided screw it  here is what we will do  I had them write their name and number  and if the register unfreezes before I left and the payment went through I’ll call them so they can pick the stuff up  Otherwise morning will call them if it went through  Their card did not go through in the end  I felt bad and understood where they were coming from but also I don’t think there’s a store that would let you leave with that much unpaid stuff if the system froze,2692,510

178,ojzqco,1,16,I wanted to give you flowers  but you stole my money Hey everyone i hope your doing great  English is not my native language  but i also have no respect for it so i dont really care about mistakes haha  Also Im not from the US and taxes are included in the prices we have  amp  xB I recently started working at a local grocery store  its actually a big chain  where I work  hours a week split into two shifts with  hours  So I could be working monday   tuesday one week and the next week friday   saturday  So if you come to see me specifically for whatever reason the chances Im actually there arent that high and this story takes place on a thursday my second shift that week and i wasnt working until the thursday the next week   Also we have those automatic things that move the producets from a bit back of the line to the front but i dont even know what its called in my native language  Well a few weeks ago this wome came up to my register  I already have the first product in my hand  ready to scan when she proceeds to tell me she forgot her wallet and cant pay  She would have to go home and get her wallet  that would take her about min  My shift was another hour and we dont have an official company rule but everyone working there just rings up  is that how you say it  well i scanned all her products and told the register she payed  and she left the things at my register I go on with my shift and already kinda forgot about her when she comes to my register again with another beer and some flowers she also wants to buy  I get someone authorised to deal with cancelling her first purchase so my balance is right in the end  Until they come I tell the flowerlady the price something like  €  which she knew because i told her before she left but now she says it cant be that high blabla and she puts a € bill on this thing that moves the products infront of her about an armlenght away from me holding two more in her hands  My supervisor comes and then recalculates the price while we wait for her  The flowerlady still saying its not the right price  but surprise it was  who guessed the register could be right    Well now she wants to pay but the bill she but down in front of her isnt there anymore and she accuses me and my supervisor of taking it  She gets kinda agressive in her tone  demanding that we write down our names  what we do  and in a kinda sad and dissapointed tone she says something like I wanted to give you those flowers for being nice but now i cant do this anymore  like i care about some ugly and tiny bouquet of flowers bought from a grocery store   After paying she wants to leave but she still has the flowers and the beer and I remind her she has to pay those aswell  what she does and then she leaves  On a side note the customer after her  who patiently waited for about  minutes  goes on a little rant about the flowerlady saying he knows her and she always makes problems So I go on with my live and actually have a good laugh telling this story to my mother  I go in the next week for my first shift  it was an evening shift  and because there was a big turn over of cashiers my register wasnt ready yet  Well as Im waiting my supervisor  a difrrent one  tells me that some Lady left flowers for me yesterday  so wednesday  and she wrote an apology on a reciept paper   I wish I knew what turned in this Ladies mind that she realised noone stole her money and what in the world made her think coming back and actually buying me flowers was a good idea but you know i appreciate the gesture and till this day my supervisor and I laugh about it   Those flowers are currently dying in my appartment  but I actually tried taking care of them haha,3728,717
179,ojz7dw,1,6,Stay happy  friend   So  this one guy was a tax exempt  which means I need to get a manager to scan a card to enable the tax exempt stuff  So I do that  and I’m checking the guy’s items  no big deal  But then the TE guy  tax exempt  says he needs some cigarettes  So  I go to help him get some cigs  It took like  minutes  he was buying in bulk  When we got back  the TE guy struck up a conversation with the guy behind him  he apologized  said he did this once a month  blah blah  And then he was getting ready to pay  the TE guy was   and the guy behind him said  “Oh  what now  is the check gonna bounce or something ” And I thought this was just a joke  you know  like friendly banter  And I think the TE guy thought it was a joke  too  So the TE guy said  after he paid with a credit card   “All right  bye  stay happy  friend ” In a real friendly way  But then guy behind him says  “F  CK OFF ”   The TE guy  who was chill  said  “Oh my God ” and left  So then I started checking out the guy who said f off  Ill refer to him as Karen   I was doing my thing  and I scanned one case of water bottles in his cart  and I moved it  cause I wanted to see if the other case in the cart was the same or a different brand  Turns out  it was the same  But Karen said  “Oh  just scan the top one twice ” In a really exasperated voice  So I did  He then added  “Is it your first day or somethin’ ” And I responded  “I am new ”  which is true  I started like a week ago   And he said  “I can see that ” And then I continued  One of my managers came over  because my light was flashing from the TE guy  we click a button to make our lights flash on and off in order to get a managers attention if we need help   and asked if anything was wrong  Karen chimed in and said  “He’s fine  but the customer’s not  This service is terrible  I usually go to   other store    but I decided to try   this store    and I’m never coming back  I’m sticking with   other store   ” and the manager was like “Okay sir  I’m sorry sir ” in a voice that sounded like she wanted to say “All right you scrub  just shut up and get your receipt you moron”  so I dont think Im going to get in trouble  And then I gave Karen his receipt and then he left  Good riddance,2241,452
180,ojyoks,1,73,Don’t judge a book    So tonight I had a very nice family come to the register  Mother  Daughter  a maybe  year old and a toddler the mother was holding  Told them to give me a second cuz I had to show my boss something down the aisle  in view of the register   I come back and cash them out noticing a birthday balloon they placed at the end of my belt was missing and in its place was an empty package for skull caps  Manager went and watched the cameras  He came back laughing  Apparently in the thirty seconds I was gone the mother ditched the empty package that she had hiding under the toddler and shoved the balloons in her purse  They paid for everything else and were really nice which is why he was laughing  The total of what they stole vs what they paid     stolen but they paid for the   worth of stuff  Never assume a wholesome family is just a nice innocent customer,888,170

182,ojqj7f,1,116,“Honey  is this really all you have ” Alright  so  I used to work at a gas station  I worked the overnight shift  and just know this I’m ’  I’m tiny  and I’m working overnights by myself  This was back in November of   Around am  a man comes in with a mask on and his hood up  I looked up at him and he said  “Do you have any Marlboros ” I thought it was weird he asked that  because there’s how many kinds behind me you can see  So I say back  “yes  what kind ” He seemed taken back by my question for some reason  I thought he was maybe on drugs  because it happens  He then says  “Oh  um  Marlboro reds ” I turned around and grabbed the cigarettes off of the shelf behind me  Just as I was about to scan the cigarettes  the man suddenly came behind the register  He stood behind me with something pressing against right my side  “Give me your money honey ” he said to me  I felt so scared and froze for a moment  I opened my register and while doing so I attempted to press the panic button about five times  The nearby police station is literally like  mins away  “Are you trying to call the cops ” He asked me  In that moment  I didn’t know if he actually saw me press the button or not  but it scared me even more  I didn’t know if he would hurt me  I didn’t know what he had against my side  This man had the audacity to ask me  “Honey  is this all the money you have ” I was so dumbfounded by this question  Even if I had anymore money I wouldn’t tell you  It’s the middle of the night that was your first mistake buddy  Suddenly he starts rushing me out of nowhere  I ended up giving him all the bills out of my register which only came to  something  After he takes the money he runs off and I called the cops  Camera footage shows him dropping a knife  I was so terrified and in shock I didn’t realize it fell  I just wanted him to get off of me and leave me alone,1887,372
183,ojodn3,1,10,There are such things as dumb questions  I work in a couple souvenir shops in a little mountain town  This is my first retail job in about  years  and I dont feel like Ive gotten as many head scratchers at past retail jobs as I have this summer  Most of them are silly things that I just either get annoyed with answering over and over or questions that I would never have thought to be asked  Here are a few of them  People asking me if they can put stickers on their truck  Its a damn sticker  itll stick to any smooth surface  I dont give a hoot where you put it  People asking me if a fanny pack is in fact a fanny pack and how to wear it  Yes  it is a fanny pack  and once again I do not care  wear it however you want  One person even bought one only after I confirmed that fanny packs are currently  trendy   I have also been asked how to wear a regular backpack several times   People asking me if I have anymore of a certain shirt thats on display in the front window  No  we just like to taunt everyone with what they could have  What kind of store advertises things in the window and doesnt have them for sale in the store   People asking me if my dog is real  If you cant tell a real dog from a statue  I just dont know what to tell you   Unrelated to the store itself  more so to the town Im in  People asking me if there are bears in town  Were in the heart of the rockies  if bears being here is a surprise to you  please dont venture too far from main street  On the same note  I have also been asked how somebody could find a mountain lion  and at what elevation deer become elk  Seriously   People asking me if we still have a product that the store sold several years ago  when there are clearly none on the shelf  Maybe its just if you have worked retail  but that one should be pretty obvious  I feel  People asking me if they can take a product out of the store so they can find the person they want to show it to  Correct me if Im wrong  but I dont think ANY store would let you walk outside with an unpaid for product   Shakes head Thats all for now  Again  mostly harmless questions  just with seemingly  to me  obvious answers that I have to answer almost every day  Anyway  hope you guys enjoyed reading  and best of luck with the rest of the summer season in the US,2327,445
184,ojl78a,1,8,Definitely not trying to steal Having a lot of these stories recently  must be due to the tourist season Guy in the store for a loooong time  Almost an hour  At one point the only guy in the store  Spending a lot of time in one corner at the front by vacuums  Refusing help when asked  At one point  grabs a Bluetooth speaker  heads straight for that same corner  My colleague tells me that to intercept as I can see him walking quickly towards the door  Apparently he couldnt get the spiders  alarms  off the boxes  so he wouldve set off the door alarms  so I guess he must be quick I intercept   Hi  I can pop those through for you   Not a happy face but not an outwardly annoyed one either Scanning through his items  I say  you can get a guarantee with the speaker  Ill just need some details for the system  I assume that youre a mister      this is a joke I throw in with a smile to all obviously male presenting customers and I almost always get a laugh  not today Customer   WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU NEED MY DETAILS   THE RECEIPT IS ENOUGH  Me  taken aback by him going   instantly  but staying calm   The system is just asking for details incase something goes wrong  so its easier for us to find your details  If youre not happy with that  though  Ill just pop down Mr X   Cue another minute or so of shouting about us not needing his details  his aggression being met with a smile from me because hes has to pay nearly £ for products he hoped to get for free  He definitely didnt look suspicious screaming over being asked for his name  though,1593,288
185,ojij5k,1,10,Gift boxes are not complicated Customer asks for large gift boxes  I let him know the largest we carry is the kind for clothes  He kinda looks at me weird and then asks where they are  I point him to the correct aisle and go on my merry way  Few minutes later  he comes back and says he couldnt find them  Im a little concerned because they are in a spot that makes them easy to find  but whatever  I go to the aisle and point them out  He stares at them like he doesnt believe me   Do these have the top and bottom   At this point I realize that he thought the boxes would already be made  while these were flat and needed to be unfolded  I explain that to him  He still has a look that says he doesnt really believe me  but I guess he relents  Then he asks   can you wrap them   To me it sounded like he was asking if these boxes had the capability to be wrapped so I was like  yeah the gift wrap is right here  Then hes like   do  you  wrap them   And Im like  oh no we dont offer gift wrapping services  Once again he looks at me like Im the stupid one   Well  Ill buy it  will you wrap it    Now Im getting angry  We do not offer gift wrapping services  He is still giving me this stupid look so I just ask if he needed anything else and walk away when he said no lolAll of this just gave me the feeling that this grown ass man has never given a gift before in his life,1391,278
186,ojejxa,1,105,Man leaves after I ask if he wants to pay before I make his order I work in a store where we also sell sandwiches  This guy came in and asked me to make him one  Okay  no problem  There is someone else in the store who usually makes them  but she was busy so I said Id make it instead  which I can do with no problems   I then asked the costumer if he wanted to pay before I made his order since thats usually easier for both me and the costumer  He responded saying that if making a sandwich is too hard for me to do hell just go get it somewhere else  I was stunned since I just said I would make it for him  Anyway he left and I wish him good luck with trying to find another shop that sells sandwiches at this hour,722,149
187,ojb2ib,1,17,TV that smells So a couple of years ago when I was working at retail  there was this old guy around  that I sold him a TV and the extra warranty that the store provided He comes the next day claiming that his TV has a weird smell   my manager happened to be at the same floor and he heard us so he came and said the same thing I said to the customer if he could bring it at the store so we can check it out  he said sure and then asked me if I could show him another TV similar to that which I replied with yes in my mind I was thinking that he probably wants to see one because of the extra warranty which basically provides you with another TV while your TV is getting fixed  So I went ahead I showed him the TV and he randomly kneels and sniffs the tv from the bottom up and said yes this one doesnt smell I was frozen I didnt know how to react I was trying my hardest not to laugh but a smile escaped  and not only that he told yeah smell it   it has no smell he was waiting me to smell it so I went ahead did a quick sniff I watch behind me and I see my manager and the cashiers laughing The guy left shortly after that I kept asking the other coworkers if he ever came back or brought the TV which they replied with a no I just hope it was not a fetish I have more stories to share  I just found out this sub reddit I might post them if you guys want,1363,281
188,oj8okx,1,9,Cash register story So I just started a new job in a grocery store and basically my only job is to attend the only cash register  This isn’t my first job  and I have ran registers before  So on my very first day  I had this guy walk up with like a pack of gummies and some other items  He sits the gummies down and mumbles something under his breath  So I ring his stuff up and when I get to his gummies I ask if he wants them or if he wants them in a bag and he just looks at and yells “no I said I want to eat them”  Now my hearing isn’t that good and I know he mumbled anyway so I just ignored it  I don’t remember his total  but for the sake of the story  we’ll just say it was    He hands me a  and a nickel  And I give him the change the register tells me  which obviously included pennies  He looks at me and goes no this isn’t right  and I go “excuse me ” And he said “I gave you that nickel so I wouldn’t have any pennies  I swear you damn kids can’t do math or anything now a days  I can do math in my head” I didn’t say anything and just took his pennies and rounded it up and gave him a nickel  and I didn’t say anything and just kept looking down the whole time because I’m a relatively shy person  But if your change already wasn’t a multiple of  then adding a nickel wouldn’t change that  This is essentially just me ranting the story,1357,280
189,oj5na3,1,89,No one greeted me when I walked in I used to work at a home goods store that was known for its imports that has since gone bankrupt My store’s location was closing permanently due to our landlord not renewing the lease and this particular story takes place during the last month the store was open This particular night there were three of us working  me  another associate  and the sales lead  It was the closing shift and the store was closing early because we had reduced hours since the store was going out of business  The store is almost empty of inventory since we’re so close to closing and you can basically see whoever walks in from anywhere in the store  Company policy normally is that someone stays near the front of the store to man the cash register and be able to greet any customer that walks in Well tonight the store was surprisingly busy  there were about  customers in the store and they all wanted to ask questions and have their hands held through choosing things and we had to start closing duties And at this point  when the other associate had walked to the back to start closing duties and me and the sales lead were both actively helping other customers  in walks Brenda I see her enter the store but can’t greet her as I’m talking to another customer but I make a mental note to follow up with her  The customer I was helping had a ton of questions and I didn’t get away from them for another ten minutes after Brenda walked in  At that point Brenda is looking at a display by the cash register so I walk up and ask her how she’s doing and she informs me she’s ready to check out No problem  I can do that  We made pleasant small talk while I rung her out and explain that everything is final sale and my sales lead was able to come up and help bag things about halfway through the transaction to help speed things up  As we come to the end of the transaction Brenda starts talking about how it’s a shame the store is closing then sighs and says “but it’s no surprise I guess since no one even greeted me tonight when I came in ”I was taken completely off guard and kind of froze but started to try to apologize and she doubled down and said “oh no  It’s true none of you bothered to try to talk to me when I walked in ”I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was something to the effect of “I’m sorry I was with another customer but we do make our best efforts to greet everyone but sometimes it’s just not possible ” Then she replied with something snarky and left It made me super mad though because the store was literally closing and we were all going to be jobless in a month but go forbid we don’t say hi to you when you walk in to our bare bones store,2713,509

191,oj0kjp,1,56,Customer weirdly hostile to cashier  this woman came I last night while I was training a new employee  and right off the bat it was clear she didn’t like me  She and coworker were both Native American and I am not  idk if that had anything to do with why she hated me on sight but immediately acted like she was BFFs with coworker  Neither coworker or I had ever met her before that night  She was short and curt when I said the usual hello  but she was very bubbly and friendly with my coworker  She had loudly asked how much a pack of x brand smokes cost while I was helping a customer before her so coworker grabbed the smokes for me to scan when I was done  when I rang up the cigs and told her the total she just went “Huh  What ” She hadn’t been paying attention so I told her that x type of x brand is so and so amount   ”Oh   Okay ” And she immediately pulled out a   so I had to stop her and gesture to her case of beer  ask if she was paying for that separately  the woman just scoffed and put it down  angrily going a saying how shes paying for them together in that “what are you  an idiot ” tone that all retail workers are familiar with  I’m biting my tongue and just thinking in what world does a  pack of beer and cigs come up to under    Plus when would I have scanned it  She had it cradled in her arms the entire time Then she looked to the kid I was training  telling him that since I’m so slow he should take over  while laughing like it’s a funny joke  neither me or coworker laughed   Then once her attention was on me as I gave her the new total  she had this awful scowl and demanded a lighter  the lighter rack was right by her hand on the counter  She demanded the price of a lighter  eve though the price tags were right in front of her  I gave her the price range anyway  She didn’t like that answer and demanded the cheapest  Didn’t even let me answer before she grabbed one and threw it on the counter  During that time I had grabbed a can of beer the customer before her had decided against buying and left on the counter  handed it to coworker asking him to put it back on the shelf  Woman exploded “THATS NOT MINE ” as if I was ringing it up  I know it’s not yours  ma’am  That’s why i asked coworker to put it back on the shelf  But that went in one ear and out the other for her because she angrily reiterated that she’s not paying for that since she didn’t ask for it  Again  i tell her this had nothing to do with her purchases and wasn’t being rung up  She scoffs and says she’s not paying for someone else’s beer  I ignore it and force the topic elsewhere by giving her the final total for her three things  It’s like over  and she accuses me of ringing it up wrong because it’s too expensive  So I read off whats been rung up and how much each item was  Beer and smokes aren’t cheap  sorry to break it to you  She paid  made some loud comments to coworker about how our boss needs to hire people who know how to work checkout  and left  All throughout it she would ignore me for periods to chat with coworker telling him jokes or other small talk things and then get angry when she talked to me  It was weird af to me,3177,620

193,oilw7u,1,81,No  Im not giving you another free giveaway  So I work at your average grocery store in Canada  its moderately busy and I commonly work at the self check out station or behind the customer service desk  A few days ago  I happened to be working for the self checkout station  I was standing by the customer service desk when an older lady  OL  stops in front of me on her way out  For context  our store occasionally gives away a certain item if you spend over a certain amount  This week  it was a box of snacks  like oeros  ect  OL  Is that your giveaway for this week for spending over x amount  Me  Yes  I can grab you one if youd like  OL  Well  I dont want it  Can you do a substitution At this point  Im thinking that she may have dietary restrictions or something  Weve done substitutions for people who want a vegetarian option before  I was wrong  Me   Are you thinking of a substitution for dietary reasons She looks super confused  even with her mask on  OL  No  Im asking for another option because I dont like that giveaway  Dont you have anything else Me  Unfortunately we do not  this is our only giveaway for this week  You dont have to take it  though  Most  if not all people who dont want the giveaway just say no when offered it or donate it to the bread basket box we have in our store  She started walking away from me  so I thought the conversation was done by this point  But she turns around  OL  Well  I think you should offer me another option  especially if the customer doesnt like the one the store has  Me  I understand  but unfortunately  this is the giveaway that was chosen for this week  There is no other free option  She was pretty annoyed at this point  OL  Thats ridiculous  Whats the value of the giveaway  then Me  The value of the giveaway is  dollars  but it is given for free when spending over x dollars  OL  Well  take  dollars off of my bill then  This doesnt even make sense  since the product we giveaway is   free  Its nothing like a coupon  I was super confused now  Me  Unfortunately  I cannot do that  That giveaway is the only option the store offers this week  OL  This store needs to offer another giveaway  It was getting busy again  and I was getting pretty tired of repeating the same thing over and over again  Me  Well  you can take the free giveaway  Or  your other option is to not take it all  She didnt say anything after that and walked away from me  so luckily for me that was the end of that,2529,459

195,oiicx7,1,0,Quarter Lady This is one of my favourite retail ‘horror stories’ to tell  I work at a drugstore  and in the couple days before Christmas we used to be open until midnight instead of PM   now we close early on Christmas Eve  lol So it’s Christmas Eve  about   PM  I make the announcement over the loudspeaker that we’re closing in  minutes  please proceed to the checkout  etc etc  This lady wanders over and asks if I can help her in electronics  which is just next to the main checkout  I help her  recommend a nice pair of headphones for her kid  and she comes up to my till at about   with a full cart  All in all her total is around    And her credit card declines  At this point the supervisor has come over to pull the security gate  The lady says “oh I have cash in my car  can I run and grab it ”We say okay  because Good Customer Service™️ and all that  So she comes back with a purse and starts pulling out   bills  And I’m thinking to myself okay  that’s manageable  Then she pulls out rolls of quarters  She paid   in quarters  We were stuck in the cash office counting quarters for  minutes,1138,212
196,oidyat,1,45,Customer is mad about price… Hello all  first time poster here  So I started working for a retail supply store in the recent months  I use to be a server and switched to retail and it’s been pretty good but today is the first day I’ve had a bad customer interaction So a lady comes in and is looking for some hair rollers  I show her what we have in stock and go about my day  She found some that she wanted and she asked what the price was  I told her what the tag said  since she said she could not see very well  I told her  based on the tag price  that it was only a few dollars  We immediately go to the register and the rollers ring up about   more  The rollers were placed in the incorrect location  I immediately tell her the price difference and she gets super upset  I tell I am sorry but they were placed in the wrong location  She tells me that since I told her they were a cheaper price  that I had to honor that price  I tell her I have to call my manager because I cannot change an items price without my managers approval  This lady is very insistent that I have to honor the price I told her  even though I told her they were placed in the wrong location  So she gets more upset when I can’t get my manager on the phone  The lady then demands my name and my managers name  I give it and I also call my manager again  My manager answers and I explain what happened in all of the five minutes I interacted with this lady  My manager says we cannot override the price because it was such a big difference and the only thing we can do is give the lady our customer service number  I say okay and inform the lady of what my manager has said  The lady decides to not buy anything and tells me she will “take care of this tomorrow”  I tell her okay and have a good day  I guess she thinks that I said something else under my breath and gets aggressive and basically says I will be lucky to keep my job after this  I just keep telling her to have a nice day and she eventually leaves  I guess I just don’t understand  being new to retail  why she got so aggressive  Anyway  I guess not the worse interaction but I definitely felt bad afterwards  TL DR Lady is rude over price difference and thinks she is going to get me fired,2248,441
197,oiamnj,1,22,I go the extra mile for a challenging customer and barely get a thank you I was just getting done a huge rush of paint orders and getting ready to grab a  gallon bucket for a nice couple when this woman walks up to the desk  blocking my way out  holding four tubes of subfloor adhesive  She’s got That Look on her face  y’all know the one  “I need a case of these  but you only have these four  do you have a case anywhere ” “If they’re not in that aisle I think we also keep them in lumber ” I answer  trying to finish this couple’s order  They’ve been here since before the rush was over and were very polite and patient  “Well  can you call and ask ” The customer asks  “I have to pick up some plywood and I really don’t want to walk back over here  I stumble over a reply trying to say I know for a fact they’re over there  then give up and dial lumber  I’ve seen it over there before  but considering the shortages of products I couldn’t guarantee it would be there  Naturally  they don’t pick up  Getting annoyed  I decide screw it  I’ll go look myself  I ask my coworker to finish the order I’m working on and let the customer know I’m going to check myself  She’s still blocking the opening to the desk  so I have to step around her to get out  I first check our aisle  which surprise surprise  nothing in top stock  and then walk all the way down to lumber  which is across the store from paint  my department  Thankfully we have some  nearly a full case  so I pick them up and walk them over to her  she was following about  feet behind   I set them in her cart  and the says  “you found those pretty quick  you don’t have one that’s not opened  I don’t want these rolling around in my car” “No  sorry ” I say  “This is all we have ” “And it’s not even a full case ” she gripes  “but I have these four so I guess it’s okay ” She thanks me halfheartedly and walks away  This woman took me away from my job  made me walk across the store to find a product from her  I carried a full case of construction adhesive to her cart  which is kind of heavy  and it still wasn’t good enough  And the “thank you” I got was out of necessity  not because she was particularly grateful for what I did  Lower your standards  lady,2245,431

204,oi06ma,1,12,Due to Technical Difficulties  Guy Threatens to Rob the Place I work in a retail chain that is prevalent in a lot of small towns   The equipment tends to malfunction a lot  but we always find ways around these problems to keep the cash flow coming and the customers happy Well  July rd  our store suffered a brownout   The lights dimmed and brightened for about five minutes  and then a particularly strong dimming made alarms go off in the store as well as shut down the registers   After everything came back online  it was realized that the card machines no longer worked   The stores connection to the net was down  as were the phone lines   We tried to restart everything  but nothing worked and tech support was useless   So we had to do something we knew would hurt us that day We had to accept cash only Bear in mind  we were insanely busy with people buying supplies for their cookouts and such   We made a point to inform EVERY  SINGLE  PERSON  who came through the doors that we were accepting cash only   Most people either said okay  or turned around and left   But one customer   he decided that this was an absolute affront to him personally   He stood at the entrance of the store  pacing back and forth  and literally growling   My line was very long  and I was working as fast as I could to check people out   All the while  this man is still making angry sounds and muttering to himself At one point  he approaches me and snarls  Im not kidding  he really snarled   Why are you only taking cash    Me    We had a brownout  and our card systems are down right now  Him    getting  or at least trying to  in my face   Then you need to lock the       damn doors    He stomped outside   I was hoping this was the end of it  so I apologized to the person I was checking out  who looked stumped to say the least   A few customers later  the man stomps back inside and yells for everyone to hear  What if I came back and robbed the place   This was a VERY bad move  as some of our sister stores had been robbed in recent weeks   I was stressed out beyond belief  and as someone who suffers from major depressive disorder and severe anxiety  I snapped back  No one is robbing this place while Im standing here    The man went scowled and dashed out of the store   My manager burst from the office  looking after him    Did he just say what I think he said   Me    Yep  She went after him  and made sure that he left the premises   There was only one other problem customer that whole day  but this guy was the worse of the two,2568,475
205,ohwawu,1,114,No sir  I am not hiding roasted chicken from you  We are just closed  So I find this event amusing after the debate I sparked in another thread about the hate relationship  food retail workers have with those  last minute  shoppers  To clarify what I mean by  last minute   Im not talking people coming during open business hours  Im talking the people that walk up  as  youre closing and start demanding service  So for the last two days a post I made sparked debate on whether or not we should have the right to hate last minute shoppers  And tonight I had  customers that reminded me why we  do  have that right  Long day  had  call outs and a no call no show  So already its a bad day  As the manager  I agreed to work the max amount of legally allowed hours in one shift   hours  to cover the call out and take the stress off my closing crew  However it meant that I had to have us done and ready to go at closing time so that I didnt leave them alone when I had to leave  And we were on point Cue literally two minutes before lights off  Lady walks up to the sub bar  Starts demanding a snadwhich  Fine  Were technically still open  She claims its an  easy order  and then proceeds to order FIVE SUBS  Alright  we will deal  Me and my crew knock them out in five minutes and get the bar recleaned in another five  Meanwhile I run out to break down the hot bar  rotisserie chickens  baked  pieces  and fried  and get it done  scanned out and out in the trash  So far were good  last minute sub lady only put us off by  minutes As I come back from trashing the hot bar and am starting to corral my employees out of the department  this nasty old man cuts us off with his cart and asks if we have anymore rotisserie chicken  I politely tell him  Im sorry but no  The department and bar close at pm  This guy huffs and puffs and walks away We make it to the time clock and Ive literally got a minute to spare before going over  hours  While im punching out I realize that grumpy old man has followed us because the time clock is right next to the customer service desk  He loudly announces  to make sure I hear  that he has a complaint  I literally rolled my eyes at him  Im off the clock  I no longer have to play nice  He proceeds to complain to the MOD that we had the audacity to break the bar down when it was supposed to be broken down  so his late ass couldnt buy chicken  He says that he does it  all the time  and he knows we just had it sitting back there and refused to serve it to him  Im trying to sneak out and the MOD stops me  Mind you  Ive been up and going for the last  hours and I am completely beat and just want to go home because I have the morning shift tomorrow which means at this point Im lucky if I get five hours of sleep before I have to do it all over again tomorrow  So first thing I say is  Sir  as i explained  we close at   That doesnt mean    it doesnt mean    it means pm  If you want hot product  you need to be here during business hours   Guys starts to act up and MOD bless his soul turns to the guy and goes  You heard her  They close at    Guy gets pissy and storms off to do the rest of his shopping  my MOD pays for my meal  and I finally get to go home on whats closing in at  hours  start to finish  day So yes   This  is why we dislike those last minute shoppers  We are over worked and underpaid and exhausted by the end of the day  Let us go home on damn time,3473,684

207,ohkt3w,1,7,I’ll grab a box  I work convenience for a large supermarket here in the UK Little old lady comes to me  “could you help me grab some things  I want some heavy things”  I tell her certainly  yes I could help  “Ok  I’ll be back in just  minutes  I’ll go grab a box”  I didn’t think much of this  I figured she meant a basket   minutes later  She comes back to me with a perfectly formed cardboard box  for own brand caramel cones  Immediately I thought this was suspicious  so after I had helped her collect the shopping I checked the warehouse CCTV  It turns out that little old lady  aged  and    had waltzed in  grabbed a perfect cardboard box from our waste area  waltzed back out and hobbled back to the produce area where I stood waiting Who knows what kind of trouble I’d be in if she fell over in there,821,155
208,ohgrek,1,2,Is this a terrible thing to do to a retail employee  My mind is flashing back to the time that I was twenty years old and working retail  I was running the cash register and at that point had basically been told by my manager that of all the employees on staff  I did the best job at running the register because she could always count on the fact that my drawer would almost never be too terribly off and if it was  it wasnt ever too bad  One day my manager partnered me up on the register with a newer employee but first she pulled me aside and gave me strict instructions including that I wasnt to teach him ANYTHING about that register including the codes to open it  She made it out to be as if he were purely observing me only and she told me to discuss nothing with him about work and answer no questions if he started asking questions about the store  Me being autistic  literal and a strict rules follower followed her instructions to the max  I went on lunch break a few hours later and came back only for my manager to pull me and the girl who covered me for lunch off the register and into the back and lay into both of us because the drawer was off by    At this point the guy was long gone  After we both promised and swore up and down and left and right that both of us had followed her instructions to the letter and not taught that guy ANYTHING  my manager calmed down and figured out he mustve memorized the codes to the drawer just by watching us  Turns out that that particular employee had been having issues frequently where hed cover people or be on the register for breaks and when my manager would count his drawer would be off by quite a bit so she started to suspect him of theft  So apparently she decided to test her theory by partnering him up with me for a shift and seeing what happened since she could  always count on my drawer being most accurate  she figured out that if as her suspicions became correct MY drawer was off by quite a bit  then shed have her answer about whether he was stealing and thatd give her enough to let him go  Im just wondering if it was a crappy thing for her to basically use me as her own personal sting operation without telling me ahead of time  And the fact that not only did she not tell me  when my drawer was off she took me in the back and proceeded to yell at me first before hearing my side of the story   only then did she calm down and explain what happened,2441,472
209,ohdexn,1,76,How was I rude   I’m fuming right now because a customer called me “incredibly rude” and “needed to improve my work ethic”  So  And I think I said this on this thread before  but my store does not take mobile pay  And the last time a customer insisted on using mobile pay  I snapped at them   Note  our card readers are not set up to take nfc payments  and even if it was  our company will fine our store if we accept that form of payment  This time after I rung up the customers  I noticed one of them prepping their smart watch for mobile transaction  So I told them  “sorry  no mobile pay ” They take out their phone and I repeated myself  But they said this was different from mobile pay  I still told them we couldn’t accept that as a form of payment and he said “it’s a Samsung  it works like the magnetic strip of a card so it will work ” I still repeated myself “still we can’t take mobile pay”  I did look it up later and it’s not like “mobile pay” but either way we couldn’t take it  On a side note  I had no idea Samsung had that feature  I’m an apple user  He then gets mad and said “it’s not mobile pay  you are being incredibly rude  You need to better your work ethic”Finally after they pay  he request to speak to a manager  All the managers are gone for the day so I direct him to the person in charge  I didn’t bother getting close to them but I knew they were informing the person in charge about how “unprofessional” I was   Which I wasn’t  My coworker next to me heard the whole thing and after the customer left he told the person in charge they the got mad over nothing  it pisses me off when customers do not understand that WE DON’T TAKE MOBILE PAY,1693,322

212,oh3857,1,6,Do you have my dream shoes  This happened years ago  before online shopping had caught on  so we would often get customers who had unusually demanding requests It was a quiet shift in my big box store  and this customer is walking up and down the fancy shoes aisle  clearly looking for something specific  So my coworker and I approach her and ask if we can help her find anything and she says  “ok  this is going to sound weird  but I had a dream last night about this absolutely perfect pair of shoes  They were silver and they fit me so well do you guys have those shoes ” Ok  a challenge we don’t have any silver shoes  but it’s been a really boring shift so we don’t mind spending a bunch of time trying to help this woman find an alternative  We look at each other and then back at the customer and my coworker says  “um  none of our shoes are silver right now  but we have a few in gold…” and my coworker bends over to grab a pair and show the customer  This woman seems nice  albeit strange  so we’re genuinely trying to help her find an alternative to whatever she dreamt about  but she’s not giving us any actual information  so we’re just grabbing different shoes  and asking if the dream shoes had straps  a tall heel  were they sparkly  And she keeps telling us the shoes are wrong  but not giving any descriptions or details except that they need to be silver and that they were very  very pretty and perfect  She’s becoming less fun now  as she seems genuinely annoyed that we aren’t producing the “dream shoes”  So we start kind of hinting that we’ve now shown her every type of fancy shoe we have and she says  “You must have them you have everything ” And she starts going down the aisle  pulling out shoes from our surprisingly well organized shelves  that clearly aren’t silver  and asking us if we have them in silver in another aisle  She’s pointing at the shoe boxes of overstock  which are arranged in a particular order  not related at all to what’s displayed on the shelf underneath  and insisting we pull them down and show her that they aren’t silver heels   Because we secretly have the most amazing silver heels  we’ve just chosen to hide them in a deranged Willy Wonka style treasure hunt for our own amusement 🙄  We finally give up trying to help her  but we can’t go far  because she’s now trying on random pairs of shoes and getting visibly upset that they aren’t what she wants  She asks us for help again  insisting that we check the back  call another store  and show her what is in practically every box up top  After some more irritating back and forth  explaining to her that we truly do not have the shoes she’s looking for  as she’s continuing to try on more shoes  leaving a growing pile of them on the floor out of spite  we finally suggest to her that maybe one of the shoe stores in the mall has some silver heels  She sighs  and says the mall is too expensive  accepts that we don’t have the mystery shoes she dreamt about and leaves,2987,545

214,ogza9x,1,30,The Most Surreal Customer Ive Experienced I recently found out about this sub  and so I thought Id share one of my craziest stories I experienced in my opinion  This happened fairly recently  at least a month ago  For context I work for one of the big companies as a cashier  I also havent worked there for very long and am still fairly new  This occurred when I was on self checkout  It was fairly busy and I was by myself for a bit running around trying to help everyone  we usually have  people  I forgot why I was by myself   One lady caught my attention to let me know that the older woman next to her needed my help  Now  sometimes we get people who dont know how to use the self scan  and I have no qualms about helping teach them how to use it  Well  when I get over to her shes immediately freaking out and talking at mph  Shes saying things like   Im from City and I dont have time to learn this   and  Can you just do this for me   Immediately I know that this woman is going to be a handful and cause problems if I make the wrong move  so I just agree to help her scan her items  Luckily at this point a coworker had come over to help other people while I helped this lady Once I started to scan her things  shes very happy  She starts talking at me and Im half listening as Im doing all this for her  I catch a few things like how shes telling me that Im the greatest and how she loves me  Just showering me in praises and also talking about her life and family  Well that all didnt last too long when I hit a snag  The next thing I know I look up at the screen and its telling me to insert the coupon into the slot  This prevents me from scanning more items  I dont know how it happened  but I knew what to do  We have a piece of cardboard we use to push down coupons when the slot gets full to get past the sensor  I try to explain to the lady I need to get the cardboard because I cant scan anything else until I fix the issue  and that Ill be right back  Immediately  like flipping a switch  shes freaking out again   Youre leaving me    So what youre going to be gone for like  hours   Basically accusing me of abandoning her  I promise her that Ill be back in like  seconds and that seems to placate her  so I rush to get the cardboard and go back Once I was back she fell right back into how she was earlier  praising me and telling me about her life  Im once again half listening as Im working when she tells me she doesnt want to buy some bread she had in her cart  I let her know again Ill be right back to put the bread in the cart we use for unwanted items people leave there  Once again she freaks out that Im abandoning her  I quickly put the bread away and come back to her once again flipping the switch and being all friendly and nice again  This time I remember her talking to me about celebrities and how they all have diseases  She also mentions Bill Gates divorce and how she hopes I meet him and marry him   I finally finish up helping her and she thanks me and leaves  I was EXHAUSTED  Part of me was also feeling like I had just been played  like there was no way someone like that could actually exist in real life  Whether real or a joke Im just glad I havent seen her since,3262,637

221,ofmflb,1,1,Discrimination This is Covid related so Im not sure if itll be allowed  but I wanted to share this comment a customer made yesterday Back last year my province made wearing masks inside mandatory and my store  obviously  followed suit  We were told that no exemptions were allowed A guy came in  we told him about the no mask  no service rule and he was really smart about his response  telling us we were discriminating against him because of his illness  He used the proper buzzwords that made it impossible for us to argue our new rule   I spoke to my manager about it and it came down the pike that it wasnt up to us to explain or justify the rule  simply to enforce it  He stopped coming in  waited outside while someone shopped for him  Recently  the mandate ended and masks are now  Recommended   He came in yesterday and ignored me the entire time  from my greeting to finishing the transaction  At the very last moment  he said   Thanks for not discriminating against me   I just looked at him My dude  my guy   First  no one was discriminating against you for your so called illness that prevented you from masking up  I was simply enforcing a rule I was told to enforce   as a means of protecting myself and my coworkers  Secondly  the mandate is over  Even if I disagree with it or feel uncomfortable with people not being masked in the store  theres nothing I can do about it,1406,250

224,of3ba9,1,25,My first complaint  So I have worked at a small woman owned company for three years  We downsized because of COVID and only have three employees so we regularly work alone  Today during the peak hours there were about  woman shopping and me running around trying to appease everyone  One woman walked in and I missed her and didn’t greet her  Apparently this is a huge issue for her  As she is checking out she passively mentioned how we used to be friendlier which I just brushed off as there was a line behind her  At the end she asked for my associate number and someone to contact  I said “we don’t have associate numbers  there are three employees but I can give you my name and you can call the store tomorrow when the manager is working”  She said fine and left  I then texted my manager to except a complaint about me and why and she asked for the customers name so she could ignore the call  I am all about complaining when an associate is actually being a jerk but a missed greeting feels like a waste of everyone’s time and effort,1045,196

233,odhyqw,1,83,I calculated it myself so the register is wrong First post so I hope Im doing it right  English is not my native language  amp  xB So earlier this year I started working in a local grocery store so when this story happend i was still fairly new to everything and i wasnt wearing a headset at the time so if something were to happen id have to ask a colleague to call someone  Also we have extra screens that show the costumers the items that are scanned and their total and the registers are shared by two people facing away from eachother I already new the Lady this story is about  because the first time she was at my register she snatched the receipt out of my hand telling me to just put it down  So when I saw her in the line to my register again i knew i had to make everything perfect  She comes up and i start scanning her items  on a side note  she bought  cans of cat food haha and some other stuff  and i tell her the total  She looks at the screen  then looks at me and says that it cant be because she calculated it and the register is wrong  She then proceeds to recalculate the items in her head  probs to her i couldnt do this  and tells me the total she comes up with which is about € less  Im kinda lost since  you know  if the register tells me the price i cant change anything about it In comes the manager of the evening who backs me up  after checking if I did everything right  The Lady still says it cant be and recalculates at least three more time  Asking for the mamager not knowing she is already there  the asking for someone higher up  it was late the manager was the highest person in the store   Inbetween she tells us she is going to take the receipt with her and she wants to have it  Me and the manager tell her she can have the reiceipt but she has to pay first  She actually took so much time with complaining and recaculating and everything  that another costumer in line offerd to pay the diffrence  She finally decides to pay  once again snatching the receipt out of my hand and she leaves  That was already a wild ride for me because she was the first really rude costumer I had but you know it happens  I know that now  But the story doesnt end here  because the next time i work she comes up to my register from the oustide of the store  she wasnt shopping and came directly to me   I was scanning another costumers items and told her to wait and i was already looking for a way to get someone to help me if she gets rude again  since i wasnt wearing a headphone thing and i was alone in the register both   But I got a really pleasant surprise because she came up to alpologise to me  that infact she calculated wrong and the register was right and then she proceeds to tell me her life story  which i cut short  other costumers were waiting   And now everytime I work and she is in the store she comes to my register and is actually rather nice now,2916,559

241,oakybo,1,22,Glitch in the matrix      Another poster writing about what they couldnt control for the customer reminded me of this exchange  earlier this summer Working at a fine auto waystation with a Car Spa  car wash  its a little car wash  we get some people get confused as to how buying a wash is supposed to work         You can pay three ways You can drive right up to the machine kiosk and use your credit card  but  only  your credit card and it can be a little tricky Most people either like to pay inside by cash  or they pay at the pump while theyre getting gas        This is easier and then theyre given a code number on their receipt to enter at the kiosk  which will start their car wash The other day  an already inconvienced old man came to counter to say that his receipt didnt print out and therefore he didnt get his car wash that he had paid for        This happens commonly enough that I know well that I can just call up the pump transaction on the register and reprint his receipt with his car wash code on it        Naturally  the first thing I ask him is  what pump   is he at He replies  Nine     and repeats that number consistantly as we transaction tango        The reason for the song and dance was  I wasnt getting any readout from pump          Now  this can happen too  sometimes the network is slow  or sometimes its just a glitch in the matrix        Whatever  he was getting more and more upset that his car washing wants werent being instantly gratified    and that was MY fault of course         Regardless that I couldnt make the network connect any faster  he was going to send in a complaint and stormed off to his car in protest Now  it wasnt to busy so I looked out the window after him and noticed something strange  there was NO car at pump   and irate old man was headed to pump   Well then  I called up the screen to pump   and there was his car wash code        Printing it up  I even had a trainee run out there and give it to him  but he was still determined to be cranky Some people,2058,430

244,o9c5eu,1,15,Much ado about serial numbers When I was working at a thrift store  I got this one customer who was quite   odd   Well call her  Monica    She comes to the register to check out and I make some small talk and she puts her stuff on the counter   Monicas total comes to about   and she fishes out a five and asks if she could make a partial payment and come back later to pay the rest   I told her no  shes dressed like she could be homeless or something    She then takes out a tiny stack of ones and asks to borrow a pen and a piece of paper so I oblige I then notice that Monica is writing down the serial numbers to all the one dollar bills she was using to pay   This raised an immediate red flag so I ushered my Awesome Supervisor  AS  to the cash wrap   AS takes a closer look at Monica and asks her why she was writing down the serial numbers on a piece of paper   Monica replies that it would be  proof  that she didnt steal anything   Eventually  after writing down the serial numbers to the money  I take the cash as payment but only before I checked them for counterfeits per AS   I cashed out Monica and she went on her way  mumbling something about having to pay to get her clothes back or something AS then told me that she thought it might have been money laundering  I doubt it but it could happen   I then told AS that Monica writing down all those serial numbers wouldnt do anything because we would be giving that money away as change and her efforts would be worthless,1499,294

248,o93qc2,1,102,My one sided war with a customer over a bag To start  this is absolutely petty on my part  And I wont pretend it isnt I have a particular customer who comes in and gets  smaller items  Usually when its like this I dont default to asking if they need a bag  This customer stands there and waits until I ask them if I need a bag and they shrug and say   Sure   dismissively  Like they werent waiting for one and for me to ask I started recognizing the behavior from the customer and a couple of times if they came in  Id just go and grab the bag without asking and theyd say   Nah I dont need it   and leave  Even if they waited a minute  So I started getting annoyed about why they wouldnt ask for a bag  If I asked  theyd take it  If I didnt ask but grabbed the bag they wouldnt  But if I never asked or grabbed a bag  theyd wait  I was convinced they were messing with me So instead of being a normal person and just continuing to ask them for a bag  today I wanted to stretch the limit They came up to the counter when no one else was in the store and got a bottle of soda and a pack of gum and once they were rung up and paid  I waited  I washed the counter a bit  started stocking behind the counter and they just    waited  On their cellphone looking up occasionally  I started sorting stuff and cleaning up and they stayed there I broke after about  minutes and asked them if they needed a bag and they just shrugged and said   Sure  My white flag is out and Im just gonna keep asking them for a bag,1533,296
249,o8w2lh,1,0,Picking Up A Soaked Chair From A Hoarder  Where I use to work  my store delivered furniture  This was several years ago  We had a couple who bought a power reclining chair from us  and later the wife claimed there were sparks coming from the motor  So me and a coworker were tasked with picking up the chair from the customers place  and bringing it back to the store for the workers in the store to look it over  When we get there  it was a property in a trailer park  and their trailer was surrounded by garbage  Lots of old lawn equipment  long uncut grass  You get the picture  It gets worse  We enter the trailer  and what you see in hoarder documentaries are real  Stacks of news paper  garbage everywhere  The place had cats and dogs  smelled of urine and feces  Me and my coworker move over to the chair  It smelled a lot like urine  The man who sat in it was over weight  walked with a cane  so he had mobility issues  We move to disassemble the chair  and as I’m taking apart the back  I notice a stain on the floor that at first I thought was melted chocolate  But then I noticed there were fragments of toilet paper in it  I still hope it wasn’t what I thought it was  but it probably was  We get the chair into the vehicle  and as soon as we are in  my coworker happened to be carrying a little bottle of disinfected  We covered our hands  and used gloves to remove the chair from vehicle when we got back to the store  The people who looked over the chair sprayed that things multiple times with cleaners  They figured the guy who would sit in that chair was literally going to the bathroom in the chair  and the urine was soaking through the chair  and then dripping onto the motor  and that’s what was causing sparks  I don’t know what they told the customer  but we returned a week later to return the chair to the customer  This time  me and my coworker wore gloves  and still used disinfectant when we were done,1947,365

263,o7nomx,1,108,Regulars Tear Up Store Over A TV Remote I work at a convenience store type place  we have a small spot where customers can drink beer and there’s a TV there    of the people who hang out in there are generally regulars  folks who go in everyday for the last  or  hours were open  They are very obsessive with the TV  Well  Friday the remote got stolen  Friday night they come in and I tell them remotes gone  TVs not even on because I turned it off since the remote got snatched  Had to stand on a damn counter just to reach the buttons   Clearly they didn’t believe me because every one of them came up to me separately asking for the remote  It’s gone  It’s stolen  I can’t just magic up a new remote  Saturday they are upset because I’m “lying” and just “hiding the remote from them” because I don’t want the TV on  I only have it shut off at night when I’ve people coming in to watch tv but are t buying anything  So  they clearly did the logical thing to solve this problem  They started searching the store  They went into the kitchen  they went behind the counting for that room  where we keep single beers and some important stuff   They went into the dry storage area  They went into the fucking  managers office  and rummaged through her stuff to find the remote  They ignored me when I said they can’t be back there because “I’m hiding the remote from them”  Of course they were allowed to go into those places  They spent more time in the store than some of the employees so they get to do what they want  right  Plus the owner loves them  she wouldn’t mind them searching her office  I went into their drinking room and announced to ALL the customers that anyone who goes into employee areas will be asked to leave immediately  got a few arguments and then I added I will contact the police if an individual refuses to leave  That got them to stop  I don’t think they understood the remote was   gone   until yesterday when I had to scold a few of them for doing that on my coworkers shift a couple days later and  remind them they can not only get kicked out but banned if they keep doing that These were multiple full grown   y o adults,2171,406
264,o7mcze,1,1,The bomb scare and the windows   In the midd ’s I worked for a large retail company in the North East of the UK  this was the time when the IRA where in full operation I worked in head office  one of the stores there had a position on the end of the street with three sides to it and large glass display windows all round  about  feet up was a canopy that went right around the end of the building and out about  out from the building Both stores where joined by a tunnel under the road between them as the other store was on the opposite side of one of the streets  Both stores had a basement and  floors So this day we get a bomb threat that there is a bomb in one of the stores  so all customers are escorted out the stores followed by the staff Once outside I stood with my back to the wall away from the windows so if there was a bomb and it went off I was in a safe place  the rest of the staff where all over the place in front of the windows I asked my fellow staff members to stand in the area I was in and told them if there was a bomb then the windows could be blown out and glass would fly every where and injure any one in front of the windows  Which they did One of the sales men was a good friend and I called him over to me  he asked why I called him  and then explained the situation to him and he joined us I was a false alarm there was no bomb   months later we had the same thing again  another bomb scare but this time when you went outside the building there was no one next to the windows  they where standing in safe zones or had walked up the street away from the buildings It would seam that word had got around the stores about staying away from the windows  and yes another false alarm  this happened about  times in total When people heard that it was me saying the windows could blow outwards I had quite a few pats on my back for that information from staff members The store was Binns Limited in Sunderland,1972,386

266,o779tp,1,72,She made me buy the candy bar and I hate candy   This was back when I was working at my local grocery store  It was in a lower income part of town if that helps set the scene in any way Our store was having a bit of a promotional  Everytime someone bought something a   off coupon would print out with the receipt  It was one coupon per customer per order and they had to spend at least   before the coupon would even go through Well one day this older gentleman walks up to the cash register with his little handful of items  It all rings up to about     He then hands me the   off coupon  The following conversation went a bit like this M  oh sorry i cant use that right now  You have to have at least   worth of stuff before that can go through  Is there anything else you want G  no this is it  I dont want anything else  Just use the coupon M  i cant use it until you reach    We sell bags for    if you want some of those G  no i dont want any bags  I just want what i have and for you to use the coupon  Now i know i could have probably just charged him for the bags so the coupon would go through  but i hate charging people for things that they dont end up taking with them  Slightly feels like stealing  So i decided to try some other things  M  how about one of the candy bars  Itll be enough to push you over   G   huffs and grabs the closest candy bar and hands it to me M   scans the candy and coupon  He ends up being    over  Transaction proceeds as normal minus the grumpy attitude of the dude  G   after recieving change proceeds to chuck it into the back of the room  I dont like chocolate bars The guy rants about it to himself for a minute before my supervisor came over to ask what was wrong  He told her that i wouldnt use his coupon and that i forced him to buy candy and he doesnt even like it  She then turns to me and tells me i should have just charged him for bags,1938,376

268,o6r6gz,1,1,Lady  probably  broke out of mental hospital and tries to take me home This happened today  literally a few hours ago and Im still a bit shaky tbh So for a little bit of context  this lady apparently tried to buy a few items before my interaction with her  She went through self scan and apparently didnt have enough money to pay for her stuff  so she said she was going to go to the gas station to get money from their ATM  theres a bank literally right next door from us with an ATM   She came back an hour later and loaded up her carriage with more stuff  and then came to the front  She started scanning her new groceries and came up to me wondering where the items she didnt pay for last time were  I had no idea what she was talking about because I wasnt there an hour ago  She pointed to one of the self scans and said she left them  right there   and when I asked her when that was she said  about an hour ago   I thought it was strange that she would assume her groceries would stay at the same self scan for a WHOLE HOUR  but didnt think much else of it  I found her suspended order on another register and brought her the bag Me  Are these your items L     Im so confused Me     Are these not yours  You said it was Ritz Crisps and thats whats in the bag L     Theres items missing Me  There are  Well  whats missing L     Im so confused I look at the suspended order slip and sure enough  all the stuff on the slip are in the bag  I tell her this  and she repeats  I am so confused   and then says its fine  she doesnt want them anymore and goes back to scanning her groceries  Ok  whatever As shes scanning her groceries  my manager comes up to me asks if the  woman in the white nightgown  is still here  I didnt really notice what this woman was wearing  but once he asked me that I was like  huh  that lady was wearing something strange  wasnt she   I look at her  and yep  thats her Anyway  she pays for her stuff and starts to leave  L  Thank you so much  honey Me  Oh  youre welcome L  Now  are you gonna go home with me Me  Haha  no  I gotta stay here  I have a lot of work to do Lady     So youre not coming home with me Me  still thinking shes joking   Nah  they need me too much over here Lady  Im being serious  You dont need to stay here  you can come home with me  Lets go Me  Y You are  Um  its fine  really  I still have a long ways to go of my shift Lady  What time are you here until  Ill come pick you up Me     Im here all night Lady  All night Me  Yep   all  night She keeps asking me what time Im working until  and I keep responding with a jokingly cheerful  Im here all night   praying to GOD shed just leave  She makes a weirdly threatening comment along the lines of  Well I really hope you are here all night  then   Then she gets quiet and stares at me  An unblinking  see through your soul stare  Now Im really starting to get nervous  so I tell her to have a good night and walk away to do work  She continues to stare at me for  like  three minutes  and then goes up to a hand sanitizer pump and starts pumping hand sanitizer into her hand while staring at me unflinchingly  Two coworkers of mine saw our interaction and theyre keeping an eye on the woman  I start thinking  Im going to give her one more minute  and if she doesnt leave by then then Im going to call someone to remove her from the store   Thankfully she FINALLY leaves  I go up to the two coworkers who saw the interaction and they were like  Wtf  do you know her    apparently one of them thought I knew her because of how I handled it  lol  But yeah  because Im really bad at noticing what people wear  they inform me that she wasnt wearing a  nightgown  but a HOSPITAL GOWN  and apparently even a hospital bracelet I mean  I could be wrong  Maybe she got released  but I dont think they would release her wearing the hospital gown  And she definitely wasnt  um  well enough to be released  Anyway  that was definitely the scariest customer interaction I ever had  But I feel sorry for her  shes not ready to be out in public like that  Apparently a customer told the manager that they were going to call the police but I dont know if they did I told a few other employees the story and they were all like   was it the woman in the hospital gown   I have  no idea  how I didnt notice she was in a hospital gown  I hope she gets the help she needs,4453,822
269,o6n21z,1,106,Woman tries to have me arrested for stopping HER from shoplifting I  F  work at a large craft retail store and it was almost closing time  I was at a register waiting for stragglers to check out  and had my back towards the exit  which is right behind the registers  There was nobody coming up  so I was looking around  and I noticed a woman walking quickly behind me towards the exit  By the time I saw her she was already turning towards the doors and walking into the foyer which leads to the outside entrance  and I only saw her back and a little of her side  enough that I noticed her arms were crossed over her chest like she was holding something against it  I didnt much of it  just yelled  have a good night     I guess she was so focused on getting out of the store she didnt notice me standing there  so when I spoke to her she startled really badly and dropped what she was holding  It was a little vase that cost like  dollars  So immediately I walked towards her out into the foyer  I dont know why she stayed there  she could have just booked it and I wouldnt have followed her  and I asked her if she was planning to pay for the vase  kind of in a snarky way  but it was late and I was too tired for this bullcrap   She got huffy and said yes  so I picked up the vase to bring it to my register and check her out  I dont know if that set her off or what  but she suddenly got PISSED and snatched the vase away from me  She said  I PAID for this  and then started talking some bull about my dirty paws being all over her property  I already knew what this was gonna turn into  so I went to the registers and picked up a phone and paged for my manager  A couple of my coworkers came up to the registers and she started talking to them about how I had tried to steal her property and accused her of shoplifting  and yelled at her  They all knew she was lying already because Im a very quiet  shy person  and Ive never raised my voice let alone yelled at someone at work  The lady started telling my coworkers to call the cops  and also started saying that I had physically cornered her and that she was afraid for her life  Now this woman was tall and pretty broad  and Im average height thin  so shes a good   inches taller than me and much bigger besides height  Theres no way I could have intimidated her that much  My coworkers and I just let her carry on until my manager got there  and it turned out that he had been suspicious of her earlier and had been checking the cameras  When she tried to start her bullcrap on him about having me arrested and stuff  he already knew she didnt pay for anything and told her to leave and stop harassing his employees  She told him that she would be calling cooperate  he said go ahead  and she stormed out after that  The kicker of this whole thing was that she was wearing what seemed like expensive clothes and nice jewelry  and when we watched her leave it was in a car that looked pretty new expensive  And she was trying to steal and make a big fuss over a little  dollar vase  When she obviously has the money to afford many of them  I hate customers like this,3149,607
270,o6gzl7,1,2,Things like this just leave a bad taste in my mouth  I work for the company that employs electricians for small jobs  Part of  my job is to answer the phone  take their information  type a quick  summary of the job  and then open the work order for the electrician   which they will then use to contact the client and do the requested  work  Its summer  and the guy who does the billing is on vacation  which means I get to answer a second phone and write invoices for simple jobs  to ease his workload when he gets back I get to work  and phone starts ringing  A client introduces himself and wishes to talk about a invoice he received  about work that was done earlier this month  As he is giving me the information  I pull out the information about the invoice in question  The job our company did seemed pretty straightforward  air conditioning system  with a thermostat So I ask   What seems to be the problem  He starts  by telling me   The amount hours done by your electricians  does not match to the amount that being billed and there are some items on the invoice that were not used during the installation  This does happen sometimes  I ask that he lists all the items that were not used  and so that I can correct the bill  by double checking with our electrician  After listing all the items  I ask him  And what about the hours  He answers   I did most of the preparations myself  and your electrician only had to do the coupling of the thermostat and the motor that runs the air conditioner   He does give me his estimate  for how much he thinks he should be billed about the work done  The amount is nowhere near what our electrician reported after finishing the job This is getting more and more complicated  so I inform him that I will be contacting the electrician  who was at the scene  and our boss about these inaccuracies  and that I would be contacting him after getting all the information After few calls and and some digging through our filing cabinet  I finally have some context  Apparently The client had visited our location when the work order was written and he was given an estimate about all the costs  work and material costs included  which he had agreed to  As per an agreement  the invoice was sent to reflect that amount  Though what he failed to mention during his phone call with me  was that the electrician was not informed about his homemade wiring work  So our electrician had to double check  which after doing so  had to redo some of the wiring  The electrician also told me  that the client had basically been breathing down his neck the whole tiime  slowing his work After talking with my boss  I was told to remove the items he claimed were not used  which were nowhere to be seen in our shop  and our electrician was confident that they were actually used during the installation  The hours that were billed however  were another story Apparently the hours electrician had reported  after finishing the job  were already  adjusted  so that we were able to meet the estimate  which the client had agreed upon  I was told that I could reduce the hours on the invoice by one  but no more than that So I do some calculating  and redo the whole invoice  I can already tell that the phonecall is not going to go over well with the client I call him  explaining the amount amount he agreed to  when he made the work order  I was actually waiting for him to get angry  maybe even vent his frustration  but he sounded dejected   This is just speculation on my part now  but he sounded more sad than angry That phone call lasted for about  minutes  He tried to make his case about all the preparation he had done  and how that should count for something  I informed him that we were willing to go under the agreed amount by removing the few items from the invoice and reduce the hours by one  but that was it  We had his signature on the paperwork and even doing this much is more than we would usually be willing to do So he tells me how he heard that our company was fair  and how our services were recommended to him because of that  At the end he told me that he would never recommend our services to anyone  and how disappointed he was about all this  I didnt really know what to say to him after all that  so the phone call ended after I simply told him that the revised invoice would be mailed to him  in a week or so,4399,797

273,o5tti4,1,4,Never Satisfied Customer Heres a retail story  but also Im asking for advice Ive been working for this ice cream shop for about  years now  In the first year  one day  I was working drive thru  I was taking this ladys order  but she was being complicated  She asked for two strawberry smoothies with extra sugar  wtf   I dont know whatever  I repeated her order and she cut me off saying  I didnt say banana   Thing is I didnt say banana either  I repeated her order twice exactly what she was telling me  but she was telling me thats not what she ordered  I was over it so I just told her  okay Ill have your amount at the window   Shes at the window now I take her money hand out her smoothies and shes upset C Customer Me MeC   Wheres the whipped cream  Me   Sorry you didnt ask for whipped cream C   No  I come here all the time  your smoothies come with whipped cream and a cherry  whip cream is an add on  its not included for any of our smoothies  also I worked   hours a week  first time Ive encountered her Me   Whipped cream would be an extra charge C   Wheres your manager Me   Im the manager C   No I want to speak to someone else Well  luckily  the night manager came in for night shift  I was done with her so I asked him to talk to her  This is where I became very upset  which I dont know still till this day if I was wrong to feel so upset about it  Well he talked to her  he remade her items and he sent her out with coupons for free desserts  for the trouble   She didnt deserve any coupons  I gave her exactly what she order  The most we should have done for her was remaking the smoothies and adding whipped cream with no charge  just to get her out of there  But not free desserts   I expect coworkers to have each others backs when the customer is in the wrong  Not throw them under the bus This happened ish years ago  I left the company for a few months  When I came back I only worked   hours a week every other week or really month  Then at the beginning of this year I decided to add more hours   hrs  About a month ago I saw her again  I didnt recognizer her  but I recognized her order  She was at our front window this time so I saw my coworkers handing out her items  She sent her items back to be remade  She just looked at them  said there isnt enough of anything in them  She ended up asking for a manager  she talked to another manager on shift  My coworker remade her smoothie TWICE before she was happy with it  After she left I started talking about the incident I had with her  years ago  My coworker told me they have to make her order over every time she comes  I told my coworker that  that needs to stop  Its a waste of our time and our product Now to the end of the story Cut to last night  Once again I noticed her order on the screen  If she was going to complain  we werent going to remake anything  She either takes it as is or we give her her money back and she gets nothing  Well I was telling my coworkers this when I was watching a different coworker hand out her order  She ended up asking for a manager  a coworker who has worked for the company longer than me stepping up trying to help her  She didnt want to talk to him asked for someone else so he gave her the GM managers name  She left  we didnt have to remake anything  yay  I asked him what she wanted a manager for     He said she was accusing me of calling her dirty word     What word     The customers are outside while we are inside handing out orders through windows  So she cant hear anything that was said if it was said He said she came the night before as well and he had the same problems  He was going to notify the GM about her  So what advice would you give to handle this lady in the correct way  Is refusing service an extreme to this situation,3853,721

278,o4a7cf,1,51,you shouldn’t have put your head there my store has an automatic sliding door just like a grocery store  at close we power it off so it won’t open automatically but we can’t lock the door until all the customers leave because that’s illegal in my state  last night i go power off the door at close and go have the cashier that isn’t currently ringing up customers ring me up  we hear knocking on the door so i look over and a customer is making the praying sign with his hand and begging to come in  since it’s after close i legally don’t have to let him in so i tell the cashier i’m going to ignore him  this man then pries open the doors and walks in begging for me to let him shop  now if i wasn’t going to help you before  why would you breaking into the store after close make me want to help you more  i rush over to the man pointing to the door and say “sir you need to leave right now  we are closed and you just pried open the doors that were powered off” he starts backing up out the door still begging for me to “make a special exception for him” as if i know him and think he’s special  i see the man exit the store so i turn towards the edge of the door and slam it shut only to hear the man exclaim “you just slammed the door on my head ” i look at the man dumbfounded and his whole body is outside the door but he is leaned forward so that his head is squished between the door  my first though was to say “well you shouldn’t have put your head there” but i was too speechless at this customers stupidity  you would think that someone would keep their body out of the way of a door someone is closing  he then exclaimed “wow you’re not even sorry ” and pulled his head out and scurried off  i honestly don’t know what he was thinking,1749,349

283,o3bwa0,1,42,Some people are just never happy This was back at the very beginning of the pandemic  Social distancing and masks had been required for a few weeks to a month I think  My store had changed from multiple lines to only one line with social distancing  We didn’t have plexiglass yet and could only have  registers open  I was on first register and my coworker on the other  Both of us were trying to get through the line and go as fast as we could with transactions  But people kept coming in  so the line was still very long and slow  My coworker left the register for a few minutes to take care of some important thing that I don’t remember now  It was just us two and the managers  all of the managers were busy  By the time the customer got to my line  it looked like I was the only person working  So  like any normal human being would do  he yelled at me for being slow  He complained for  minutes about the line being too long and too slow  He kept saying he knew I was trying  but it was still unacceptable  Now  I’m not the slowest cashier  I’m pretty fast and get most people in and out if they’re willing  He was not willing The irony of him complaining about me wasting time with each customer at the register and holding the line up… while he was wasting time and holding the line up to complain about it  It still frustrates me  He took so long yelling at me and kept going even after multiple apologies and thanking him for his patience  that I started scanning his items while listening to him ramble  When he finally stopped ranting  I asked him if he had a rewards number  There were problems with his rewards number and it took a few minutes of back and forth with it  Basically he was missing information for his account Without going into too much detail  he mumbled a lot  so I needed him to repeat himself a couple of times  And he ended up saying the famous line “I’ve been coming here for  years and pay good money here ”  Which is weird because I had worked there for almost a year at that point in time and never saw him once  And if he truly had been a regular to any of our stores  there wouldn’t have been any missing information for his account  After finally fixing his rewards account so that he could get like   saved  he glared into my soul and said “See  You did something wrong ” And left  My coworker returned and I called the next person in line  The next person was so sweet  She said so many nice things  like that the previous guy was a jerk and that she wanted to let me know that I did a great job  That’s when I couldn’t hold back the tears in my eyes  I had my coworker cover for me and had a power cry in the break room for about  minutes  I got back to work and pretended nothing had ever happened I’m still working there and have never seen that guy return,2824,539
284,o377it,1,35,Customer threatens to call police on me because I cannot refund a phone minute card I have been a longtime lurker  and after six years of working in the same store  I have plenty of stories  So many  However  the one that I would like to start sharing with you is a simple one  although one that makes me want to punch many walls out of pure frustration I work in a small general store  Ive been at this particular store six years  I have been a key holding manager five  and I have been assistant manager for over a year  Needless to say  I have seen and experienced some shit  But  this  This isnt the craziest  but hooboy  its seared in my memory of one of the most annoying shifts I have ever worked Its our busiest day of the week  and I have been at the store since six am and I have just gotten off of break at  noon   I promise this is important  Remember this   As soon as I walk out  my cashier looks at me and goes   Hey  I have an issue with a return and Im not sure what to do   No problem  Shes developing a line  so I instruct the customer with the return to move to my register so I can help him while the cashier continues to check out the customers waiting in line  This is something that happens often  and Im chill with it  I would rather take care of it myself than have someone who isnt sure how to proceed deal with it  If we were slower  Id have them watch me to learn  but as its busy      Ill just take care of it and move on Its the Saturday before Memorial Day  and my plan was to start setting up displays of grilling supplies  cases of water  our Memorial Day flowers  etc  Things people would be looking for during the week to prep for the weekend  Alas  I had no idea I would be spending the next two and a half hours of my shift dealing with this customer He and his wife are both regulars  and they are the kind of customers that when they come in  you know theres going to be an issue  They believe they are entitled to anything they cook up in their little heads  and if they dont get their way  the threats come out  Theyre just     exhausting  They are also far too familiar with our return policy  A policy I say every time we sell something that could pose an issue  or is a special case  Like cellphones  Sir is here with a cellphone return  Ah  the headaches  Here they come He has bought a the issuing company cellphone for his  birthday   and it will not work  He explains that he had activated it  but it states there is no SIM card  Im like  alright  lets see if I can just fix the issue without having to process the return  Customer has a working phone  and everyone is happy  I go through his settings  and sure enough  I get a pop up  No SIM card detected  Open the phone  SIM card is there  Maybe inserted wrong  I take it out  make sure its right and put it back in  No SIM card detected  Okay  cool  I explain to him that I do not have another phone like this in stock right now  and he demands a refund  Coolio I start the return  which deactivates the phone   and he informs me that he also wants a return on the minutes he bought for that phone  I explain that I cannot process that return  and that it says so on the receipt  I show him  and this    is when it starts to get loud  There are about ten people in line currently  and seven of them are behind him when he raises his voice and says   If you wont give me my money back  Ill just call the police  Theyll get me my money back    Hindsight is    I shouldve just told him to call  Wouldve saved me some time  lmao   I start to talk to him  he just talks over me louder  demanding that I give him his money back  I try one more time with the most polite voice I can muster  and once again   I am calling the police right NOW   Sir  if you would calm down for one second and listen to me  you would understand that I am trying to help you solve this issue  Would you like me to call the issuing company to see if we can fix the phone so that there is no issue to be had  Sudden attitude change  Probably because I damn near had to yell it to be heard over his tomfoolery  He obliges me and I go outside to call the issuing company  We have to reactivate the phone  Fine  cool  Shoot a message to my Store Manager to let her know my till will be short  but the money doesnt exist since the return was never processed  I just needed to reactivate the phone through our system  Cool  We good  Try to reactivate his phone   One hour has passed  My relief has arrived as well as the night cashier by now  also important   Sir bothers me the entire time about how long its going to take  I inform him that he can either wait or take the phone and deal with the issuing company himself  He chooses to wait  Duh  Still no luck  I explain to him that theyre trying to reset the connection with the towers  Wait thirty minutes  turn the phone off  and try to make a call  He nods and leaves Freedom                  Not quite Thirty minutes later  Sir is back  He claims it still isnt working  Alright  did you turn it off and back on like I instructed you  No  Okay  we do that  Still doesnt work  I inform him there is nothing more I can do for him  that he needs to call the issuing company himself and get it sorted  Once again he starts to raise his voice  and I cut him off   Sir  I have been attempting to fix this issue for you for two hours now  it is time for me to go home  I  Cannot  Help  You  You need to contact the issuing company   He reluctantly shuffles away Only for his son to come back in the next day and tell me he needs a new SIM card  Something I would have suggested had the man given me time to speak  I sell him the SIM card for a dollar  and what dya know  It works  How amazing  Sir comes back in because he forgot all of his phone accessories  and I give him the bag  He thanks me for being a big help  and here is where    I maybe get a little facetious because I respond with   Of course  no problem  But  next time  I will not help you if you threaten to call the police on me ever again  He claims he only threatened that because  that boy  aka my night cashier got an attitude with him  I pause  stare at him for a moment before replying   Sir  when you threatened me with that  he wasnt even here  His shift did not start until   and he was not in the building until    Just have a good day  alright   He didnt respond  and I went back to work  Which I know sounds very   whatever but its an approximation of what I said  Remember  I came off of my break at   and I remember being outside on the phone with the issuing company when my night cashier walked through the doors  The only thing he said to Sir was to ask him to please stop making a scene inside the store because I was outside actively trying to get his phone to work   I have no cell service inside my work building  therefore I had to be outside to take care of everything so that my store phone would remain open for customer calls  And  Im still just so confused as to how he thought the cops were going to get his money back when the receipt clearly stated  NOT VALID FOR RETURNS  REFUNDS  TRANSFERS  AND HAS NO CASH VALUE underneath the PIN number I swear I love my job  Maybe Ill be back with some of the other craziness Ive experienced  Like the crazy clothes thief  the battery thieves dumb enough to tell me they were banned from another store  or perhaps the two people who tried to get me fired  Oh  Theres also the drunk naked lady that accused me of hitting on her boyfriend  While I was stocking charcoal  Fun times  gt  Editted to remove some identifying info I forgot to censor   amp  xB,7694,1463
285,o32dem,1,38,The fitting rooms are closed for a reason  So  I work in a big brand clothing chain  but a smaller store  Today  I was asked to tidy around an area of my shop  and this area is known for being the messiest and having dumped stock all over it because its home to the best mirror  As I started tidying everything away  my manager came over to me and started to tell me that shed just spotted two women who used to go into her old shop all the time and swap the tags from cheaper garments onto more expensive ones so that theyd get what they wanted for significantly cheaper  She pointed them out and asked me to keep an eye  which was easy because they were at the mirror every  seconds  I carried on tidying the area when another woman  lets call her Pam  came over to the mirror and started trying clothes up against herself  Now  its important to note  we have intermittently had our fitting rooms open  provided the shop is not busy and there are ample staff to keep on top of sanitising each room after theyve been used  as well as disinfecting garments of clothing after theyve been tried on When its busy  they are closed  and all staff are on the shop floor in order to help customers as best as we can  keep the shop tidy  and put the returns and dumped clothing back in the right places  We allow people to try on jackets  shoes  button ups  etc and just ask they are left behind the till if theyre not wanted so we can disinfect them  Sometimes  people will try bits and bobs on without our permission and it isnt the end of the world  we just tidy around after them and complain about it to one another  Today we had the fitting rooms closed  however  something must have been in the air  Pam started putting the clothes on  Okay  fair enough  its over her own clothes  Ill leave her be  I carried on tidying  looked up to check on the robbers and Pam was now in her bra  slipping a dress over her head  A couple of times now we have had customers sneak into our fitting rooms  but our in the open like this Even pre Covid  when was it ever okay to just get half in the nud in the middle of a shop   I went immediately over to my manager and told her what happened  she brushed it off  saying something along the lines of  well if she wants to be half naked in the middle of the shop  let her   There wasnt exactly a lot more we could do about it after that realistically  One of the girls on the till  lets call her Vicky  came over to see the faces of the people who were known for robbing  just so that she could make sure to double check their items if she was to serve them  I told her about the woman getting undressed  and as soon as she started walking back to the till  ANOTHER woman took her top off in the middle of the shop so I shouted her back over to see  The robbers were now both trying clothes on too  and Pam started to put some other clothes on  I didnt know what to do  the state all of these women were leaving the shop in was horrendous and I just wanted them gone Another girl I work with  lets call her Stella  came over to tell me that the manager now wanted the women told not to play dress up in the middle of the shop  I think the manager realised how out of hand it was beginning to get  We were umming and ahing until Pam took her top off again and Id had enough  I went over and said pretty much exactly  Im sorry that our fitting rooms are closed  but you shouldnt be trying clothes on in the middle of the shop floor  not only because of the pandemic but its also extremely inappropriate to be in your underwear in the middle of the shop floor  I obviously didnt say it kindly  but I wasnt angry  I told her  and the two robbers who were also trying clothes on  sternly  I know I couldnt have even raised my voice because the robbers were asking me what I said as they couldnt even hear me  Pam  though  said I was shouting at her and intentionally embarrassing her in front of the whole shop and I was angry and horrible  she wouldnt stop  Stella was telling her that I wasnt shouting but she wouldnt listen  Stella was actually very calmly saying  I understand how you feel and I understand what youre saying  but I was right here and OP wasnt shouting at you   but Pam wouldnt listen  I said  can I talk   and Pam replied  WELL I HAVENT FINISHED TALKING YET  and proceeded to repeat everything she had just said  Stella pulled me away and we left them to it When theyd all finally left the mirror  I started cleaning the state that theyd left the shop in  it was awful  I hated touching the clothes that theyd worn  I wish Id have got the disinfectant from the fitting room but I wasnt thinking straight  I just wanted it tidy  Vicky came over again and told me that Pam was just screaming at Stella  telling her that she shouldnt have sided with me  She said that the two women behind her had to ask her what was the matter and said that we were being horrible to her  Stella simply informed Pam that those two women were thieves  so it shows how strong their judge of character must be This is the first serious altercation Ive had with a customer after having worked in this store for nearly a year  not excluding lockdowns to be fair   Im not a confrontational person and I tend to give my customers the benefit of the doubt  But to expose yourself in the middle of a shop  Thats seriously inappropriate  And to put clothes on without any safety measures in place  As silly as that sentence sounds  it just upsets me,5527,1040

basically sold phones and activated service for people Around this time  we had been unbelievably slow  Like  for the past four weeks at that store wed only see maybe  person a day  if at all  Incredibly boring  and I was getting paid to basically stand around on my phone all day because without customers there was nothing to really do at our location  Thered be a lot of times where Id completely zone out  and forget I was at work  and Id feel like a zombie when customers would come in  Like I was on auto pilot  if that makes any sense  Was hard to snap out of Well  one day  I was in this mode  I was working with a coworker who did not like me  and would go out of his way to avoid interacting with me  So I was inside  behind the counter by myself  playing on my phone  while said coworker was outside talking on the phone to his wife mom dad friends whoever  out of sight  However  at this time  I thought he was in the employee back area A lady walked in at this time  very energetic and bubbly  with her teenaged son    and a dog carrier with a puppy inside  She seemed nice  but something felt off about her and I had a bad feeling  She explained that she had an appointment with us  and I was unaware that wed had any so my response was   Oh  I didnt realize we had any today  Which it doesnt really matter if thered been any kind of appointment  she was there so she was going to be helped regardless  My statement seemed to throw her off  but I explained it wasnt a problem  I grabbed a nearby tablet to start opening up her account  and she started explaining to me that she was just going to leave the dog off to the side of her  as itd just been at the vet for a surgery  I wasnt sure we were allowed to let people bring animals  but the dog wasnt hurting anyone so I didnt care Its important to note  that our tablets work terribly  It is one of the main reasons I quit  because they decided to get rid of our computer systems and make our entire work process on the tablet  They are slow and glitchy  and the turn over rate in our district went from being balanced to insanely high because of this decision  They failed to troubleshoot the system all the way before releasing it as well so there were a lot of problems For some reason  my tablet wouldnt open  so Im standing there trying to figure out why it wouldnt bring the lock screen up  The lady looks at me and goes   Well  are you ready for our number yet  Its  Me    Sorry  one second please Maam  I put that tablet down  and grab the other tablet we had out that was ready  frustrated that the other one wasnt working suddenly  I start to open our system up  when she interrupts me Her   Wait  this is the store on  street name  right  Me   trying to make small talk  Yes maam  Theres another one across the street as well though  Why  Her   Do you think you could call them and see if they had any appointments for  Her name   Me   Sure  give me a second to look up their phone number  The store across the street from us  their number was harder to find because you had to use different keywords  It was a stupid layout  because people would confuse them all the time  If you just typed in   store name   city name   it would bring up our store number After a few minutes  I find their number  and start dialing it on our store phone  As soon as the phone starts ringing  the lady interrupts me again Her   Actually  since it seems like you dont want to work with anyone  I think I will go across the street  This is kind of when I broke character  because at this point I was already over the job itself and was very frustrated  Not even with her  but her attitude and tone at the time absolutely infuriated me  Im not saying I was in the right either  but the way it seemed to come out of nowhere also threw for a loop  Like  was I not just assisting you  Was I not about to call for you  or blatantly refusing service  Wtf  I tried to be polite  and not catch an attitude  but it was hard to hide the frustration in my voice Me   Whered that come from      Maam  I really dont care  its entirely your decision if youd like to go across the street  Her   in complete shock   Whatd you just say  Me   That I dont care  it is your decision whether you would like to leave or not  Im glad to help you either way  Her   Well  I think I will leave  Ill have you know Ill also be reporting you    finger wag Me   Go ahead  its my last week anyway  Her   is anyone else here  Id like to speak to someone  Me   Um  yeah  let me go get them from the back  So I go into the back to get my coworker  but he isnt anywhere to be found  I hear her trying to open the door thank god for locks   Next thing I know  the customer is banging on the door with her fist  Like  violently  Totally freaked me out  and I was lost on what to do because I wasnt sure where my coworker was  So I just sat down  and watched the cameras  Maybe I was an asshole  but going back to talk to her didnt seem like a good idea  This was all in front of her son as well  so that mustve been embarrassing My coworker finally walked back inside  because it was the end of his shift  and he was about to clock out  I have no idea what was said between the two of them  but he was able to calm her down a little bit  Though she still seemed pretty pissed  because I could see her wagging her finger in his face  talking to him  He was super agitated as she was leaving  so it must have not been fun for him to deal with  He let me know that she did  in fact  have an appointment and then left,5814,1085
289,o2anfd,1,58,oh look it is two today hey all got  smaller stories that happened today  the st one i heard offhand from my manager at work today and the nd is well you will see    the first thing was that a bartender that works for the bar behind my store came out and yelled at a truck delivery driver for  making my customers walk around the front of your truck   which is illegal  atleast so i am told  cause it was impeding the drivers delivery since she was telling him to move the truck or turn it around  All of this infront of my manager who was supervising the delivery      the nd was a pair of overset women came into the store   looked in her s while the others was around  or so  So the women come up to me asking about the chlorine tablets we have and I show them  the younger one pulls out her phone and asks me  so why can I not buy this online with my app   I explained to her several times  very nicely might I add  that we do not sell the tablets online cause of the shortage in stores  this lady basically complains about this for half an hour until my manager got off her break and came back into the store and decided to take over  and the lady spent another half hour complaining about the same thing and my manager told her the same thing i did  When the two ladies did leave the younger one said  i am never coming here again  that lady was an ass  which my manager is the nicest person you would meet in retail,1441,289
290,o1lxly,1,17,Confused patron I was reading through some posts and it reminded me of a situation that occurred back in It was getting late and we close at am  I no longer work at this chain  An older gentlemen was loading up a wagon for about an hour and a half  I was the sole register open   employees total in the store our manager and assistant manager and a Cart pusher doing stocking duty for the evening It was just before closing my manager noticed the man still did not seem ready but we closed the store anyway with him still shopping and the  of us focused on assisting him He was kind soft spoken yet very confused When he finally made it to the register we rang him up and he promptly paid  I cant remember if my Manager considered contacting the authorities but sometging did not seem right about the man After we finished our closing and locked the store we came outside to see him still standing there with his cart My manager spoke to him again he seemed disoriented but I couldnt gather what the exact conversation they were having was We ended up verifying his address on his drivers liscense and I drove him there he had walked to the store he did not have any transportation  There were no cars other than ours in the parking lot either I drove him home I remember distinctly he asked me to leave his groceries near his door but did not want help taking them in None of this was very inconvenient I lived  minutes away he lived the same distance from the store  But I never saw him again and always felt uncomfortable about the situation,1579,284
291,o1iuqq,1,5,I know what you want but    Hello fellow redditors  thought id share this little nugget from work    So I am a retail worker in a pool store and this woman walks in  I great her as per customs with the store and she asks  hey do you have any pumps that can suck out like propane or something    also gonna mention she was gesturing her arms in the motions of a pump   um  I know what you are asking for but  we dont have pumps like that in out store  you might want to go down to  insert store name  since they might have that type of pump  and I point in the direction of the store  She thanked me and walked out  I am still confused and walked back and told my manager about this  we had a nice laugh about it  My question is though  why ask for that type of pump in a pool chemical  supply store  All our items are pool related so we have nothing to siphon gas,870,173
292,o1ht5u,1,250,I’ll go into labour after I check out these sales In college I worked at a large chain store that happened to be going out of business so there were massive closing sales  During the evening while I was sorting some clothes in the Women’s Department  a very pregnant woman and her mother walked past me and all I hear is “oh my gosh  I think my water just broke ” Naturally  I whipped my head around to face the women since that’s not a line you hear everyday and sure enough  the woman’s pants were wet and a pool of clear yellow liquid had formed at her feet My first response was “oh wow” because my mouth reacted before my brain and just the amazement at the whole situation  I asked if they needed an ambulance to be transported to the hospital or if they wanted to take their own vehicle or call someone  And to my shock   the mother said that they were going to shop around in the store a bit longer because “these sales are too good to pass up” and the daughter whose water just broke and is leaking onto the floor  agreed    So they kept shopping and looking around  and tracking amniotic fluid everywhere they went and finally made their way to the cash to check out Meanwhile  my coworkers and I are scrambling to find the Wet Floor sign but it is MIA so I had to stand near the area where the woman’s water initially broke and direct customers to walk around it the fluid So they check out and leave to go to the hospital and at this point the woman was definitely going into labour and was waddling  more than a pregnant woman usually would  to get out of the store  As soon as they left  we broke out the cleaning supplies and started sanitizing I’d like to point out that when my coworker checked them out  she said that they weren’t even buying anything baby related  but all women’s clothing  I’m not judging because she could very well have had all her clothes and everything ready for her baby  But is a store closing sale really that important that you’ll keep shopping even after your water broke Never saw them again but hope the baby was born healthy,2084,384

302,nzd70y,1,53,Marriage on sale for    To this day Im still at a loss on how to process this specific interaction I had as a manager working for this particularly popular fabric store in my town  A woman had come in during one of my weekend shifts and I was asked by one of my coworkers to help her because she was being difficult  I happily complied believing that the woman in question simply did not know what she wanted   we get a lot of customers that dont know what they want for their projects  which is no big deal  I greet her and she tells me shes looking for cushions for pillows  She first tells me Im handsome  Im a guy  then I start showing her the cushions we had in stock Immediately she starts telling me that these will not do  that they are not right for the sofas she is trying to make before her sisters fly in  She further proclaims that I am incompetent and dont know what I am doing as well as threatening to report me to my reporting manager above me  This continued for what seemed an eternity and I gritted my teeth because Im too nice and patient  When she finally decided on something that she was okay with  the interaction shifted to me as a person  She asks if Im single  Uncomfortable with this complete  of a conversation I reluctantly reply  no   She then describes how she as a woman does intimacy acts the best and that as a man I need to experience it  Furthermore she asks if Ive been in an ARRANGED MARRIAGE Weirded out completely  I again reply  no    Marry me then   She replied  Quickly and awkwardly I said  no thank you   She did not like this answer at all  She went on a rant with threats about how the employees need to help the customer and that basically the customer is important  The verbal abuse continued to drain me along with the sheer disbelief  She ended her rant with yet again a threat to tell the general manager about how I was terrible and not only unwilling to help a customer but also terrible at my job entirely She gave me her cushions and told me to put them on hold for her until she came back  then left  I Quickly complied and walked away to make the hold  So I guess the moral of the story is  youre a terrible worker if you cant marry the customer  Lol,2240,419

305,nyoub7,1,24,Short Tempered Customers Steal Two Loaves of Bread and Berate My Customer Service While Doing So  I’ve worked at my grocery store for almost  years at this point and found nothing that felt crazy enough or important enough to share here  until tonight Today was a mostly average day at work  wake up tired and have a slow first couple hours on till  then get energized after a nice caffeinated beverage on my first break  The rest of my shift goes very smoothly with lots of compliments from my customers  Many of them were very happy to see me back on till as for the past few weeks I needed to do other jobs to let my hands recover  All in all a pretty typical and enjoyable day… Until the last hour or so of my shift After my last break we really started slowing down and with so many cashiers on till most of our time was spent finding little tasks to occupy our time  I ended up asking my manager if there was anything else I could help with  and she had me put our reduced to clear items in separate boxes to donate to the food bank  I ended up getting that done with half an hour left on my shift  So I was asked to clean my till and got that done when I was called to help a customer in the bakery Normally when cashiers are called to help in the bakery it is to write on cakes  get items out of the display case  or take orders for cakes  but today when I got there the customer had a different request  He asked for some of the bread that was left out unpackaged the temporary storage trays  I don’t work in the bakery normally so this might be wrong   Most of our employees would likely say that they don’t know their way around the bakery and thus can’t help  but not I  I told the man I don’t know why it was left there but I can see if I can get them for him if he really wants it  He said he did so I was off I quickly went searching for the bread packaging and found a box with the correct label and so I told him I’d quickly wash my hands and grab him one  By the time I got back with the loaf two other customers  a young looking boy and a slightly older looking woman  siblings maybe   were lined up behind him and asked me for two  I asked them for a moment and sealed the bread for the first customer and went to find the price  I checked all the displays that normally would have the bread on them and I couldn’t quite find the price  I was about to give my manager a quick call to ask her if she knew  when the boy asked me if I could get them their bread first  I was a little caught off guard by this given I needed to find the price to be able to sell the bread and I told them this  In response the woman said they can do it in the front  I know that they can’t so I say that the only way to do that is if they find the price here so I might as well find it first  She then tells me she worked there a few years ago and that she definitely could and she says some bs price at     I know that definitely isn’t the price so I quickly say it’s closer to     in hindsight I think it was    but it’s not too big of a deal   So I tell the man and wish him well and he is off  Now I tell the other customers that I don’t know why the bread has been left out they ask if it’s stale  This is a bread that has a hard outer layer and when I was holding the other customer’s bread it felt about normal so I told them that  They say that’s fine and that they want it so I get them their bread  I’m about to seal it in the bags when they tell me they don’t need me to do that  Once again I’m surprised but sure if they are happy with their bread unsealed then I will happily leave them to it and they are off A couple other customers are asking for a cake order  unfortunately as cashiers we have been asked to not take them unless we have been specifically trained by the bakery  So I tell them that and I will find someone else to take it for them so they can do their order  I quickly run to the front and ask the person taking over the service desk and self check if she has been trained she says she has and hands over the self check key to me  Low and behold the two customers from earlier arrive at the self checkout with their bread and a few other groceries  They need me to give them an override because there is too much weight on the scale  So I do my normal thing and ask them what the last item scanned was  it happened to be correct  I double checked their scanned item and all of them were on the scale  Then once again I’m caught off guard when the woman asks me if I’m new here  as if taking these steps are somehow a sign of inexperience   I reply by telling her I’ve been here for almost  years then do the override and tell them they are all good  I then await them calling me over again to help them with their bread as there is no way to enter it on the self check system without employee assistance  I quickly help some other customers with overrides and laugh with them about how finicky our self check is  Then I notice the initial two customers are paying and I am instantly confused and intrigued by how they managed to finish ringing through their items without my assistance As the customers walk away from their check out I ask them how they did their bread and they show me their receipt and point at an entry labels sandwich rolls  for     The woman then tells me that the bread was    per loaf  At this point I’m assuming they are very confused and I inform the that they entered sandwich rolls and not the bread they had  She tells me that the image looked exactly like the bread and so I go over to the self check and ask her to show me what she did  I notice they also left their cake in their basket which is kinda silly but I figure I’ll deal with it later  So I start opening the item menu to have her show me what she did  when the boy is pressing on the bread and all of a sudden decides it is stale  He says it’s rock hard and I apologize because I don’t work in the bakery I don’t know how exactly the bread is supposed to feel  She then says is this what you call customer service  Immediately I feel adrenaline coursing through me as I take great pride in my customer service and work as hard as I can to make sure all of my customers have the best experience possible  So I ask because I’m genuinely confused what did I do wrong  The woman then exclaims “unbelievable”  The boy asks her to leave it  I tell her I’m confused and I don’t understand what happened  She then tells says she doesn’t want to speak to me and she wants to return the bread and buy sourdough instead  I tell her I can help her with that  and she gets more frustrated and tells me she will go to the service desk because she doesn’t want to speak to me  I tell her that at this time I am at the service desk  And she says well I want to speak to anyone other than you  I tell her we don’t have anyone else available at the moment as my manager was on break and everyone else who could be at the service desk was busy  She tells me she’ll have one of the cashiers do it  While the cashiers are on till they aren’t supposed to do returns  it’s only supposed to be managers or the person working at the desk  I tell her this  And she even more angrily tells me that she doesn’t care who does it as long as it isn’t me  So I take a moment  pause  and ask where things went wrong and if there is anything I can do to improve her experience with me  She yet again tells me she doesn’t want to speak to me  I ask again and tell her I’m the only one who can help her and I’d like to do that if she can just tell me what went wrong and how I can serve her better  She absolutely doesn’t care and is practically hiding behind her arms at this point trying to ignore me  Then our service clerk for the day comes by and says he can do the return  I tell him that while he is normally a cashier while he is service clerk he isn’t supposed to do that  he has only been here for a couple months   But he insists  and I am forced to allow him to do it as if I continue to protest that would actually be bad customer service and I cannot allow myself to do that especially when I’m already being accused of poor customer service I let him process the refund and ask him what issue she had with me  and she says she thought I was accusing her of stealing  Which I very much wasn’t and I wouldn’t have thought at all normally until she said that that was her issue  He also told me that he recharged them and it ended about being about    for the bread  And no they didn’t actually change it for sourdough like they said they would  I then glance over at the clock and see that I am a minute past the end of my shift and quickly punch out  Then I double check the till and print the last receipt  and it is not the return receipt it is something entirely different  which means they left without actually paying and they had stolen the two loaves of bread I then fill my manager in on the details of what happened and she confirms they were definitely stealing as getting increasingly irate and refusing to explain themselves is a very telltale sign of attempted theft  The idea is they will scare you off so you might end up letting them go  She was also very shocked to hear that they insulted my customer service as I am one of the best at that in the store And yes  I know this whole story is basically about   worth of bread being stolen and it’s pretty pointless to actually get worked up over something so small  But on principle I can’t let people leave without paying as that would be theft even if unintentional  And then I very much couldn’t let the situation simply stay after they attack my customer service  Once that happens I go into my serious mode where I take the interaction ridiculously seriously as I need to show them that their initial impression was wrong and I am in fact able to provide top quality customer service which is why I couldn’t simply let them go Anyway sorry about this massive story and thank you for reading to the end  If you have any questions or would like me to clarify anything I’ll happily do so for you if you ask in the comments  Thanks again,10149,2006
306,ny8jwf,1,26,If I buy a bunch  can you give me a better deal  So a story on this sub Reddit reminded me of this  Where I use to work  probably similar to a lot of retail locations  we’d have one item on the front page of our sales flyer which would be discounted heavily  Like  percent off or so  And it would a type of item where they would put in “While supplies last ” There was one item we had on the front page  and I was curious to see how much money our store were making per item  and since I have access to look up that info  I decided to take a look  We were making  cents per item  I had a women come in  and she was buying a whole bunch  I can’t remember how much  but she took a huge chunk of our inventory  She then proceeded to ask me “Since I’m buying a whole bunch  can I get them cheaper ”I looked at her and replied “No  Sorry  We are only making  cents for every one sold ” She gives a defeated “Oh ” I can’t remember what she did next  but I think she put them back where she got them  I don’t remember the sale price  But I think it was below  dollars,1080,220
307,ny7sor,1,29,I’ll just buy a new one Worked in a camera store sooooooo many life times ago when digital cameras had only just started coming out To go along with the then new tech  we started doing in store printing from digital media but only certain media like CDs or USB or Floppy  I had this one customer come in with one of the latest Kodak Digital cameras wanting to print the images from it  He took the memory card out  a very flimsy smart card  and told me to print from it Now we couldn’t print from a smart card  so I told him I’d need to transfer it to a CD before printing  which would cost nothing  Either he didn’t understand what I what telling him or he didn’t hear me so I repeated it  He then went in to a full meltdown about how he spent so much on a camera that he can’t print from  that it was a hunk of crap etc etc  Even my manager was telling him that we CAN print but he needed to give us a moment to get the set up to do it  Nope  Customer wasn’t having it and continued his rant only to throw that camera in our bin and shout that he will go an buy a better one……  My manager and I along with a customer or two that were there  just looked at each other bewildered  We retrieved the camera from our bin  downloaded the images and found a picture of the mans driving licence  We then packaged up the camera and posted it out to him with a CD copy  with a PDP pay postage on receipt label  like hell were we paying out to send him is property which was also damaged after the bin toss   Back then the courier charged a flat rate for delivery with   surcharge if paying on receipt  Not too sure if they do that now  but we never saw that customer again,1673,328
308,ny0am0,1,17,“Your last check will be mailed to you ” Apologies for lengthy post  TL DR at the bottomApologies if this isn’t the proper place for this story  I’ve just really wanted to rant about it for a long time  I worked for a major retailer for about two and a half years  from August of  to December of   I realize that’s not nearly as long as some people stay at jobs but it’s long enough that I was pretty familiar with the management staff  including the store manager  I’d seen many people get hired and many people get fired or quit  I’d worked over my schedule  worked off days  and been generally reliable  Near the end of   my partner at the time was hospitalized for some health complications  I missed a day of work to stay at the hospital with them  I called and spoke to the manager on duty for that day who instructed me to use their automated call out line  I  did forget to do this but I returned the next day and apologized and asked if there was any way to overlook it due to the circumstances  They gave a vague answer which I took to mean they’d handle it for me  Perhaps this was arrogant of me to think  but I expected that my performance and reliability would have granted me some leniency  Regardless of whether I was right or wrong to believe that  I was fired  I tried to clock in the next day  only to find my badge and employee number wouldn’t work  I spoke to the store manager and one of the assistant store managers who explained that because I hadn’t used the automated line for calling out  my absence had been entered as a “no call  no show”  I didn’t beg for my job or bother wasting my time discussing options for returning  I was too angry and my partner was still in the hospital  I did however ask about my final paycheck  as I would need it to pay my rent  The store manager says “your last check will be mailed to you ” I leave  and begin looking for other jobs  Being unemployed for any amount of time would make paying my share of rent for my apartment difficult  I wasn’t able to immediately find anything that was full time with a rate that would keep me in my apartment  But all was not lost  I had some money saved up  And I did have at least one more check coming in the mail within the next week or two  I did find a part time job that I started while I kept looking for something full time  After three weeks I called the store I’d been fired from and spoke to a different manager who assured me all final checks are sent in the mail after termination  By this time  the complex had already given notice to my roommates about our rent being a little late  I assumed my check was just lost in the mail but still on its way  I kept looking for better work and kept working the PT job I had   Eventually the complex informs me that we have now incurred a late fee  in addition to the rent we already owe  As everything begins to close in on me  I get a message from a former coworker who still worked at the store  Something close to “hey  do you know you have a check here  HR’s been holding it” I respond simply  “no I didn’t know that  Thanks ” I immediately go to pick up this check  furious at being lied to and having my money simply held  I ended up speaking to the assistant store manager who had been in the room during the discussion where I was told how I would receive the check  I told him “that’s my money  and you’ve been holding it here after I was told it would be mailed  That belongs to me and you’re going to give it to me ” Maybe that sounded a bit extreme but I didn’t  and still don’t  care   He said something back that I don’t remember  I knew he didn’t like what I said but he didn’t have a choice  So he gave me the check and I left  fuming  It was not enough to pay the rent and late fee and we were eventually evicted  But if I had received it sooner  it would have covered my share of rent for the month  with some left over to help with the next  I know it was a simple mistake that led to me getting fired  I do accept that responsibility  My frustration comes from the fact that I was told twice my check would be in the mail  while it was sitting in a cabinet in a desk for weeks TL DR  worked at a store for   years  did overtime  worked off days  worked nights for months on a remodel  fired for missing a day when partner was hospitalized  did not receive my last check in the mail in time for rent  was evicted afterwards,4418,857

310,nxx8ic,1,95,“If you can’t give me a deal on this  I won’t shop here” So this has surprisingly occurred twice within one week but a customer would come in looking for a couple of ties  Our ties have no deal with them and are     each  A man comes in  grabs  ties and asks “is there a deal for three ties considering I am getting multiple ”“Unfortunately not” I saidApparently this guy didn’t like my answer and expected to bend to his will because he replies with “are you able to give me a discount since I am wanting to buy   If not I will not shop here for anything else”“Yeah I can’t do anything in regards to giving a discount on products unless there is a pre existing deal with it” I said  The next thing he said made me want to actually laugh though “Are you sure  Because I really need these ties”  I shake my head and repeat that “unfortunately there is nothing we can do” so he walks out talking about how “we are losing a valued customer and lots of money”Sure thing dude,988,186

313,nxhix5,1,0,When your own workers dont have common sense I called one of our store locations today after a customer stated she was denied a refund because they didnt have enough cash in the register  I advised this can happen in the mornings but it should have been put back onto her card if not  The customer said the worker straight up  a keyholder mind you  told her that since it was done as debit  she is only allowed to give cash back and since she doesnt have enough money  the customer will have to return later  So I called the worker like WTF  She said   I was trained to only put it back on a card if it was credit and only give cash back for debit   I was like so you refused to put it back on her card because its debit  She said yes  I straight up had to explain to someone who has been working for us since  that a debit card refund can be put back on the customers debit card and we shouldnt be denying returns when they have everything they are supposed to  I mean how ridiculous  Never heard of such an insane thing  Shes gonna love having her manager call and be like wtf no one trained you like that 🙄,1126,219

316,nwv0ep,1,31,Guy Upset Over Checks So ive talked about the hellscape that is the store I work at for my evenings weekend job  The thing about this place is weve strict  Or supposed to be strict  but the boss friends are immune to the rules cause friendship  rules regarding checks  Rules that vary depending on if its a paycheck or a checkbook check  Our store identifies paychecks as those obnoxiously large checks that come with a paystub that you get from your employer  where everythng is printed on the check and not written in via pen  Its payroll checks We only do cash back for  dollars  so if youre not buying anything you can only write a check for   If you buy something  its  over your total  so still   For paychecks we only do   and there is a charge you have to pay if youre check is larger than    A lot of people get upset over this  because the boss lets some people write checks for  and not buy anything because shes buddies with them  Others get upset because they are regulars and the rules shouldnt apply to them  Now this one guy  hes an adult  probably in the   range if Im to guess  he comes in every few weeks with checks  checkbook checks written out to him that he wants to cash  says theyre his paychecks and maybe they are  its not my job to investigate where the checks came from and why they were given to him  The thing is  by the store rules  they dont qualify as paychecks because they are torn from a checkbook and are written out in pen as opposed to being a payroll check  Usually these checks have ranged from  to   so they are well over the limit were allowed to cash for those kinds of checks  He always gets upset and argues that we let him do it last time  I always return that I am not responsible for them breaking the rules  that Ive told him prior that we dont cash checkbook checks that large out Monday was kind of a rough day between numerous disasters at my day job and at this one I was stuck with a newbie who didnt want to work and a closer who was  hours late  The guy comes in with two checks that would have totaled out as over   I explained that we cant cash them out  do the same song and dance with him complaining that we always let him cash it and me reiterating the rules we have regarding checks  He lashed out and yelled   Where am I supposed to cash these f           checks if you wont let me do it here    like he was loud enough that I had people in the back turning to look   I admit  with how stressful that day had been I snapped back  and told him that maybe its time he start taking them to an actual bank  He tooks his checks and stormed off  I honestly doubt hes bothered to go to a bank  probably went to some other gas station and complained until they cashed it for him  Ill probably see him again in a couple of weeks  and well do it all over again  this is such a common thing tho  people trying to cash their checks here and being upset that we wont  is there like a reason people refuse to cash their checks at banks,3050,583

324,nvojie,1,14,Customer yelling at employees For a bit of context  I work at a retail store  in the shoe area  I havent been working there that long  but at the store  customers have to wait in line in order so workers can scan the shoes on a device and get them out of the stockroom  Before  customers could walk up to any worker and ask them to scan their shoes  But the policy has changed recently to them waiting in line  Today  I was walking past the line to scan shoes when the lady at the front called me  She was trying to talk to one of my coworkers  but she only spoke Spanish  My coworker doesnt speak any Spanish  but I do  so I asked her how I could help  She told me the shoe size she wanted  and so I told my coworker  My coworker already had her size  but she was telling him something in Spanish  and because he didnt understand  thats why she called me  She asked me why the line system had changed  and being a brand new employee  I asked him  He started to tell me why  but as he was telling me so I could translate for her   all of the conversation between her and I was in Spanish  she said  You have to tell me    So I explained to her that Im new  so I didnt know about the change  but I then told her the reason my coworker gave  After I told her  my coworker went to the stockroom to find her shoes for her  Then she started to rant about how she was busy  and that she didnt have time to wait all day  She told me how stupid it was how she had to get back in line for each shoe she wanted scanned  I suggested to her that perhaps it would be better to find all the shoes she wanted  and then wait to scan all of the shoes  She didnt really respond to that  instead reiterating how stupid the stores system was  She started yelling  and everyone in the shoe section was looking at her  I tried to calm her down  apologizing for the wait  but nothings working  She continues ranting about how busy she is  and periodically she keeps snapping her fingers at me and telling me to bring me her shoes  My coworker already had told her that he would bring her shoes to her  but anything that I told her seemed to go through one ear and out the other  because even though I would tell her that my coworker was bringing the shoes  she kept telling me to get them for her  My manager  who was at one of the registers saw that the customer was getting riled up  and so she called me from across the room to send the woman over  I told the customer to come with me  but she wouldnt budge  I explained to her that my manager would be able to help her with whatever she needed  She just kept asking me  Why  Why are you making me get out of the line   So eventually my manager had to leave the register and walk over to us  I went on my lunch not too long after  and I spoke to the same coworker who got the customers shoes when I came back  My coworker has been working at the store for a couple of years now  and he told me that hes never seen the manager get that overwhelmed before  The way Im describing the story may not seem so intense  but this woman was getting wild,3098,608

332,nsyr1i,1,6,Old guy yells at me while I help his wife pick out a vibrator  So  if the title and my post history isn’t self explanatory I work in a sex store  The stories I could tell just from my year here could fill a book  particularly because I work in a rather “methy” small town in Canada I also work late shifts most nights so  it gets Interesting Anyways tonight I had  fine glossy eyed specimen enter my store and they set off a few retail red flags immediately  so I kept an eye out  but offered my assistance and didn’t bother them while they looked around  For some context  everything in my store is under a magnet lock so I have to come over and unlock whatever product they are wanting off the hook  They asked me to come grab a few items off the wall and put them behind the counter while they continued to browse As I head back to the counter I hear a tell tale cardboard rip and see that the lady had ripped a box of lingerie off the hook and was examining it   While swaying drunkenly mind you  I walked over and gently asked for it back from her so I could tape the product back up since the box was all mangled now and she didn’t want it  As I’m turning around to do this she rips off another one I turn around and calmly say “Hey could you just be careful not to rip the merchandise off  I can grab anything if you want to look at it ” She apologized immediately and slurred that she was just trying to see the back  I told her it was not an issue   probably just heavy drunk hands  So I took both items back behind the counter to fix As I did this  Drunk hubby walks up to the counter and raises his voice at me as his wife continues to look around Side note  I’m incredibly upbeat and cheery  that’s just naturally how I am and It works great to de escalate situations  So imagine me genuinely smiling and being helpful through all this Drunk  D Wife  W Me  MD  We’re not spending anymore fucking money here  We would but we don’t wanna buy anything else from you ”M  “Because I asked her very nicely to be careful with the products ”D  “ ITS NOT LIKE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE    I’m coming back tomorrow to speak to your boss ”Me  “okay for sure feel free   I’m just doing my job making sure stuff doesn’t get damaged  Anything else I can help you with ”  my boss will honestly probably tell the guy to fuck off D  “NO  We’re leaving  “W  looking intently at the wall of vibrators “Wait hold on I like this one”D  “Babe lets go  we’re fucking LEAVING  NOW”W  looking at  different vibrators “Wait”D   practically screaming at this point  NO  NOW M  “Can I help you choose from any of those ”D  “I SAID WERE FUCKING GOING NOW”W  “One more minute  Does this one recharge ”Me  “No  not that one  But I do have this one over here that’s   off and is rechargeable   ”W  “It comes in pink ”Me  “Yup right here ”W  “And waterproof  “M  “Absolutely  “W  “Yeah I’ll take that  “So he stands with his arms crossed and brows furrowed while I grab the products for them  then he has to fork over   for all the stuff they grabbed  I happily bagged it all and asked all the basic questions  followed up by my best wishes for a lovely evening  And smiled because he didn’t say another word and I make commission    I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing if he tries to contact my boss tomorrowOh and I took down his license plate and gave  a lil tip there’s a possible drunk guy in a big truck who just left the sex shop    EDIT  my boss messaged me to let me know if dude calls and tries to complain he’ll be asked kindly not to shop at our stores any more  My boss doesn’t put up with abuse of his staff and that’s why I love him,3699,688
333,nqtejh,1,0,I need inspiration to stop listening to my shyness be more forward to get more checkout sign ups  or Im in trouble  Hi  Where I work in retail  more or less every single time we serve a customer we have to try to get them to sign up to our clubcard membership thing  I dislike doing it a bit as its pestering the customer but these sign ups are unfortunately part of the job   we have to get above a loose amount each week or were pulled up on it by management  We cant lie about how many weve gotten so far either as its all on the system  which oddly keeps shaving one or two off my total each week for some reason   Im not the only one who sometimes gets low numbers  some have done worse than me  but anyway  When a customer says theyre not a member after Ive asked them  I usually go to the often ineffective method of saying  Did you want me to sign you up  you get   and then I get cut off where they say no  and then once that happens several times  it badly affects my average for the week One of my colleagues recently gave me an almost fool proof verbal method of getting many more sign ups so I can keep the management off my back  her method is fantastic  she gets a ridiculously high amount using it   but shes much more forward with customers than I am  Sometimes I feel like I cant do it the way she does  Ive only tried it twice and it worked both times  but I actually find it difficult because it just doesnt come naturally to me   I dont want to annoy the customer There are other reasons that really put me off saying what she says using her method  too  Sometimes its just shyness  but other times its because a customer looks irritable and they dont look like they want to be asked about signing up or just dont look likely to agree to it  However  there have also been many occasions where Ive had a chirpy customer that didnt sign up but I bet if Id have used my colleagues method  they would have I care about what people think  I guess  and I dont want to be that pushy guy at the checkout  but I have to be slightly pushy to some degree on the sign ups to keep my proverbial head above water I feel like I need some kind of inspiration different thought process to be forward  What would you think to yourself if you were in this position to make yourself more inclined to throw caution to the wind  Sooner or later I have to employ my colleagues method  I think  so Id welcome any suggestions  Thanks,2467,461
334,nq6rfn,1,0,Why do you have to be so mad  This literally happened a few hours ago so my nerves are still kinda bad  but I work at a clothing store  and our fitting rooms are still closed  Not necessarily due to COVID  but because of the lack of staffing at the moment  I’m also in Texas if that paints a better picture for you  There are huge cardboard screens in front of them saying they’re closed  but they can be moved easily Anyways  I’m folding shirts in my department and I see a man  probably in his early s  having his daughter who was maybe  try on clothes in the fitting room  I approached him and told him they’re closed in which he said ok  and went our separate ways I see his daughter come out and go back in so I approach him again  We’re told to not purposely escalate situations which I was not intending to do  I was actually approaching him to ask for him to at least bring out the clothes they don’t want if they’re going to ignore the sign Before I even get to say anything he comes up to me  literally within inches of my face  and says “How am I supposed to know what fits my daughter if they’re closed ” Which is not a completely abnormal question  though maybe a stupid one  which I had an answer to if he wasn’t in my face  I should’ve had just called security  but I went to a manager instead  He ended up being allowed to finish shopping  but was told it wasn’t appreciated how he spoke to employees  I was heated so I took a  minute breather  Sorry it’s not a very satisfying ending  but I had to get it off my chest TL DR   year old man gets in a  year olds face because he doesn’t know what size his daughter wears  There were no consequences,1685,321
335,nn9wnq,1,18,Impatient customer cussed me out because there was a line for checkout and I wasn’t helping him first  Oh boy this is a fun one for sure  I haven’t gotten a lot of crazy people in my time  as I’m new to this working thing  but this guy is someone I will remember forever The customer will just be labeled as C for this story So one afternoon I was working with my manager  We were cleaning up the store and I was helping her with whatever she needed  After our shifts had been going on for awhile she decided to take her lunch break  While she was gone the store became very crowded  and soon there was a line for checkout  Four or five people were waiting  and I was trying to get through the transactions as efficiently as possible Three guys were looking at the top shelf of product  and wanted to see for themselves what it looked like and how much it was  So they took it upon themselves to grab our step stool and go up there themselves  I see this out of the corner of my eye and panic  because I’ve never had that happen to me before and I didn’t want C to fall  We also have multiple signs saying “DO NOT GRAB FROM HIGH SHELVES  please ask for an associate to help ”I finish a transaction and get to them right before they go up again and it kinda goes like this   Me  Excuse me sir please do not use the step stool C  I’m just going up there really quickly Me  That stool is for employees only  If you would fall that would be a liability issue C  I’m not going to fall  Almost in a scoffing tone Me  If you could please give me a moment I will help you when I can Pushing the stool away from the trio  I go over to the few customers back in line  They were my current priority and since no one else was available on the floor I was hoping the guys would just wait the couple of minutes They didn’t seem to get the memo The one box that they managed to grab from the top shelf was tossed onto the floor    worth of product that was prone to breaking mind you  They all get ready to leave and as loudly as I can I remind them to “Have a good day ” They all mock my voice  as it is higher in pitch  and the leader of the group says “Thanks for the dumbass help ” They eventually tried to come back  but my manager was there and didn’t let them in  I guess that’s karma for you,2319,444
336,nk7z9g,1,0,When a customer called security on me for following COVID protocol  You guys are getting a three for one  as it all happened in the same day     ———————Me   MeC   Customer C   Customer C   Customer ———————It’s a very long story  sorry about that 😅———————As this is my first post I’d like to just give a broad overview of what kind of store I work in  Just a retail store in a mall  nothing too crazy  We mostly get parents with young kids or groups of teens coming in  Unfortunately the people in talking about today are all adults C walked in with her mask under her nose  you can see where this is going already  and seemed super nice at first  She did exactly as I asked in regards to fixing her mask  took a   and quickly left  Well that was odd  She ripped off her mask  and tried to make a scene in the front saying very loudly C  “Yeah because apparently keeping my mask above my nose is going to stop me from dropping DEAD ”  Big emphasis on the dead I just ignored her and was helping out other people  turning up my music just a little bit louder as I did so  I was just a bit amused as she was  by all means  a grown woman C was nothing too special  the same as C but was mature enough not to make a scene  Just kind of scoffed at me and left after my “Excuse me ma’am would you be able to put your mask up ” question that I use with everyone My shift was quickly coming to a close  and it was still really busy in the mall  Let me set the scene  There was a line at checkout  I was on the phone with my manager  talking about how to do a refund properly   and there were still a good amount of people in the store  For  minutes before closing it was super hectic  Second to last person in the checkout I see them  C and another guy  he didn’t come into the store luckily   Super tall  full beards  and best of all they had no masks in sight 🙃 They were quickly approaching my store and it filled me with the worst amount of dread  Hating confrontation does that to a person Under my breath I’m chanting  “Please don’t come in  please don’t come in  please don’t come in ” The lady at the counter turned around in confusion at what I was referring to  and I said simply  “They aren’t wearing masks and I don’t want to deal with that right now ”C walks into the store guns blazing  wanting to test his luck  It’s a pretty small store and he’s a pretty big guy  so he makes it about halfway in before I get to him  mid transaction might I add  And what followed is something I’ll never forget Me  “Excuse me sir do you have a mask you can wear ”C  “I don’t have to wear it because I’m exempt ”Me  “I’m sorry but it doesn’t work that way  you need to wear a mask ”C  “Oh security is right outside  you don’t want me to go get them do you ”Me knowing that security will in fact save me  “Oh you can go get them it’s okay ”As I ring up the last customers  manager still on the phone with my confused manager  I see the guy grab a  poor security guard and bring him to the front of the store  Though I couldn’t hear the conversation going on  I did see the guard point to our signs  The signs that say masks are required to enter the business  So the guard escorted the man away from the store  and he was glaring at me the whole time it happened ———————Please note that in this moment I am completely aware of the laws in my state  and what the mandate actually says  If people are medically exempt from wearing a mask there are alternatives and other protocol to work with that  If you’ve read this to the end dang  That means a lot  Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this  and I’m sending good vibes your way 💜✨,3704,707
337,niz9kc,1,12,Covidiot on my first MOD Close So about a month ago I got my alarm code to be the closing manager on duty  I work at a large big box type store in Canada  One hour after the mid manger leaves I have a man come in without a mask  I ask him politely to put on a mask  he refuses  He claims a medical exemption  I sympathize however inform him that it is government and store mandated  I offered him a free face shield  He claims a medical exemption to face shields    I then offer that he could order online from his car and we would bring the product out to him  Only takes about  minutes  He explodes a stream of profanities on me at this point demanding to speak to the boss that’s me   I tell him he needs to leave  He demands all my info and the corporate hotline and storms out  First night solo went AMAZING  Wear a mask folks,836,164
338,nirp0v,1,0,TW  Assa lt  Got into a physical altercation with a customer    Okay im posting this because i’m still kind of shaken up   And needing a lil advice from the people   So just a backstory  it’s this “customer” well not really a customer cus he never buys anything lol   The only time he comes in is with the sole purpose to steal   Now don’t get me wrong  I don’t care about stealing  and I’d rather not engage with a customer because you never know their intentions   But Management said he’s a big problem to the gas station  because he’s a klepto   He’s stolen people’s phones  purses  everything   It’s so bad the store had to press charges against him and honestly he’s not even allowed in the store because the store has a whole restraining order against him   well anyways   i was told if i see him  alert authorities   now me being an empath b tch lol  i wanted to spare this dude considering he has a lengthy record   but i also wanted to protect my job   so the first time he came in on my shift  i asked him to leave   he argued with me at first but then left   now other cashiers have told me they’ve never had an issue with this dude when asked to leave and he never came back   but now i’ve noticed he repeatedly comes in the store when i’ve asked him to leave and not come back once before   so now i’m starting to feel like he’s taking advantage of me   of the fact that i am a small girl  and i was the only one on duty at the time   i asked him about four times to leave the store  out of one of those times he threatened to alert the authorities on me just because i was doing my job by asking him to leave and telling my manager  i laughed   but the last time he came in the store  idk it just kind of activated my fight or flight mechanism in my brain   he came in yelling  irate asking “where the lightskin b tch at   i wanna talk to her” so i came to the front and started yelling back at him   i really didn’t know what to do except for to just push him out of the store   i tried pushing him telling him to leave the store  but this escalated into a whole vi lent altercation   he threw me to the ground and b at me all on the top of my head   i didn’t fight back i just shut down at that point   once he got off me i called the cops on him and now he’s sitting in jail on an assault charge   i quit my job voluntarily because the incident has really scarred me kinda   but some people are starting to make me even feel bad for instigating the fight when my main goal was to never hurt him  just get him to leave   idk how to feel tbh   in the moment i felt like i was acting in defense  but now i just feel sh tted on,2642,544
339,nhg1j5,1,33,Man seems to have it out for me for no apparent reason So the past few weeks I have been in charge of training the new cashiers at my grocery store  last week I was training a new guy and it was  minutes till we went home  So I turn out out light and continue to help him bag As many of you probably know people don’t always acknowledge that the light is off  whether they just don’t care  or they don’t notice the light is off  But we don’t normally turn people away unless it’s close to our clock out time  about   minutes before clock out  So it hits    and we’re supposed to clock out at   So I head to the front of the line and I reach for the belt to close off the line when I hear someone come up behind me  So I turn around and see this man who I’m familiar with  and I tell him “oh I’m sorry  we’re closing up for the day  it’s time for us to go home”  And the man goes “no it’s fine” Which I assume means “I understand  you have to go home”  However he doesn’t move  and I assume maybe he misunderstood me  So I say “it looks like register  has a short line  he can help you out there”  And again he says “no it’s fine”  So I finally understand he means “no I’m just going to wait here and you’re going to take me here”  Now I’ve never had anyone do this before  so I was so shocked that I just let him come through  bagged his stuff  and left without telling him to have a good day So I assumed this was going to be a one time thing  this guy usually isn’t the most polite but he’s not normally that big of a jerk either  But today he proved me wrong So today me and my trainee for this week we’re about to go on break  My friend at customer service walks over and turns our light out and lets us know we’re good for our break  But when she walks past the bagging station she leans over and whispers to me “don’t look at register ”  Of course this gets my attention and so I do  And this same man is standing there  staring at me  Now register  has been empty all day  I’ve been bagging for my trainee and helping her with the register  it’s not my job to be checking at that moment  So I just ignored him  because he chose to walk up to a closed register and assume he would get service Then when he finally realized I wasn’t going to walk over and help him he walked into my trainees line  although  again  the light was off  but I truly wasn’t in the mood to argue with him  and I just let him come through  Because I desperately wanted my break  But I really couldn’t tell you what his problem with me is,2543,507
340,n6uqs4,1,14,“a  minute wait  that’s atrocious ” I’ve only recently started working at retail and I have so many stories of awful customers already  On my second ever shift  I was a runner handing out food to parked cars  It was  in the morning  I was tired and doing my job well  As I was handing the food to a car a man a few cars down starts honking his horn yelling at me to get my attention  I finish serving the customer and get to him  He begins complaining to me that he’s been sat in the parking lot waiting for  minutes and still hasn’t gotten his food  As I am a new recruit and not taught how to deal with this situation I tried to calm him down and saying “I’m sorry to hear that  do you maybe have a receipt or anything so I can hand it to the manager and get your food out to you ” however he cut me off instantly after the ‘sorry’ and said “I don’t want to hear your f  king excuses  get me my refund now” shocked at his response I quickly head inside the store and talk to the manager  She seemed very confused but said she would deal with it all and I calmed down and went back to doing my job  As I’m handing out the food again he honks and yells at me again  threatening to assault me and wreck the store if he sees me outside again without his refund  I try to ignore it and go on with doing my job  Finally after a few moments a manager gives him his refund and the food   so I get a sense of relief thinking he will finally leave and I can stop worrying about him  However  as I’m serving a customer he drives by and proceeds to throw all of his food at me  but misses  and threatens me again  I head inside and try to tell the manager everything but of course I get chocked up and go to the restroom to calm myself down    Why do people like this exist  How unlucky am I to have this happen to me on my first time ever being a runner  I swear I considered quitting that day and was so close to    Has anyone else dealt with someone so difficult so early into their employment,2001,400
341,mxv308,1,1,A little happy post about a kind customer ❤️ I was at work at a full serve gas station when I started to feel really sick  Nothing covid related just extreme nausea and dizziness  I’ve had vertigo in the past so I assumed it was just a flair up of that  It hadn’t been super busy that day so I sat down and called my boss  My coworker was on his way to cover the rest of my shift when a customer came in and saw me sitting  I put up my best front but was feeling really ill  He caught on and noticed that another car had pulled up for gas and offered to pump it for me  He did so and even rang them through  I thanked him profusely for his help and he told me it was no problem  By this point my coworker had come and I got to go home and rest up  but I’m still super grateful for this kind stranger,800,167
342,mwzp94,1,6,My first customer service award  Sorry in advance  this story doesnt have all that much spectacle  Just feeling proud and wanting to share If youve seen  my previous post here  https   www reddit com r TalesFromRetail comments mlkp old lady forgets her bank card nice lady saves  utm source share amp utm medium webx amp context    you may remember that I just recently started working as a cashier at a major grocery chain in the Pacific Northwest  Yesterday  I had an  hour shift  I had just gotten back from lunch  arriving back a little late because of a bloody nose  Allergies suck  but luckily my manager was understanding and gave me a little while to collect myself and rehydrate before going back on the registers Not long after logging back on  I get a customer who had three separate orders for a grocery delivery service  I do my usual thing and start making pleasant conversation  and he seems receptive  While Im scanning the stuff from the first order  my supervisor  not the manager  comes over to have me sign a thing regarding the  extra minutes or so that I took to clean up after my lunch break  The customer notices her and asks if theres a feedback survey he can fill out  There is  but apparently its down for upgrades  He informs her that hed like to give me an   out of   review  given my general friendly demeanor  We both thank him for saying so  and she tells him shell let the manager on duty know  The rest of the interaction is pretty standard  save for three separate transactions with the same customer Fast forward a few minutes  Its gotten fairly slow  and I only have a couple people in line  The same supervisor comes up to me and just sorta stands there  I ask her if somethings up  and she says shell tell me once Im done with the line  Immediately  I assume I did something wrong  This is still a new job  and I dont want to mess it up this early  I finish the line and turn to face her  fearing the worst Thats when she hands me a little business card style coupon for   off my next grocery purchase  I ask her why  and she explains that its because of the glowing review from the delivery customer earlier  Im a bit surprised  Ive only gotten one award like this before  and it was for when I volunteered at a local e cycle shop   A story for another time  perhaps   I thank her profusely  and promise to keep it up as best I can  She leaves  the next customer comes up  and I go back to my work  I ended up using that coupon after my shift to pick up some stuff Ive been needing Between this and my last post here  its nice to know that theres a not insignificant number of good customers in my town  This job might just be worth it after all  Thanks for reading,2746,473

348,ly383t,1,45,Woman got upset with me because I did what she asked I work at a grocery store and today this lady came through my line  She placed her items into  separate piles  and handed me an item and told me “this is a go back” and then said “oh and those too”  referring to the pile in the back  and so I assumed that the items behind the first pile were go backs  but just to be sure I asked “so these are also go backs ” And she said yes So I scan the first items  and put the others aside  She looked at the screen all weird  and at her stuff and so I thought maybe I had made a mistake  and was just about to ask when she inserted her card  so I assumed she’d figured out whatever was confusing her and that everything was ok  Then I handed her her receipt  and she looks at me and says what about that stuff over there  At this point I’m really confused and I explain that i was under the impression that they were go backs  She then got super angry saying that only the first item was a go back  and that she wanted to buy everything else  She continued to go on about it while I rung up her other items,1104,224

351,ltyn0g,1,34,a bigger quantity always saves you money  Alright heres a short encounter I had today with a customer  I am a cake decorator and in our cake case we have cupcakes      ct packages  Pretty standard  Well this morning a customer asked me to take two  ct cupcakes from the floor and put them  into a  ct container and charge her for the ct instead because she said it would be cheaper    I wouldnt do that anyway because taking the cupcakes out would mess up the frosting on the sides    A  ct package costs    whereas if she got the two  cts It would be    all together so actually its cheaper to get the two  and I told her this and she got really upset and basically told me I was wrong and that getting a bigger quantity always saves you money  I showed her on my calculator the two ct prices together and she still didnt believe me and she didnt get any cupcakes at all and said she was going to a different store,951,186
352,ltdv6z,1,39,Rude customer forced to apologize to me So this is a story from my first job ever  For some backstory  I worked at a department storefor three years and was working in the lawn and garden tolls section of the store  Took me some time to get use to it and learning about the specs for the merchandise was a bit of a pain but I managed with the help from my coworkers and they are awesome  miss them like crazy since I left but I do contact them from time to time  Story time  Ive been working there for a year and a half by the time and a pretty big snow storm was about to hit the next few days so we had a lot of people in the store wanting snow throwers  shovels etc  Outside the store chained up were some returned used snow throwers at a lower price but they make us some decent commission  more if a protection plan was added  This guy comes in and since I wasnt with anyone at the moment  our cashier directed him to me for help  He comes up to me asking if I could help with a snow thrower outside and I said sure  Jerk  as to what Ill refer to him by now going forward  started out decent in the beginning and was somewhat impressed that I knew better ways to take care of the snow thrower  thank you V  not using his full name  those extra details helped a lot  Jerk said he needed to check something else in the store but told me hed come back to me when he was finished for the sale  I said sure thing and placed a sold sign on it  About  minutes later he comes back and asks for me to finish the sale  I rung him up with no PP  protection plan  since  I gotten this a lot   his friend is a mechanic   Didnt hurt my numbers much since I had sold a much more expensive model with a yr plan The sale is done and I go with him to unlock it for since it was chained and had a security tag on it  no clue how that helped but I didnt care much  him and he asks if I can get a wrench to loosen the bolts  We go inside and this is where he went from kind to a jerk Jerk   So what about its horsepower  How much does it have  Me   Snow throwers dont go by HP they go by CC  Jerk   But do you know the conversion  Me   No not really  Jerk   So you dont know much else about the machine then  Just the basics and a bit more how to maintain it  Me  now knowing where this is going but trying to stay polite   Sorry but when it comes to more details like what youre asking me  I dont really know much else  This dude didnt go livid or anything like that  but was annoyed  He started insulting my knowledge  calling me an idiot and then said the company hired me because they were sorry for me  I normally am a very patient person  not wanting to argue unless I have to and I never been in an actual fight but I can hold my own if need be  Almost was in one though but that was before I worked there and that would be another story if I ever remember the details Also I was hired there cause my older brother worked for them also as a store manager  so there was reputation with our name at the store  Him being a store manager and me being one of the top sellers for my department  The manager who hired me didnt know we were brothers until he saw our last name and this was after he said I was hired Anyway  I was done with this guy and I told him also  I went back inside with him demanding the wrench to loosen the bolts but I told him no and tossed it back in to our tool box  He was annoyed and demanded a manager which the cashier called to get him to shut up and out of the store  Another coworker went with the wrench and loosened it for him  About  minutes later my managers came to the front of the store and asked Jerk what was wrong and he told them  However  my coworkers heard the insults and told the managers what he said  They called me over the PA system as I was away from the check out and away from him  I went over and this is what I came back to M   You need to apologize to my associate right now  How dare you insult him while hes been nothing but kind and patient to you  We dont take kindly to customers being rude to them Jerk   somewhat half assed   Sorry Me   Apology accepted  M   Good  now you may leave  We are done dealing with you  The guy left shaking his head and I thought he was muttering to himself but I didnt care anymore  My managers came up to me and said to not worry about him and that it was a smart idea to get away from him incase the situation escalated  They know that I have a lot of patience but even I have my limits  We spoke for a few minutes so I can just get that jerk out of my mind and my floor manager  who is a nice Jamaican older woman and the one who mainly spoke to Jerk  said  I hope that thing breaks while hes using it  He didnt buy a plan right   I shake my head and she said  Good cause I dont want him here or the repair center at all  I had a smile on my face for the rest of the shift  That remains my favorite moment of my life to this day  I currently work in a supermarket since I didnt return to the sporting goods store cause of the pandemic and my manager there is pretty chill also and I told him the story and said that hed do the same if that ever happened  I had a smug smile the whole time typing this out Edit  it was a  stage snowblower  For some reason I’ve just been calling them snow throwers despiste the subtle differences even a little before I left the company due to work becoming scarce  And with the horsepower part  the snowblower was about cc and even then I didn’t remember the conversion but it’s around hp,5575,1090
353,lsno3t,1,147,Why dont customers  or their spouses  actually listen to what we say  To give a little background  I work in a small store that specializes in pet supplies  There are  locations that all sell the same items  more or less   One of the things we sell is birdseed  It comes in jugs or bags  The bag is more than double the volume of the jug  but less than   more in price  We received  jugs and  bags of birdseed today and my colleague called a customer who had requested we put a couple aside for her  He said he had to leave a voicemail  as the customer didnt answer her phone  About an hour after my colleague left for the day  I received a call from the customers husband  The following is the conversation I had with him Me  We received our shipment today  and wanted to confirm that you wanted  jugs  Is that still the case  Youd save money by purchasing the bag  instead  Husband  Can we get  jugs  I didnt save my jug the last time   I recycled it  Can it be delivered tomorrow along with our food  Me  I can certainly do that  but are you sure thats what you want  If you buy  bags  youre saving money and have roughly the same amount of birdseed  I can send you whatever youd like  The food is ready to go   Husband  I dont have the jug anymore  Whats the price difference Me  Explain all the math   price savings as well as product volume  Also state that I can send  bags tomorrow as thats what I have to sell him  Husband  Oh  Ill take  bags  then  Me  Sir  Im sorry  I have  bags physically here in the store that I can sell you if you want them all tomorrow   Husband  OK  Ill take  bags then  That and the dog food  Me  mentally hitting my head on the counter   Sure  Ill send you  bags  Your total for the three bags and food comes to  whatever amount   If youre all set  Ill charge the card on file and my driver will see you tomorrow some time  Husband  Oh  yes  The credit card  Do you have my wifes card Me  Yes  Its on file  Ill charge it later today and she will receive an email receipt  Husband  Wonderful  Well see you tomorrow Me  Have a great day I called the location closest to the customers address  Luckily they had a couple of bags come in  so they were able to supply the missing bag  Why is it so hard for people to actually listen to what you tell them,2360,444
354,ls9b03,1,134,Minutes of my time wasted   Customer has me help them only to complain and leave cart at store So I work at a craft store chain with several stores in the area  Im a cashier  but since we have so many cashiers I often work on the floor when we arent as busy  Thanks to C   weve been having slow incomes of stock pilled on top of customers buying more supplies than usual since they are stuck at home having to do crafts  To set todays scene  I was returning items to the shelves when I got stopped by an interesting customer  C   CustomerMe   MeCK   Customers Kid CK   Customers Kid OSW   Other Store WorkerOSM   Other Store Manager C   Hello  do you have this style of yarn in stock  Me   Let me check  C shows me her phone and I find the item thats on our app  Theres a skew there which I look up  and it shows that we are out  Me   Im sorry  it looks like we are out of that yarn  C   Do you have any in overstock  Me   No  we do not  our list of stock details all stock  including overstock  C    sigh  When will you be getting more  Now  I need to emphasize that processing is not my field of study in this job  as I am normally a cashier  But I do know that we get new shipments in on Mondays  but yarn has been coming in increasingly sparingly and we havent gotten many new shipments in a while due to low supply  Me   Due to delays and low stock thanks to the pandemic  we are not able to tell when any new shipments of that yarn will arrive  C  beginning to look frusterated   Are you SURE there isnt any in overstock   Me   Im positive  We do not even have an overstock location set for this type of yarn  as we havent had overstock for it yet  As we are having this beginning to be repetitive conversation  CK and CK arrive out of nowhere  CK asks her mother a question CK   Moooommm  I need to go to the bathroom  C   Have CK take you  CK   But I dont know where the bathroom is   Keep in mind  these two children are young  The oldest  CK  looks to be maybe  years old  while CK is about  years old or so  Me   The bathroom is right around this corner   I point the direction C  shooing her kids off   Yeah  yeah  go   switches back to me  Are there any other stores that may have the yarn  Me      I can check  Can you please give me a moment   checks scan gun for other store availability  It looks like nearly every single store in the nearby vicinity is out as well  Though there is Random Town  RT  thats across the city which may have a few C   But thats so far    I dont want to drive out that far  At this point Im trying to stay as silent as I can  Im not very confrontational at all and tried to let the situation calm down as it could  C was beginning to look really infuriated from such a small thing  and I wasnt one to fuel the flames Me   I understand your frustrations  but Ive checked every single store that could possibly be nearby and every single one is out of stock except for RT  C   Fiiiiine  but Im going to call them to make sure they have it  Ill spare the most of the  minutes she had me help her set up a call with the other store  She insisted I stay and help her call  even when I had maNY other things I could do instead  During this time  her children had returned and were clearly desperate for their mothers attention  but C was physically shooing them off because this call was apparently more important  Eventually  C got on the phone with the other store after calling  times  C   Hello  can you check if you have this specific yarn in stock  I have the skew number here  OSW  Other Store Worker    Sorry  we arent able to do that since we are busy right now and dont have anyone avalible on the floor to check that  C   But I need to see if you have this yarn before I drive all the way out there  OSW   There isnt anyone avalible to check for you right now  C  now visibly frusterated   Can I speak to the manager  OSW      Im gonna put you on hold C  once put on hold  addresses me    Craft Store  has terrible customer service  At this point  I am baffled  C has now just addressed me  a customer service member of said craft store  complaining about the customer service of said craft store  In that moment  I had no clue how to respond and simply awkwardly nodded  What kind of response was I supposed to give   I want nothing more than to get out of this  And  to be fair  I should of  But I was too awkward to ask to leave  So  for  agonizing minutes on hold  I sat with C and her energetic children begging for attention  Eventually though  the Other Stores Manager  OSM  picked up the call  OSM   Hello  C   Hi there  Can you check if you have this item in stock OSM    checks  Im sorry  we do not have any of that yarn in stock  C   But Im at a different store and it says you do have it in stock  OSM   Sometimes the system incorrectly puts in the number in stock when mixing up returns  Our apologizes  C   Are you suRE  OSM   Yes  Im sure  C hangs up and turns back to me  Ill spare the next  minutes  but I managed to negotiate and look at other yarn she may also need for her project and see if she can get that yarn first  It took many more gruelling minutes of shifting through every single isle of yarn we had  but I eventually helped her get a cart full of yarn for her project  As soon as we finished  I was called up to the register to assist with the line  It was extremly hard to hide the visible relief on my face  Though  this isnt the end of Cs story  Luckily enough  even though we had  cashiers at the registers  I was  un lucky enough to get C back at my register when she went up to pay  Her kids were still running around but C didnt even look in their direction  I was desperate never to see Cs face again so I quickly rang her up  The trouble began near the end of the transaction  C    shows me a coupon Me   Im sorry  we no longer accept competitors coupons  C   Since when  Me   Since last March  There are several signs placed around the registers   I point her towards one C   Do you have any other coupons  Me   We have a   off coupon on our website  C   Do you have anything better than that  Me    explains all possible options we have for discounts at our store C   Can I just    can I   AuGH   grabs her purse and kids  Can you put it on hold  Me   Uh   sure   wait Before I could stop her  C nearly ran out of the store with her kids in tow  I tried to stop her to let her know that I needed a name and phone number to put it on hold  but she was gone before I knew it  I was now sitting at my register with an entire cart full of yarn that I spent  minutes helping this lady find  only for her to run out the store and demand I put it on hold  TLDR  Customer has me sit with them for  minutes to make sure they find their yarn  complains about the customer service of our store to my face  only to leave their cart at the register for me to put on hold once they find out they cant use another stores coupon,7098,1378

356,lrz8ib,1,9,Todays my birthday  It reminded be of another birthday story wherein I got the cops called on me because of a misunderstanding  So I used to work at a video game store a while back  We would take games and systems in for trade One day  a woman and her son came in and wanted to trade in the sons Nintendo DS to get something else  Sure thing  I can do that for you   I say as I take the DS  I power it on to test it out  as we do with all system trades  and it plays a startup jingle like most electronics  After I hear the jingle  I smile  and say   Happy Birthday   to the boy   Some of you already know why I said this  if you dont  it will become clear later The boys eyes widened in wondrous amazement  and he turned to his mom and said   Howd he know it was my birthday    with a big smile on his face His mother  however  did not have a smile on her face  It was a scowl  How did you know its his birthday   she asked inquisitively I started to respond   Well  the DS has   but was cutoff by her  Are you the one whos been stalking us   she said  Excuse me   I responded  I was quite taken aback  Youre the one whos been stalking us  Im calling the cops   she yelled  She ripped the DS from my hands and grabbed her sons hand and left the store  She turned to the left and went almost out of view and pulled out her phone  I couldnt hear what she was saying on the phone I should also point out that I was working by myself at the time  and there had been one other customer in the store near the back  She naturally heard everything  the store was rather small  and came up to inquire as to what happened I say   I dont know  she just freaked out when I said Happy Birthday to her son and said she was calling the cops  She responded   Oh  so she doesnt know about the DS jingle   Evidently not  I mean  I feel for her if shes got some issue or something  but yeah  she just kinda flipped out there  I checked her out  just buying some PS games  and I happened to see her trying to talk to the woman when she left  It looked like she was trying to convince her that it was a misunderstanding  but the woman wasnt having it  She stood there indignantly with her son  waiting I could have gone out to try to explain it to her but I thought that it might make things worse  so I decided against it A little while later  another customer came in  and as they opened the door  I heard the mother say   Hes a stalker in there  The guy was obviously confused  and he happened to be a regular  Whats that about   Reg asked me  Just a wild misunderstanding on her part   I say  I explain what happened and we both chuckled Assuming a cop would come to investigate  I prepared for their arrival by getting out a used DS to demonstrate the misunderstanding A few minutes later  I see a squad car turn up  The officer came up to the woman and led her away from the store as he took her statement  Reg and I were just waiting for him to come in Eventually  he did so  Lady said youre stalking her   he asked  with a slight inclination that he didnt believe her  Im guessing she was rambling or something when telling her story  Sorry  Officer     I look to his name badge  Brown  My names Knever  and its really just a silly misunderstanding on her part  She told you I said Happy Birthday to her son  right  He nods  Well  the only reason I figured it was his birthday was because they wanted to sell their Nintendo DS  and theres this feature    I pull out the DS and motion to it  See  when you turn it on  it plays this little jingle     I turn it on and it plays the jingle  Now  the thing is  if you turn it on on the birthday that was set by the user     I go into the settings and change the birthday to the current day  and turn it off      the jingle that plays on startup is noticeably different   and turn it on and it plays the special birthday jingle   Thats the only reason I knew it was his birthday  Officer Brown seems to understand  He takes my information and thanks me and leaves  I see him go out to the parking and talk with the mother  She seems displeased at first but appears at ease after Brown demonstrates on the kids DS what had happened  Even though shes calmed down  he appears to urge her not to come back in the store and leave Reg and I had quite a laugh after Brown left Believe it or not  Ive had a similar experience before this  wherein the mom actually let me explain  and she  the kid  and I were all happily amused,4551,834

361,lqwy5c,1,98,The customer was about to take off I  M  worked at a local grocery store from   before graduating from university and was a well known employee by most all of our customers  I had maybe  negative encounters throughout my  year stint there  but because we were extremely customer oriented I would bend over backwards even for the worst of our patrons  Keeping my mouth shut for so long in a customer service job had finally caught up to me when I knew I was about to triple my income overnight  I had accepted a job and was going to be moving out of state in a week when this happened  I was off of work for the day  but my mother needed some groceries picked up and I decided to go get them for her  The parking lot of our store was on a slope and we often had issues of runaway carts hitting cars  It usually wasn’t a big deal and people would leave a note indicating what happened with their number  As I’m packing up the car with my bags I look over and see a kid riding the cart down the parking lot and I let out a chuckle  come on  everyone does it   My laugh immediately stopped when I noticed he was going full speed towards a pretty beaten down car that happened to belong to one of my coworkers  He hit it full force and left a sizable dent in the drivers side door  His mother appeared out of nowhere  looked around  and quickly took the cart to the area where we store them  I’m sitting in my car watching this happen thinking  “Please God leave a note  Please don’t make me say something ” Sure enough she gets back to her car and opens the drivers side door  Me  You are going to leave a note aren’t you  Lady  What Me  Your kid hit that car and left a mark  You need to do something about it  Lady  Mind your own business it’s not even noticeable and I don’t have paper or a pen to write my information down on Me  If you’re not going to say something then I am  At this point I lost it  Mainly because I only had a week left working there and because I realized I was at the store  but not wearing my work attire and had dreamed of a moment like this for years  Me  You’re good with teaching your kid it’s okay to damage someone’s property and not take responsibility for it   What kind of person does that   What kind of role model are you being  You need to go in the store and tell someone Lady  Leave me alone  I’m leaving  At this point I get out of my car and start walking towards hers  She gets in  rolls the window down  flips me the bird  yells “Fuck you ” and speeds off  I got a picture of her license plate and told our store manager and the employee what had happened  His insurance took care of it  but I wish she had to pay some kind of price  tl dr   I wasn’t wearing my work uniform on a day off and saw a kid hit a car with a grocery cart whose mother let him get away with it and sped off after I yelled at her,2885,561
362,lq9d5c,1,83,Maam  that isnt English So this happened a few weeks ago and I nearly blocked it out of my mind I work in a home improvement store  Its a typical day where its not exactly power hour but its not like Im walking around without anything to do A lady walks ups to me and gets my attention  One very important thing to note is that this lady is Asian  She had broken English but Im going to be putting the proper grammar here Me   Hi  how can I help  Lady   Yes  Im looking for this  She holds out her phone to me  Now this happens quite often as people either want to show a picture  or perhaps they dont speak good English  I live in an area that has a lot of Spanish speakers but also a hefty Asian community  mostly Chinese Mandarin  Shes brought up a text message  and I cannot read it  I barely remember what it was exactly  which is why I didnt know if I wanted to post this story  but I remember   that it started with  La  and then followed by a word that I believe was something like  Cabilla   Note this wasnt the actual word used  but its what my coworkers thought maybe she was trying to look for  more on that later  My Spanish is mediocre at best  I took Spanish in High School but forming sentences is something Im not confident in  Only thing Im good at is numbers and recognizing certain characters   I try to learn from my coworkers bit by bit and we have fun with me trying to learn Me   Oh  sorry Maam  I dont speak Spanish  I can find you an employee who does  The Lady then looks at me like I just took my shirt off and started screaming while she watches me from the other side of a street Lady   Do you speak English  My brain short circuited in that moment  I couldnt comprehend what I just heard  Im so thankful I had a mask on because I couldnt hold back my mouth from expressing the  what the fudge   state  You all know the one When my brain started back up  which to me felt like a good minute  I say back   Uh    I do Maam  Im speaking it right now  I just spoke to you in English before   I rarely ever make a snappy comment like that  both because of anxiety and my attempts at professionalism  This was a line I never thought could have been crossed though  Lady   So do you have this  Read it  Its English   She holds out her phone again Me   Maam  Im sorry  but I do not know what that is  Because that is not English  or at least any word that I have heard of  I can try to find another employee who might know what that is  She then shakes her head   Why does no one speak English here    She walks away in a huff Im left there flabbergasted  Eventually Im able to maneuver myself to some coworkers who spoke Spanish  and I tell them about what happened  Theyre also shocked  but when I asked them what those words meant  when I actually had fresh in my mind what the words were  none of them could identify what she wanted  They reaffirm to me though that use of  La  was most likely Spanish  I eventually find a coworker who theorizes that perhaps she was looking for rebar   which they tell me  Cabilla  is an iron or steel bar   but the Lady  or someone else who sent that to her  had wrote it down wrong  Ive dealt with some customers before  but this was just mind boggling to me  I can only assume perhaps they mistook the use of the Latin Alphabet to automatically assume it was English  I dont hold any kind of negative thoughts to this person  Im very uneducated in regards to identifying languages myself  I understand the struggle of learning a new language in a new country since I did that myself when I lived in South Korea for a few years  Still  Im still just scratching my head regardless  Im gonna give myself a bald spot at this rate,3763,694

369,lbzlp0,1,117,Lady attempted to spit on me TL DR at the bottomNOT a woman refusing to wear a mask story A few months ago  around end of November  beginning of December  a woman came into the girls clothing store I worked at  Now the store I worked at recently closed due to being bought out  A lot of people were mad about that  yelling at the employees and demanding explanation  I wasn’t a manager or anything  so I didn’t really know much  just what I was told  So all I knew was that any purchases made after November th were final sale  no returns or exchanges  The registers are also set up where we have signs saying all sales are final and we have plexiglass between the cashier and customer  This lady came into the store and she looked pretty put together and wealthy  She was wearing form fitting jeans  a sweater  and had nice makeup on  In my area we require masks or face shields  so she had a face shield on it comes into play later   She also had  girls with her  probably  and   Both of the girls were also nicely dressed She walked around for a bit before finally choosing a set of PJs  She walked up to my register and paid for her things  with me telling her  times verbally that all sales were final  We tell them all sales are final before they pay and again when we mark their receipt final sale  She acknowledged me  paid  and went to walk out of the store  On her way out she stopped and looked at the PJs again  She seemed to find another set she liked  so she walked back up to the register  I took her at my register  assuming she wanted to buy the other set  but she slammed the bag of purchased PJs and the other set on the counter and said “I want to exchange these ” I looked at her and said  “I’m sorry ma’am  but all sales are final so I’m unable to do that ” She didn’t like that answer and started saying “I didn’t even leave the store  I was just bought these  do it ” I explained to her again that I’m unable to do that  we didn’t even have the option on the register anymore  She got more and more visibly aggravated with me  She kept demanding that I exchange the items  using so many different excuses like “I just bought them  they are the same price  I didn’t even leave  you didn’t tell me it’s final sale  etc ” Keep in mind  there are signs all over the store saying final sale AND I told her  times  I kept telling her over and over that I couldn’t exchange them  but would be happy to ring it up in a separate purchase for her  She wasn’t having it  She eventually slid her face shield up and spit in my direction  The spit landed on the plexiglass and not on me  but at that point I wasn’t taking it anymore  I’m not sure if she knew the plexiglass was there or not  but either way I was done  I called my manager over and calmly explained the situation to her before stepping back  Now  my manager is very mama bear type  If someone messes with her employees she doesn’t take it  She took one look at the customer and said  “you have  seconds to leave the store or I’m calling security to come in here and drag you out ” The customer was taken aback for a bit  but eventually grabbed the PJs she purchased and stormed out  Her daughters just looked scared and embarrassed of their mom the whole time  The store closed shortly after that  so I’m not sure if anything ever came of it  but let’s just say I’m glad I don’t work retail anymore  TL DR I told a woman I couldn’t exchange her purchase and she tried to spit on my face before my manager forced her to leave,3528,671
370,lbgtm9,1,29,Customer tries to throw me under the bus for  cents I work at a grocery store  I’ve worked at  grocery stores in the past year  I’ve only had one particularly bad customer at my last job  but this one tonight was the worst ever  Also I’m a teenager  I’m a cashier and I was running self check out tonight  A lady comes up to me and tells me that her  for   sale didn’t show up on the receipt  I ask her to hand me the item so I can check to see if the sale is in her system  It’s not and I inform her it’s not in the system and that I can go check for her  I ask her where she got it from and she seemed to get upset over that  so I just leave and walk up to my coworker to ask her  It’s right on the aisle  we check the sale and the expiration date  great the sale is there so we can go correct this for her  So my coworker  she’s trained in front desk  says she’ll handle it  She asks the customer if she’s already paid for it and says ”okay  there’s nothing more we can do  But we can take you to customer service to take it from there ” The customer lady turns to me and says ”Why’d you even try to help me  This was useless ” Which is it’s not because we got all the information she needs to get her refund  Our assistant manager is seeing this commotion and walks over and my coworker tells him she needs a refund  Okay  perfect  his problem now  So another customers walks up and tells me her sale didn’t show up either  At the same time  the previous lady comes up and accuses me of not giving her her receipt back  Now I have  upset customers  so I excuse myself and walk over to the desk to get help  I got so overwhelmed  and both the customers followed me  I manage to quickly tell another front desk person that this new customer needs help  The original lady starts complaining to my manager about the missing receipt that I stole and never gave back to her  I tell them I’ll go check for the receipt because I figured I set it down  She follows me again accusing me of stealing her receipt  I look for the receipt at the self check out stand  I can’t find it  I turn to the cashier who checked her out and ask her if she can print her prior transaction  She can’t because she’s had other customers  My ASM comes back because this lady is yelling at me in front of everyone  I have to dig through the trash for her receipt to see if it’s there  It’s not anywhere  This woman just gets more heated and starts screaming at me more and accusing me  I know now that I handed her back her receipt because I remember I handed it back to her when I went to go check the sale  My ASM is trying to calm her down  I ask if it’s in her purse because I see a receipt in her purse and she got so offended that I asked and handed me her purse  My ASM is like “no we don’t need to do that ” And tries coaxing her to the customer service desk to stop yelling at me in the store basically All of a sudden her receipts in her hand  amp  she’s still yelling at me that I didn’t give it back to her  Where’d it magically come from then lady   My ASM says we’ll get her her refund for   cents  amp  she corrects him and goes “no  cents plus tax ” She got her fucking  cents refund while bitching about me to my manager and how I’m incompetent  She finally leaves and then harasses my coworker from earlier about where to leave her cart  Everyone tries to console me and say it happens to everyone  My mom said I need to stop being such a pushover and verbal punching back  Others say I should’ve been more confrontational because I just stood there and took it  It costs nothing to be kind  but it also costs  cents to be a raging cunt  tldr  customers sale didn’t ring up correctly in receipt  I check sale  we inform her that customer service can issue her refund  She calls me useless for going to check the sale  She comes back and accuses me of not giving back her receipt  My ASM tries to get her to stop screaming at me and take her back to the desk  She continues to scream  then her receipt magically winds up in he hand  continues to accuse me  Gets her refund while complaining about how incompetent I am  Leaves  amp  harasses my coworker about her cart  Refund was  cents,4215,825
371,lb0vv4,1,28,For the Last Time Sir  We Don’t Have Diesel So this happened a week ago or so  and it’s still on my mind as one of the weirdest things to happen to me at work  And I’ve only worked at all for a year  so who knows what the future holds in store  pun slightly intended Some details to preface this  I work in a local convenience store  We sell snacks  tacos and chicken  delicious   and gas  not diesel  hence the title  Although we have the button and spot for diesel on the pump  we don’t actually have it   Also the large majority of our customers are regulars  The man in this story  henceforth known as Diesel Guy  or DG  was not a regular  None of us had ever seen him before  Also  obligatory on mobileSorry if this is long Cast Me  me obviCW  co workerDG  Diesel GuyIt was about pm ish and I still had to wait until midnight to go home  It was pretty slow that day  and my CW was going to leave in two hours to leave me by my lonesome except for the stocker  who’d be around the storeSo as I said  it’s slow  nothing to do  when in comes a guy I had never seen before  We get a lot of regulars but it’s not uncommon to see passerby and what not  He wasn’t wearing a mask but had a cloth over his face  His shirt was dirty and had what seemed to be oil stains  It looked as if he had just been working on a car or something  We get a lot of blue collar workers who come here  so it’s not uncommon to see people looking like that  Anyway  he walks up to the counter and pulls    bills out of his back pocket and places it on the counter  He says nothing and just stares at me  So I wait a moment to see if he says anything  Silent Me  Um sir  what is this forDG     Me  Sir DG   grunts Me  Is this for gas DG     Me  Para gasolina  Note   Many Spanish speakers in this are so I thought maybe he didn’t understand my English DG   vaguely points at gas pumps Ok we’re getting somewhere nowMe  Ok  which pump sir DG   silent Me  dónde DG   holds up two fingers and grunts Me  Ok so   in pump    Just trying to make sure DG     Me  cuatro en dos DG   grunts and leaves Me   shrugs and puts the money on pump  After that I turn to my coworker and ask him what the hell that was and laughed  He said he didn’t know laughed as wellSo  I can see on the screen of register that he’s pumping gas  so I assume that’s the end of it  It wasn’t  This next part is where two things happen  You find out why he’s called DG  He speaks  English at that He comes back in a moment later  half in the store  half out  He looks at me the following exchange happens  DG  Hey do you guys have diesel Me  No sir we don’tDG     Can you put diesel Me  We don’t have diesel DG  But can you put diesel Me  Sir we don’t have itDG  Ok but can you put some Me  We don’t have it sir  We don’t carry itDG  Can you put diesel Me  We physically do not have it sir  I can’t give you what we don’t haveDG     But can you put some At this point I was so frustrated and just ducked behind the counter and my coworker said he’d deal with it  He walks outside with the guy to figure out what happened  CW came back and told me that he had a hard time asking him questions because DG said mostly nothing  even if CW asked him in English or Spanish  Turns out the guy had already pumped the gas he needed  his car didn’t even take diesel  and that was that  Or so I thought  At this point  I don’t remember if I was I break or in the bathroom  but the point is  I wasn’t in the room when this next part happened  So to save time explaining  CW and DG had a similar conversation in which DG tells CW he thinks he pumped diesel and fucked up his car  CW tells him that he couldn’t have messed up his car with diesel because we don’t carry it  This exchange goes on for a while before DG says “you don’t have diesel ”CW  NoDG  Ok  walks out Apparently when they were outside DG said the same thing  realized we didn’t have diesel  To make a long story a little longer  DG was still in the parking lot with his hood open  messing with the engine  Turns out his car wasn’t working because it was over heated  He came in again and CW asked if he needed help with his car and basically had to play charades again to understand that the guy needed a gallon of water to cool of the engine  When CW finally asked if that’s what he needed  DG just walked out the door  CW got him some water  and the engine was cooled off  and DG left  The rest of the night was slow  but that moment made it interesting enough to not care as much,4594,872
372,lb091u,1,32,Card Declined   So I work at a local grocery store chain which has a gas station connected to it  At my town  a national gas station franchise is partnered with my store so our rewards system works with their store and their cards coupons will work with our store depending on the situation  This is important to know for the situation that happened yesterday   A elderly guest with a golf hat  Ill call him Golf Hat Man  GHM  from here on out  came up to the gas station  ready to be checked out  He handed out his card  a holographic green white card that I would usually have to use a different card reader on and then house charge it    GHM   You know how to do this right    Me   Of course   So as Ive said  I would have to use a card reader on my end that would take an amount out of the card and then I would have to house charge it from our system  I swiped the card  entered the amount and proceeded with the transaction  Card Declined  that rarely happens to me  so there must be something wrong with the system I assumed  I called one of my managers to come up and I told GHE that his card was declined   GHE   You said you knew how to work this    I responded telling him that I did know and I am have a manager coming down to support  I believe I also told him again that his card was still declining on my card reader   GHE   Well it seems that you store is false advertising  Clearly it would work at  National Gas Station     I was a bit confused at what he meant by that but it was obvious to me and my coworkers around that he was getting agitated  It was the worst of times for this to happen as well since a line of people was forming right behind him  He was talking about how he got this card and how it would work every time here and other places  around this time my manager came down wondering what was going on as well  She asked if his card was expired to which he looked around asking himself if it was expired   GHE   Look it doesnt say that it is expired at all     There wasnt a expiration date on there  dont think there are expiration dates on those cards so I couldnt blame him there  The situation wasnt getting nowhere  so he went and threw a hundred on the counter   A ripped one at that   Saying that we should get a supervisor being okay that he will go and get his gas somewhere else from now on  cant remember what my manager said but I said yes with no hesitation  He was getting me agitated at that moment  and while I wasnt cussing him out  thankfully  I was acting a bit of a smart ass    I remember the he said to me before he left   GHE   At least I know you name for next time Mr  Know it All  My Name     At that moment I decided  by my own principals  to not have my nametag out for the public  I know Ill get in trouble from my managers for that but Id rather not have another upset guest know about me more than I would want to have  My manager who was there apologized to me for having to take the blunt of GHE  I told her not to worry about it    Apologizes for what I think was a post that went a bit all over the place at the end  Usually I dont like to talk about stuff like this that happens in my life  it makes me feel like Im complaining  But with people like GHE around and a plethora of other people  it makes me glad that Im not alone but at that same time  during a damn pandemic of all things  we all deserve to be treated better than this,3446,685

374,l9zv28,1,104,Why does the birdhouse cost more than the treat  So a while ago I was working in a big chain store for pet supplies   A part of our stock was seasonal products  many of them for wild birds I was working the register on an average day  engaging the the occasional conversation with the customers  when an old lady comes to the register   I ring her up and tell her the total  and she pays with nothing out of order happening   She leaves  but comes back about  minutes later   I ask her if there was a problem  thinking maybe I had accidentally rung something twice or given her the wrong change  despite always being very careful In the following exchange  L is the Lady  M is the managerMe   Is there something else that you need    L       Well  you have typed in the wrong price    Me   Wrong price  Our prices are in the system  but I will have a look    L       See  this bird house is      Me   Yes  thats the right price  The ladys features darkened instantly L       No  you typed it wring  The price tag says its      Me    Oh  I dont think thats right  Can you show me the tag    L       Are you saying I am a liar   This is a scam  You are trying to rob me    Me   No  not at all  But maybe you looked at the wrong tag  A birdhouse cant be    Can you please   show me where you got it    L      This is fraud  You cant do this to me    Me    Please calm down  I will look at the tag    M     Hello  is there a problem    L      This boy is trying to rob me    Me   The lady says the price tag for this says    I asked her to show it to me    M       confused look    Alright  lets have a look then  The lady now finally shows us where she got the item   It was a big basket  with several items displayed next to each other and the pricetags for each one in the front L      See  It says       pointing to the small treats RIGHT NEXT to a bunch of similar birdhouses    Me   No  this is for the treats  Im sorry for the confusion  mam  but it is clearly labled The tags had the product names on them L      No  it was not laying with these  It was on top of these snacks  so this tag is the valid one    M     Well  some customer may have put it down there because its easier than to fit it back in  But this   is clearly not the correct tag  A birdhouse can not    L      I WANT MY MONEY BACK  I WILL CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW    M      Of course we can take the house back  but we cant sell it for    She went on screaming and the manager gestured me to go back inside   A few moments later they went inside  and the lady smugly held out the item   I did the return  gave her back her money and suppressed the urge to roll my eyes L     That will teach you  And I will NEVER come to this store again  She said in a victorious tone I couldnt help but grin widely at that Me   Oh I see  Have a great rest of your life then  She huffed  and puffed  and the manager and I shared a good laugh afterwards,2998,627
375,l9qce5,1,43,What kind of cigarettes are those  So this just happened  I live in the US and the specific state I live in is one that has legalized marijuana both medically and recreationally The store I work at has decided to capitalize on this by expanding the types of papers and wraps we sell  including cones  Cones are just preformed papers shaped well kinda like a cone  the narrow end contains a filter  though much different from a cigarette filter  and the wide end is open for filling The only brand we carry are Zigzag cones which come in a black and orange box  although a box of cones is as tall as a pack of the s size cigarette boxes they are only half the width  only  cones in a box  and theres a picture of an empty cone on the front of the box Had a youngish lady  just old enough to buy cigarettes  come up to the counter and shes looking at the cigarette selection when she asks  what kind of cigarettes are those  Those orange ones  I turn and point to the orange pall malls and ask  you mean these   The lady shakes her head  no up a few more rows and to the right Now Im confused bc the orange box pall malls are the ONLY orange box of cigarettes we sell  the only other orange anything were the zigzag orange papers and the black and orange box of cones which are right next to the papers    And did I mention they were only half the width of an actual box of cigarettes    So really skinny So I really didnt think they could actually be mistaken for a box of cigarettes but ask anyway if she means those bc Im out of other orange options and lo and behold thats exactly what she meant So then I had to explain that they werent cigarettes just empty cones and what they were for  she just ended up getting a box of L amp Ms and leaving,1779,331

379,l9fc83,1,25,TLDR  I had to teach a person how to use a phone I’m not the greatest storyteller  but this story was too good not to tell  Obligatory “sorry for typing on mobile” message here  I work at a tech retailer  We sell tech and tech accessories  and we also facilitate tech repairs  One day an elderly woman came into our store with a new phone  She said that when she answered the phone  people sounded really far away  and when she put them on speaker phone  it fixed the issue  This isn’t out of the ordinary  as manufacturing warranties are a thing and different parts of the phone are used for different functions  meaning one speaker could be malfunctioning while another speaker is fine  I decided to run a quick test for the phone’s audio  and it passed everything  I then decided to grab a store phone and test the issue with her in the store  I called her phone and she answered  leaving the phone on the testing bench  I waited for her to pick up the phone to talk to me  and she     MOTIONED FOR ME TO START SPEAKING   I spoke while in a state of pure confusion  She then put me on speaker phone  and said “see  that’s much better ” I asked her to put the phone up to her ear  and WOWZA  that fixed the issue  I then spent  minutes explaining how phones work  This was not her first phone either  so I have no idea why she never learned to put the phone up to her ear  as that’s how phones have worked since their inception,1435,272

385,l0yn4q,1,28,Customer strongly disliked the couple standing behind her in line  Happened around late summer of   Store was packed thanks to a mix of back to school shopping and the fall decorations that just came in  All lines at the registers were crazy long and you can bet it was quite stressful  as by that point I had only been working there for a month and a half Just as Im finishing up with my current customer  a woman with an annoyed look all throughout her time in line  straight up butts in and tells me to please tell the customers behind her to keep away from her  I took a quick glance and saw a middle aged couple simply having a conversation with one another  Judging by their appearance and attire  they were from India  All they were doing was simply talking in their native language  and it somehow rubbed this annoyed lady the wrong way She just slams her money and stuff on the counter while glaring daggers at these people for no real reason  Once the transaction was done  she snatched the receipt from my hand  scratching me at the same time   turned back to the couple and loudly yelled  STAY AWAY FROM ME  JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME   and then stormed off  leaving the rest of us confused as hell Looking back  that was one of the earliest Karen encounters Ive witnessed  It became evident she was trying to start some sort of drama and hoped Id take her side or something  I dont know lol,1413,258

387,kyxg26,1,105,Red or Green  Im blind   My first on the books job was at a grocery store  One day we had a regular who was entirely blind  and I helped him shop  He was a good guy I liked working with him  but I screwed up a few times  We were in produce and he asked about grapes  so I asked  red or green  I immediately was mortified but still was not sure how else to describe them  He tried a few and selected one or the other  I forget which I got him  but I made sure he had the freshest grapes in the darn store     By check out I had been descriptive enough that he had too many products for his bag  Apparently  he normally loaded his groceries into a large hiking backpack and walked home  I had simply described too many things that he liked  So  he needed to borrow the cart to get his groceries home  Normally carts were not allowed out of the parking lot  I walked with this man all the way to his home a few blocks away  The final mistake… I asked him if he wanted me to turn his lights on for him  I guess it did not matter    To this day I really hope that he did not hate me and that I was a good help,1112,229
388,kybgrl,1,0,Cell phone Or Death  I worked for an electronics retailer that is now out of business  It was ‘R’ in a circle  We had a young man upgrade his cell phone  No biggie  Per policy and law  it was all within his rights and he used a debit card  Note here that we are not required to check IDs with use of debit cards  After all he at least needs the pin to continue  The next day the store got a call  I took it and this young man’s father screamed into the phone about the transaction  It was a good  minutes before I could figure out what it was about because he was so incomprehensible  I warned other employees that he was coming in the next day  Instead  he went to another of our locations and pulled the same screaming act  I heard through the grapevine  He showed up the next day at our location the next day  He did not want a refund  He did not want anything else from us  His son stood there with a crap eating grin  What did he want  My best instinct told me  he wanted a fight  My co workers informed me that he clearly carried a knife which was clearly visible in his pocket  My district manager  DM  forbids us from calling the police  Well  I should have known that my DM was full of BS  but I did what I could  As I was qualified by my state  I was legally able to conceal carry a firearm  Here’s where things get fun and thankfully not violent  I explain to my co worker the situation and what is in my bag under the counter  He gets excited and does what no responsible gun owner would do  He goes in my bag and pulls my firearm out… as a customer walks in… and promptly walks out for obvious reasons    After that  it was clear that I could not keep my firearm with me with such an irresponsible idiot in the store  I figured that instead I could have a broom handle  I was taking kenjutsu  at the time so it made sense to me  a Japanese sword art   Apparently  another co worker leaked to this guy why the broom handle was behind the counter and this same idiot was pretending that it was a sword swinging it around the store… several customers walked out because of this  We could not even have the broom handle out here with this idiot…  Then he does the big reveal  He lifts his shirt and reveals that he carries a Glock every day  As a lifelong shooter  this is the one guy of a thousand that I would not trust with a thimble  let alone a firearm    Note  I would dearly love to share all of screamers info  He was truly scum of the Erath  I kept that receipt with his address in my consul for a couple years until the Army took me  I still want to see him destroyed,2592,507
389,kyavv2,1,45,Retail to MMA This is my second Reddit post  My first ran afoul of the rules here so I deleted it   Please forgive me and let me know if I am violating any norms rules  I’ll figure it out In collage I worked at an electronics retailer known for a big R in a circle   One crazy evening a guy showed up demanding a refund on an item  He had everything  even his receipt  By all rights  a refund was no issue whatsoever but if that were all I would not be here  He demanded cash but he originally paid with card  I explained that policy required that the return be done according to the method originally used to pay and specifically the card that he used  He angerly claimed that card account was closed  I explained that my boss could override that  but she would not be in until the next day  This back and forth continued for several minutes as this guy got angrier and angrier  Now it is important to note  this guy is roughly ’ ” and easily north of  pounds  At this point he produces the card he used  showing that he lied  Whatever  We did the return and he left  This is where it gets crazy  It was  minutes past closing by this point and we are anxious to leave  It’s just myself and a co worker when we hear this guy screaming obscenities at the sky  My co worker makes what I would consider a mistake  He goes out in front of the store to see what is going on  Almost immediately these  enter the chicken walk that macho people do squaring up to fight  It is important to note here  although I did not know it at the time  that my co worker was also an MMA fighter  The guy did that dumb bum tackle where he hunches over and charges my co worker who immediately puts the guy into a guillotine head lock  My co worker handles the guy like a cattleman might handle an ornery calf  There were no blows buy my co worker dominated while this guys wife came screaming out of his truck  I realized at some point in this that I was of no help  I wrote the license plate of the guy on my palm with a sharpie and called the cops  This is where is got scary  My co worker released the guy figuring that he was done  The guy lumbered back to his truck like a brain dead pachyderm  We thought he was trying to leave but he immediately returned and ‘stabbed’ my co worker with something he picked up from his truck  Whatever it was  it apparently was not a knife  After that  the guy and his wife take off  The cops arrive a few minutes later  They plugged his license plate number into their on board computer and the guy’s mug shot pops up on their screen  From what I can see  he was previously wanted for drug related offenses  I can only figure that he was high and thought that the object he grabbed was a knife  He certainly swung it like one  Because there was no actual injury  no charges were pressed  however  my co worker was arrested a few years later for running a human trafficking ring including torture of women  Did you see that coming  If the admins approve  I may add his name as it is public record and in the news  He will never leave prison     Retail is crazy,3103,588
390,kwyxky,1,31,Customer still thinks the battery is missing after I turn the dust buster on  Short story here  but it blew my mind today I work the customer service desk and one of my first customers today brought a Stanley dust buster to return  He said someone one must have opened it and stolen the  rechargeable  battery out of the box before he bought it  because it wasnt in there I opened the box  looked at the dust buster and the wall mount charger  and realized it looked like the battery was an internal battery  I told the customer   I think its an internal battery   and started searching the box for something saying as much  He wasnt being rude when he said this  but he said to me   I dont care what youre looking for  I just want to return it   I said   Alright  whatever you say  sir  As soon as I was done with the return  he said   If you find the battery  Ill buy it back   So I picked the thing up and pushed the power button  Sure enough  the little motor started and the dust buster turned on  I turned it off and said   The battery is internal  sir   He said   No  the battery isnt here   I turned it on and left it on  holding it up in plain sight  I said   Sir  its running   as he insisted the battery is still missing and was looking around as if he was going to find it on the desk  Myself  my associate next to me  and the customer she was taking care of were trying so hard not to laugh The guy eventually realized what was happening and bought it back  He had a good laugh at himself about it,1527,288
391,kwkzqf,1,12,Off Duty Cop Threatens Me  Ok so Im still at ShopRite and this incident happened like a month ago  now like most of the stories Im sending in today  I dont exactly remember what the guy was wearing but I do know his wife was wearing a sports shirt  football or basketball  I dont exactly remember  Anyway  the guy comes and I start his order  I then notice a can of tuna on the side of the belt and I asked the guy if thats his and if its apart of the order  He then yells at me that yes its his but its apart of another order  I then respond with an ok  We continue  I then notice that he took one of our empty bags and throw it in his cart   Side note  I can be a bit obsessive about the stores bags cause customers constantly throw out bags on the floor  throw them onto the counter and leave them there  throw them in their cart expecting to use it for trash at home and my coworkers constantly crimple up bags and throw them under the register or into the back of the rack or next to the box of bags under the register and I constantly have to clean them up because the store doesnt like bags going unused  Now back to the story  I ask the guy if hed like me to use the bag for his bread  he then rips it out of the cart and jams the bread in  I let it go  We then move on to the end and I look up at the guy  He then proceeds to ask me if Ive got a problem with him  I then tell him no  why  He then tells me that I seem to have an attitude towards him and I ask him what he means  He then tells me that I made a big deal because he didnt put the bread in the bag that I wanted and Ive been very rude to him  I then call a manager over  but instead one of our runners showed up and I asked her if she could get me one of the managers  She then told me that the only manager on duty was on break and I would have to wait  She then asked the customer what the problem was and he told her the same story he was telling me  I then proceed to interrupt and make it clear that he was the one that started the fight over a can of tuna that I was asking about and that he seems to have his own problem with me  The guy then asks me if I would act this way towards him outside of work and I said no  Why do you ask  He then tells me that hes a cop and he knows that I wouldnt act this way if I was outside the store right now  I then tell him that he did technically threaten to take me outside  He then tells me that its not a threat and he should know because hes a cop  The runner then tells me to stop and calm down and just finish the order and leaves  By then his wife shows up and asks what happened  The cop then proceeds to tell her the same lie and I corrected him  She then comments that the can was on another order and I said ok  Now at this point the cop knew that he had screwed up and proceed to apologize and claim that maybe he was just having a bad night or something  I then accepted his apology and he asks his wife if he can go sit outside  after getting confirmation he leaves and I completed his wifes order while answering her questions about the incident  and order ended  Now after this incident I havent seen the cop again and I hope I never do,3189,662

395,ksnxt9,1,87,Customer mad that he got something for free For context  I work at a grocery store where  when a customer uses their rewards card  every  rewards points equals either    off a gallon of gas at our companys gas pumps  or    off of a purchase  Most customers prefer the gas money since gas prices are expensive where I live  but occasionally Ill find a customer whos willing to go through all the tedious steps of turning their rewards points into a grocery discount  When the discount is transferred onto their card  it automatically comes off the next time the customer uses their card on a purchase Anyway  time for the story An older man  probably in his s  comes through my lane the day after Christmas  Hes pleasant  albeit a bit unenthusiastic  Whatever  its  pm  right after a major holiday  He probably just wants to go home  All hes buying is a sandwich from our in store deli  I go through the whole  Hi  how are you today   script as per usual as I ring up the sandwich  which is     I ask him if he has a rewards card he would like to use  He does  and I scan it  Then  I hit total I stare in confusion at my computer screen  I have dyscalculia  like dyslexia but with numbers   so at first I think Im just reading all the numbers wrong  But no  the computer definitely says     and there is a little message on the item list on my screen that says  GROCERY DISCOUNT       so I know Im not hallucinating  I smile pleasantly at my customer and say   You lucky duck  You had some grocery dollars on your card  and youre getting this for free  I thought hed be pleasantly surprised   its a Christmas miracle  He doesnt have to pay for his sandwich  But no  Instead  he frowns  I dont remember exactly what he said here but he was very unhappy his discount had come off of this purchase   Take off the discount   he tells me I blink   What   I ask him  trying to retain my customer service voice  I wanted to use my    discount on my grocery order next week  I dont want a discount on this  I want to pay for it  Hes getting belligerent  and Im getting nervous   I cant take the discount off  sir   I tell him  trying to stay pleasant   theres no option on my computer for that  Its automatic   Well  how do I get my    back on my card  then   Well  I can void this whole transaction and start over  and you dont have to scan your card this time  I just have to get my manager over to authorize   I dont want to wait  I think fast  I have a lot of options here  but none of them will make him happy  I decide Ill just shove him off on the people at the customer service desk  Theyd be able to help him a lot better than I would anyway   Here  Ill just go through with this transaction  then you can take your receipt over to customer service  pay for your item there  and get the discount put back onto your card  I finish the transaction  he doesnt thank me or say good bye  and I continue on with my evening  I still dont know if he ever got his discount put back on his card  nor do I know if he ever realized that the    he got discounted off of that sandwich was the exact same    he would have not had to spend on a future grocery order  Its the same amount of money  sir,3269,601
396,ks925r,1,52,I WANT MY MONEY BACK    This was over  years ago when my state had just started the lottery  Everyone had gotten excited about winning ‘easy’ money and we’re going practically crazy buying lottery tickets and scratch offs  I had walked into a gas station store where I used to work and talk a friend who still worked there  It was around pm and we were talking about all the insane stuff some of the customers would do when an older Asian lady walked in going straight to the counter  LFor the employee I’ll call him Brian  elderly Asian lady will be AL  and since I was observing  I’ll just tell the story as it happened  Brian  “Yes ma’am  may I help you ”AL   In broken English  “How much scratch off ticket ”Brian  “  each  ma’am ”AL  “I want  please ” She picked the card style she wanted and paid for them in cash  Brian counted out  twice to be sure in front of her  Brian  “Anything else ”AL  “No  thank you ” and she got her tickets and went to her car  Brian and I were watching her scratch the tickets  in her car and were talking about how it’d be funny if she won a large jackpot and wanted her money now  After roughly  minutes  AL came back inside with her tickets and walked up to the counter  AL  “I want my money back    ” and she slammed the now used tickets on the counter  “These no good    I want my money back   ”Brian looked at me  then to AL and had a surprised look on his face  “Uh  ma’am  I can’t  Once you buy them they’re yours  You can’t bring them back for a refund  They’re yours forever and ever ”AL gave Brian a look that could kill a bear in it’s tracks  then at me  We really expected her to loudly complain  but she just quietly walked out to her car  Brian and I were examining the tickets and found she had won money  but probably didn’t notice it or understand how they worked  As she started backing up  I ran outside to inform her she had money coming and to come back in for her winnings  She almost ran me over before stopping  After I told AL she had won some money after all  she got excited  got out of her car  and ran back inside  Meanwhile I put the car in park  Yep  she was that excited  Brian explained how the scratch offs worked and showed AL the money she won  It really wasn’t much of a win  though  She paid   and walked away with    It didn’t matter  She strutted out the door as though she won a million dollars  After that I left for home and never saw Brian or AL again  I like to think that maybe AL might’ve gotten the golden ticket later on  just like Charlie and the chocolate factory,2603,486

400,koqfa4,1,23,Glass Slipper Occasionally you get that one customer experience that just absolutely stumps you  This is mine I worked at a department store specifically in the shoe department  It was a bit busy but no one needed help at that time so I kept busy by put displays back into place A customer asks me where the restrooms are and I give them directions  My back is now turned to the display table  I feel someone tap me on my butt  it surprised the hell out of me  At first I thought that I had accidentally bumped into someone  not believing there was actually someone who would touch my butt in public I turn around to find a little girl looking up at me  She has a look on her face like she has something she wants to ask me but is a little shy  So I kneel down to come to her level She cups her hands around my ear and asks me secretly   Do you have glass slippers   No Im sorry I dont have glass slippers   I whisper back to her  She ducks under the table and I loose sight of her I laugh at myself for a bit  that was a very strange experience  A few minutes later I feel the girl patting my butt again  Before I go down to kneel she quickly points up To my surprise  and do you know  An all clear plastic high heel  kind of like one of those stripper heels  But hey it looked like a glass slipper  So I hand the shoe to her  She ducks under the table and this time I see where she had gone  Oh no sweety Mama cant wear these things   she laughs at her daughter   Huh  they are like glass slippers arent they  Everyday I saw those heels I had to laugh,1578,300

404,klrtvk,1,138,That time a guy wanted a printer for free because it had no price tag I used to work as a cashier at an electronics store a few years back and for some reason this interaction popped into my mind so I figured you all might enjoy it  Now just for reference our store on weekends basically was a skeleton crew of   people so often times I had to deal with customer questions until one of the tech guys or my manager was free  This middle aged man comes up to cash with this printer and tells me it has no price tag on the shelf  So I apologize and tell him I can scan it to check for him  He then makes everyones favorite jokes about how  It has no price tag so its free   I give him my customer service laugh and let him know that its about   Then he tells me that its actually free because there is no price tag and I explain to him that it doesnt actually work like that  He tells me that because we would change the price if it had the wrong price tag that it having no price tag is equivalent to it having a price tag of   which means that we need to honor our policy and give it to him for free  So again I tell him no I cant give him a printer for free and instead offer him a coupon for   off that I had  Then he starts calling me an airhead or something like that and repeats everything but in a much slower and louder tone like Im dense So I call my manager who is busy with a customer  After a few minutes my manager comes and more or less explains the same thing that I had just said  The customer looks shocked  tells us hes going to go to the police  calls me some degrading name and storms off while shouting that hell never shop here again  The following weekend I cashed him out and would continue to see him in the store for the next few years I worked there,1796,360
405,kilxxz,1,20,Old Air Force Vets can be cool  Some background before we begin  I am a huge car enthusiast whose very proud of my family heritage  mainly French and Italian  and have been to Europe a few times to be familiar with the cars there  That said  lets begin Its about ish  and Im at work at my local outlet mall working at a higher end audio brand  Its a mall that sees a TON of both local and international traffic  as there is an international airport about  miles away with busses that run direct to it from the airport   kinda legit when you think about it  We just started selling a brand new Bluetooth speaker that had plenty of hype behind it and was becoming quite popular as we were entering the summer months because of its loudness and outdoor usability  Enter Air Force Vet  now called AFV Me  Hi  welcome to the XXXX store  how can i help you AFV  well    I have an odd request  Me  What do you need   heard this line before  or so i thought AFV  Well    i need to take a product outside  you have a floor model i can take  Me  mildly startled  What do you mean outside  Our products cant leave our sales floor This gets the attention of my Store Manager  who now has his head turned to listen in on the conversationAFV  Well  i need to see if something fits    its a tight space   Mind you  this gentleman is older  maybe mid s into early s  From his demeanor  i could tell that even he knew this was highly irregular to ask to take a product out of the store floor without purchasing  but I could also tell he was an honest sort of guy  SM  store manager    walking over  what are you trying to do sir  AFV  I heard about this new speaker of yours and wanted to see if it fit in a space in my car  it doesnt have a stereo  and this speaker looks like it could fit perfectly in this space  Now my manager knows my affinity for cars  so when i looked at him knowingly and longingly  he gave the approval to go outside with the product and was basically told to guard the unit with my life  As we walked out to the guys car  we started talking back and forth  Turns out  he is an AFV from serving for nearly yrs at airbases in Germany and Italy  He served during the s s and lived there for a small while with his wife in Italy  They returned only recently and decided to bring his beloved car back from Italy with him  The Car  A beautiful all original s Fiat  in a glorious  tone red on black  It had been refitted with a power outlet to run a small fan  car was never built with AC or anything powered  with the original leather top as the only other source of fresh air  And it was tiny After discussing the car  we promptly looked in the center  Low and behold  the  space  was a near exact fit  with a power outlet to charge the speaker with right there  Car never had a radio in it to begin with  so this would be a huge upgrade over the deafening sound of tiny Italian engine noises  We give it a test right there in the lot in the car  AFV was relatively satisfied  but after all the excitement over seeing and being in this car  I wanted to seal the sale  I convinced him to start the car   at this point we were pretty chummy  so we could test the speaker with the native car sounds and see if the speaker could outdo the noise  Then  HE gets really committed   buckle in  lets go for a ride Without question  I buckled in  Next thing I know  we are now scooting around the massive parking lot of my outlet mall doing nearly  mph  the top speed of the Fiat  blasting the Eagles at full volume without any issues hearing the music  Im having a blast  loving every second of not only chilling with this incredibly nice gentleman  but also getting PAID to be in this car with AFV  About  minutes of racecar noises and reciepts later  he bought not only the speaker  but every optional item we had for it  minus a car charger since he had the power outlet already in his car  Easily the coolest day at work EVER  and one of the best customers I ever had,4049,760
406,kiegm0,1,29,That difficult customer I am new to the retail world of the department stores and I was at a register currently ringing another customer for their items  During that transition  two ladies with a stroller were browsing some items on a display and tried to ask for the price of the items while I was ringing my current customer for their items  I asked them if they could wait until I finished with the transaction before I could give them an answer  They showed facial expressions that were certainly displeased and even someone like me who has high function autism  I have a hard time recognizing facial  vocal tone  or body language expressions of peoples feelings or mood  could recognize instantly they were going to be troublesome  After I was finished with my customer  the two ladies came up to ask me to help them with a return  Unfortunately  the item in question had multiple return labels which made the transaction to return their item difficult and caused errors in the system  Looking at their item  I noticed it for another brand that has their own section in the store and asked them to visit their counter to get their item properly taken care of as I wasnt able to continue the transaction  The customer got much angrier as they did not want to wait in another line to get a return  but I told them I am unable to do the return as it was a brand item for a specific section  Both ladies got very angry yelling profanities and one of the ladies said she once worked for the company and knows how we do things and that I was incompetent and lazy and I should do my job  I almost lost my temper  but I firmly told her I couldnt help her as it was not part of my area in the department  Also I was a new hire for a month so I am limited in knowledge and training being thrown into the holiday seasonal hire   She demanded my manager which I tried but being in an area of the store where cell reception doesnt work I couldnt make a call to my manager  I was also too far from other employees to get help  During this time she and her companion were yelling additional profanities and name calling while waiting At that point  I was starting to get more worked up and just trying to get them to go away  I attempted to walk away   I have the right to refuse service if I felt in danger  as they kept bombarding me with insults  but they positioned themselves in a way where every direction I went they went to stand in front of me  Finally  another employee who was more knowledgeable than me happen to pass by and the womans attention turned to grab that other employee who could possibly do better than me an incompetent employee  I was trembling due to an anxiety attack coming up and the lady and her friend continued to make fun of me trembling and additional insults as my fellow coworker was problem shooting the issue  Apparently  it was a situation that needs to be overridden by a full time employee or manager  I found an opportunity to leave and politely excuse myself before going to the staff breakroom to breakdown  For an experience that lasted about  minutes  it left a deep impression on me and I still get worked up from it  How can someone who says they worked in retail  goes back as a customer and treat a retail worker like that  I am still wanting to be as helpful as I can be in retail  and take this experience as a harsh learning experience,3398,626

408,kdf1wf,1,16,Why are you doing your job while we shop  Dont know if this belongs here  If not delete it  So I work at a retail store as a maintenance worker and everyday were supposed to do a routine sweep of the store  Basically we take a big dust broom and go down the aisles picking up debris One day doing said job I came across not one but two Karens  Anyway the story goes as follows  Cast is  M  is me K  is Karen OK  is other Karen I was going down the aisles and went down the clearance aisle and low and behold there they were  Kids beside them K  Why are you doing that while people are shopping M  Sorry  I go about my job and dont even push my way past them but walk past them  OK  you got dirt on my sons feet  M  Sorry OK  Rude I almost wanted to ask her how apologizing is rude but didnt  Youd think that was the only time I saw them right  Well no     The next time I see them I was up at the registers getting ready for break and see a couple with a baby  Im a sucker for little kids and babies  I am standing there talking to them and who should be right behind me but the Karens K  Stop playing with that baby and move  I almost wanted to say  Oh so whos being rude now,1207,235
409,kd8fqh,1,109,Carts cant go on the escalator  So for some reason at the store I work at at least once a day a customer tries to take their cart up the escalator  Last week an elderly lady tried this and fell and broke her arm and cut her head open  We have signs posted at the top and bottom asking people not to do this but still every day you see someone taking their cart and having this surprised look on their face when they almost fall or their cart almost tips over  WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN  Maybe Im being judgemental or overestimating what people should know I feel like it should be common sense that taking a cart up an escalator might not have a good outcome  Another thing is they get angry when you tell them their not allowed to  Weve had customers call to file a complaint saying an employee told them they couldnt take their cart up on the escalator  Theyll be like they were rude about it  I understand no one wants to be talked to in a rude way but if an employee raises their voice or seems rude in a situation like that its because theyre trying to get your attention and express how dangerous what your doing is  Especially since weve had several incidents of people falling and then getting mad at us when theyre told we cant be held responsible because we have signs posted  Also this maybe unpopular but I dont think an employee should be required to smile and use their customer service voice when someone is doing something so reckless and not only endangering themselves but everyone else on the escalator as well  I just needed to get this off my chest because it is sooo frustrating to deal with on a daily basis,1647,307

411,k9xa7h,1,0,Do you take coupons  I was very early s working at a grocery store as a cashier   There were two guys  Id guess late s early s  I think they were roommates  who were regular customers but I rarely had them in my line   They would purposely pick lines with female cashiers and then try to flirt with them   I didnt understand their behavior until one Sunday morning they came through my line and asked the question  Do you take coupons   with the most smarmy of smiles   I naively replied  Of course  we take both  lt store gt  coupons and vendor coupons  and one of them hands me a stack of coupons   I look at the first one    off a specific coffee    Oh  you didnt buy this coffee so I cant take this coupon    next coupon   Oh  this is the same coupon as the first so I would have only been able to take one  if you had purchased that coffee   as I quickly go through the rest of their coupons only to determine that none of the coupons were for items they were buying   I looked at them confused as I handed the stack back to them and the really smarmy guy says  All the other cashiers take them   Cant you do us a favor and be a sweetie for us    Thats when I figured out the flirting that had been going on   What they didnt realize is that I know fake flirting when I see it and it wasnt going to work on me    Sorry  I should have explained that I can only take coupons for items that you are currently purchasing   Do you have any of those  Shockingly  they never came through my line again,1525,299

413,k6n62t,1,197,But I need formula for my baby  Are you sure  Ive work in a supermarket for  years  You get your share of Karens and the only thing you can do is smile politely But what I even hated more after an  hour shift and having to close up the supermarket were the customers who came in   minutes before closing and just do their shopping like no one wants to go home There was a time that I was scheduled every Friday closing shift and pretty much every Saturday closing shift  The store closed at   We werent open on Sundays then  Also on Saturday we had to take out all the cash drawers and   manually  count all the money   We could start doing this when all the customers had left and the front and back doors were locked So customers coming in  to  minutes before closing time and taking their sweet sweet time to shop were hated  Hated with a passion My shop had a procedure  We would barricade our entrance and turn our front door on only opening when people wanted to leave the store at about  minutes before closing  We would remind customers at a quarter to   to and  to closing time that the store was going to close and please go and pay for their groceries Normally we had very few incidents This one   however  is burned in my memory C   colleague  FM  formula man It was a Saturday  As head of the cashiers for that night I had the honour to make or break the day of our beloved customers  I had to deal with my fair share of Karens  male and female  and I just wanted to go home So I follow the procedure  ask one of my fellow money handlers to set the front door and stay there to handle any customer At  minutes before closing time a man comes running to the door  My colleague asks what he needs and  reminds him that the store is going to close and he wont have much time  He says he just needs formula Since I was busy with a customer she let him in Guy gets a basket and goes into the shop  Since he said he needed formula we thought he would be in an out like Road runner  Nope No  because FM didnt need formula  At   FM is seen at the cheese section if our store    at our wine section  What the heck does he need that for Several of my colleagues have gone to this man to get him to the counter  He scoffs  huffs and says that hes a paying customer  My fellow money handler was the last one to go to him and thats when he went too far  He yelled at her  cussing at her and making a high school student cry  Now Im pissed  So I do what I always do in these situations  I take if my store shirt  put out a neat jacket I keep in case of emergencies and put it on  You see  when you have the store outfit on  you are often seen as a lesser being  But behold  I change my outfit and suddenly I look like management and my word is all powerful  The real manager sees this happening  pops out a huge grin and goes to the back and watch from the security cameras So I don the magical outfit and go to FM   I tell him in no uncertain  terms that the store has been closed for  minutes and he has been asked multiple times to go and pay for his things  He starts to huff and puff himself up like the big bad wolf   Im  woman and people think they can intimidate me   I told him that he was only allowed entrance since he said he needed formula  So I gave him a choice  He could go now and pay for the things in his basket or I would take the basked from him  grab rhe formula he claimed to need so much and he could pay for that He could choose not to do either  and in that case security would love to make his acquaintance  Either way  he would leave now He tried  oh boy he tried to threaten and intimate me He failed  He left   with his cheese and wine  And many threats to call corporate The best week he came again  This time he encounters me at the door  What did he need  Formula So I brought him to our service desk  went inside and brought out a single pack of every kind of formula we had  Asked him which one he needed He didnt say a word and left  Dont mess with our closing times,4083,792
414,k6fbde,1,38,Customer had a huge shouting match with a co worker over    Hailing once again from the arts and crafts store I used to work at  this event happened on one of the slower days in early spring of   It was just me and a co worker up front  I was a cashier and they were the front end supervisor  FES for short  of my shift  In comes a customer with a large bag of electric candles she wanted to return  No problem  If the items still functioned  that meant a full refund  so we tested each candle  Only one of them didnt turn on even with new batteries  FES made sure to mention that that candle in particular wouldnt be returned  and as she headed out back to get some more change for my register  the customers mood soured almost immediately This woman angrily mutters  who does this  year old think she is    She was referring to the FES  who at the time was   Keep in mind these candles are worth just    each and this woman got furious  When the FES returned with the change  customer demanded shed get the full refund for the broken candle regardless  and immediately began to shout every insult she could at her  FES did not hesitate to snap right back while still keeping a big smile on her face  but you knew she was furious by just how red her face was  I was watching on in silent disbelief at how sudden this entire thing escalated Customer got even louder and angrier  to the point surrounding customers immediately noticed  Some went as far as defending us while bashing this crazy woman for her unnecessary and extremely rude behavior  Customer simply shouted angrily at them as well  and it got to the point the manager and assistant managers went to the front to see what was going on  The shouting could be heard throughout the entire store  Crazy lady tried to make it seem like both myself and the FES were in the wrong  I stayed quiet throughout this massive shouting match yet I was somehow to blame as well  Karen logic  When the lady realized no one was taking her side  she stormed off  leaving the candles behind without the return being completed  all while threatening to sue  She never came back,2146,388
415,k6e4c0,1,17,Self admittance to being a scalping piece of shit This happened today  So I had a customer come in asking me to help her out with her internet modem and set her up with a new modem or send out a technician to help her out  No problem  I ask her how her day went and if she did anything for Black Friday  She tells me she got a PS for her kid  Here’s where I may have fucked up  I asked her “oh where did you get it from ”Her response  “oh I didn’t get just one  I got five ” She explained to me that A few different Fred Meyers in our area had each restocked for in store purchases only for Black Friday Saturday She immediately saw my eyes wide open and she just kept flexing on me that she got five and started rubbing it in  I almost cancelled her entire transaction because I thought to myself  you scalping piece of shit  But then I realized  I have to be professional and I’m making money off this transaction so I kept my cool  finished the transaction and immediately started calling the places she said were restocked  for Black Friday  and basically left before we could finish speaking Moral of the story  fuck scalpers,1154,212
416,k6cewi,1,2,Customer calls about our deals  then asks about how were handling COVID and then says we deserve to be shut down  I hope this belongs here  I work in a restaurant and I am posting this on behalf of my manager  with permission of course  who got a call this morning twice from this woman For reference  I work at a popular wing restaurant  We dont open until am and per our state gov  we are to always close at pm  Ill tell this from my managers POV as well I got a call this morning from a woman at around am who was asking a lot of questions about our menu and our deals for today  and then asked how we were handling social distancing and safety precautions and sanitizing  etc  She ends on her last question and seems satisfied with her answers  we hang up and I think thats the end of it  Not even ten minutes later the same woman calls back and says that we are not handling the pandemic correctly at all  then proceeds to tell me we should be shut down permanently and that we are stealing all of the business from small shops around town and that our corporation is evil  I explain to her that I am running the store as I am told  and I offer her the number to corporate because she seems genuinely concerned by this and it is in fact her right to make a complaint  She continues to interrupt  I ask her if she has been in our restaurant and if something has happened  She told me she has never step foot in our restaurant and never will  again  still refusing the number to corporate and continuing to insist that I am evil and I am the sole reason small businesses around the world struggle  Eventually I get tired of he ranting and I tell her without allowing her to interrupt again that I am running the store per corporate  that I have no say in how we run our business and am not allowed to close the store  I inform her again that she can have the corporate number and give it to her  tell her to make a report  I apologize and said that I hope this pandemic ends soon so that you wont feel the need to call and harass businesses anymore since you feel so strongly about how we practice our business  have a nice day and hung up She never called back,2181,417
417,k5kpqi,1,19,Will this break   I was working in an area that sold dining ware  We had different types of ceramic  including Stoneware  which may have been made of ground rocks     long time ago  and was more dense and less elegant than most of our ceramics  This guy picks up a stoneware dinner plate in his hand and is kind of weighing it  He asks   Will this break  Me   Yes  even though it feels solid  its still ceramic  Guy   It doesnt feel like it would break  Me   I mean  anything will break if you drop it  Guy   I bet it wouldnt break if I dropped it here    Onto our wood floor  Me   I assure you  it will break if you drop it  This man looks me straight in the eye  stretches his arm out in front of him  and lets go of the plate  It hits the ground exactly parallel to the floor  creating some kind of vacuum effect that made everyones ears pop  and the pieces went flying further than I have ever seen This adult man  dressed like hes on his way home from the office  just looks so surprised that he made a massive noise and exploded ceramic all over the store  and dented the floor  He was then really apologetic and insisted on paying for the plate  Though we would normally never ask for money for customer damage  I let him pay  We cleaned up immediately  but we were still finding bits of that plate in odd corners of the store for weeks afterward,1378,248
418,k5j7xh,1,0,Customers that stare So I work in a smoke shop  dealing with quite a variety of people  Most customers are surprisingly nice but I do get the occasional Karen or Ken  But I can deal with them easily  my problem lies in my anxiety that I’ve suffered from since middle school  This job has helped me face my anxiety and get better at managing it  But stares still get me hard  and I don’t mind if you’re staring at me across the room waiting for me to help you  My anxiety spikes when I’m cashing you out and you’re inches away as I handle the transaction staring me dead in the eyes  Like I can feel your gaze burning into my soul  it makes me extremely uncomfortable  There’s so much to look at around you and most customers do look around as I handle everything  But some just stand in pure silence  barely responding to my small talk and stare  I’ve gotten the most mean and judgmental stares from older middle aged women  I just look up for a second and see mean eyes staring right at me  I’m really quick at counting money and using my ancient register  I can’t scan items so I need to remember all of the prices  insert the tax for all the items being purchased  It takes just a minute and I feel like these customers are upset I take an extra few seconds to cash them out then what they are used too  Most just stare at my hands watching me push dozens of buttons in a quick fashion  but some people just need to look right into my face making me lose focus on my complex register  Anyone else experience this kind of thing  Do you get used too it,1560,298
419,k5iw3o,1,17,Though this happened years ago  this still sticks with me  I’ve worked at a grocery store for over five years now  This story happened within my first year  I think    but it’s by far one of the kindest things that’s ever happened to me I found out my childhood best friend committed suicide  and I was devastated  I was heading back inside from loading a customer’s groceries in their car  I was visibly sad  and a man noticed  He asked me what’s going on  I explained to him what happened  He then takes my hand and he prayed for me  When he finished  I thanked him When I got inside  I burst into tears  I got so emotional  I had to go home  That man was by far one of the kindest I’ve ever met at my work  That day will live with me forever,749,143
420,k4xt8y,1,85,Grandma’s Ripe Avocados  Not as interesting as some of the stories I’ve read here  but it was memorable at least  It was my first week working at a big  widely known grocery store and my department was online grocery pickup  Because it was my first week  I was scheduled to be doing a little bit of everything so I could be trained in every area of the job  Helping with online orders that weren’t grocery  picking the grocery orders  and doing the actual job of taking the groceries outside to customers  On this day in particular  it was only my first or second time actually picking out groceries without the person who was training me  I was minding my business in the produce section  trying to remember all the info crammed into my head over the span of a day and a half  when someone right next to me half shouts  “Do you  work here  ” I look over  scanner in one hand and produce bag in the other  and Cranky Grandma is staring me down  “Yes  can I help you find something ” She holds up her opaque produce bag and gestures wildly to the avocado shelf near us  “ Are these ripe  ” I stare at her and try to comprehend what in the fresh hell is being asked of me  I’m not an avocado farmer  I don’t even like avocados    all of those avocados could be expired for all I know  I answer truthfully  “I’m new so I’m not actually sure  but I’ll be happy to find that answer for you ” She stares at me and goes  “I just want to know if they’re ripe ” I stare back for a moment and look around uncertainly until I catch the eye of my coworker who seems to have heard what’s going on  She comes over to help  “Is there something you need help with  ma’am ” Cranky Grandma turns to her and shakes her opaque bag of avocados once more  “I just need to know if these are ripe ” My coworker begins to answer but before she can even get a full sentence going  Cranky Grandma turns to the shelf of avocados and promptly dumps out her produce bag  She turns to my coworker again  “Where are your  fresh  walnuts  Not bagged   fresh  ” At that point  I turn and go anywhere but there so I can let out my laughter in peace  I eventually learned to deal with difficult customers  but truly didn’t realize how crazy people really were until my entire half a year at that awful job,2308,426
421,k4o4iy,1,1,Customers are always right even when its against store policy apparently During my time working at an arts and crafts store  the store went through  managers  This manager in question was    and thats what well refer to her as    had this very sweet persona and a big smile all the time  but she was the manager that always gave customers what they wanted even though it was against company policy  This included allowing customers to use multiple coupons when it was always just one  per person  per day It goes without saying that its practically a universal retail experience to run into people that believe the rules simply dont apply to them for whatever their given reasons are  What makes it worse  at least in my opinion  is when managers approve of this sort of behavior by giving them what they want anyway  It makes the rest of us feel like theres no point in enforcing the rules when theyll just be broken anyway  and make us look like morons in front of the  usually  rude customers Recapping from my previous post  this was the same manager that approved the return of holiday items after the holiday had passed  which was against the companys policy  In another instance  she approved the return of clearance items  All clearance items at the store were labeled with price stickers of a different color and would show up as such when scanned  Customers were always informed of this at the time of purchase and it was also listed on their receipt  The only exception to this rule was if you were returning an item that wasnt clearance at the time you bought it  As long as they have the receipt to prove it  it could be returned no problem  If the customer was a rewards member  the transaction itself could be pulled up by their name and scanning the item in question    would still go ahead and approve a couple returns of those that already bought the items on clearance In what I feel is the most memorable instance  this habit of   got so bad she even allowed the return of an item that wasnt even sold by the store  but by a competitor arts and crafts store  Yes  you read that right  It was so baffling that even now it still gives me a chuckle,2191,394
422,k4mn6v,1,25,Why Even Have A Return Policy  Id like to preface this story by saying I generally like my boss  Hes a pretty chill guy  he backs me up on a lot of stuff and will step in to handle things if customers start getting mad  Unfortunately  he does have his moments of being spineless  This is one of them I work in an outdoor clothing shop  and our return policy explicitly states that clothing that has been washed is no longer eligible to be returned  Like  minutes before close one night  guy rolls into the store with a return  Being the doorman  I chat him up and ask what hes in for  and he says he washed this shirt and now its too small and he wants to return it  I tell him upfront that I dont think hell be allowed to  but he can go up to the counter and find out for himself  I radio ahead to let them know this one is gonna be a doozy My manager tells him he cant return it  Dude proceeds to throw a classic tantrum  like  what do you mean  it doesnt fit me  I dont wanna keep this  blah blah blah  and he proceeds to storm out yelling  You just lost a customer  over his shoulder  I start making fun of him with colleagues  as you do  and he storms back in to demand the regional managers name and number  Presumably so he can waste his time bitching about how we wont bend policy for a   shirt My managers spine suddenly vanishes and he decides to just give this dude what he wants to get him to go away  He looks up the dudes receipt    and then it hits him  The dude has been claiming this whole time he bought an XL shirt  and that after washing it doesnt fit  cant get his arms through the sleeves  My boss looks at the receipt  looks at the shirt  and realizes this dude bought a large  and tells him I wasnt there to personally witness this moment  but apparently the dude just absolutely deflated  All the wind went out of his sails in an instant  He was very quiet for the remainder of the exchange  as my manager proceeded to comp him an XL of the same shirt  I was not a fan of my boss in that moment  but the sheer thrill of learning this dude was this angry over the wrong thing kinda cancelled it out,2150,414
423,k4h4mn,1,182,Wrinkly ten dollar bill I got out of my retail job in October but I wanted to share my last insane customer story  It was a Wednesday afternoon in your average discount clothing  homegoods and doorknob store  I was ringing up a lady and her daughter  Her total came out to   and she hands me a    I go in my drawer and handed her a   from the top of the stack and close the register  I was working quickly because I had worked there for long enough that I could do that with little mistakes  and because we had a line building up  This lady looks at her bill and goes  excuse me can you give me a nice    And I inform her that unfortunately we are not allowed to open the drawer after it has been closed   Its fine  Ill wait  call the next customer and you can give it to me then  she says  I informed her again that I would not be able to open the drawer for her  She tells me to call the next customer  she can wait  So I look back at my manager who comes over  I explain the situation and she again informs the lady that I could not open the register  and I was not allowed to switch out bills on different transaction Im telling yall   its like we told her we killed her entire family with the machetes we sold  She starts screaming about how I gave her a  raggedy ass bill  and how it was going to rip and then what is she supposed to do  Shes not going to use it right away  She then yells  she took my nice twenty pretty damn fast  and it took all of my strength to not react because what the hell is she accusing me of After she left I had to take a couple of minutes to just stare out the window trying to process what the fuck just happened,1672,333
424,k4ekr6,1,2,Do you need to be let in  Serious question here  if the main doors to my store are locked  do I need to let a customer in  A few nights ago  me and another coworker were closing and I had locked the door as it was already   minutes past our closing time  I had finished closing the register and coworker was putting things away in the back  all normal  Suddenly  a guy comes up to our locked door and just stands there  Our front lights were off aside from a small one by the register that was always on  so to most people it’s easy to tell we weren’t open anymore  He starts to knock and my coworker asks if we need to let him in  I told my coworker we don’t legally have too I think  After a while the guy leaves but this is where my question strikes  Did it need to let that guy in  I didn’t think I had too but now it’s got me thinking  If someone could tell me that would be great,889,180
425,k48qag,1,7,Out of Old Fashioned I work as a baker at a grocery store  covering just about all of the baked goods we sell  from bread  to muffins  to   donuts  We don’t always have every kind of donut  and some are more popular than others  so I try to give as much variety as I can and spice things up a little to compensate  That being said  as you all are probably aware  you can’t always please everyone After baking  I work on packaging bread near the counter of my station  opening myself up to the customers and making me vulnerable to questions  that of which I do not mind  Especially in the morning hours  people usually aren’t too keen on talking much  so interactions are pretty quick and painless  Today  however  our star of the show surely did bust out a performance At the sound of an “excuse me ”  I made my way over to help as soon as I could  However  before I could greet the customer  I was asked  “Do you have any of the plain donuts ” Well no  no we didn’t  Sadly  that’s one of the more popular ones  so we were still waiting to get that restocked  Not only that  but my manager had made a point to tell me that we were out of the old fashioned  so I apologized and broke the bad news He didn’t like this much He began explaining to me what an old fashioned donut looked like  and although I was completely aware already  I heard him out and apologized once again about the lack of that kind of donut in our stock  “Can you go check ” He would ask me  which would make me pause for a moment  Hypothetically speaking  if I did manage to find some old fashioned in stock  the man would find himself waiting there for up to an hour and a half waiting for me to proof them and fry them for him  and not only was I sure this man did not want to spend any more time there than he had to  but I didn’t want to take away space from the other bakers just for one tray of donuts that I was sure we didn’t have anyways I calmly informed him of my position and how I had been adamantly insisting on a restock  in which he replied by demanding for a manager  To be frank  my shift was  minutes away from being over at this point  so when I gleefully fled off to retrieve a manager  I didn’t bother returning to my station for any longer than I needed to clean it off  While I stood cleaning  I heard my manager tell the customer the same thing  in which the man proceeded to melt down about it in front of my manager  Night shifts can really tear at a woman’s soul  so I didn’t bother to witness the chaos that pursued after that  taking the long way through the back doors to the break room in a successful attempt to avoid another encounter  I saw my manager later on  too  so luckily  he survived as well,2724,519

427,k41o2x,1,21,Why Dont People Read the Signs  This happened last year in the final weeks before the store I worked for had to shut its doors for good  Two months before the day  we received all of our going out of business signs  The big  CLOSING  banner for the exterior  about a dozen signs to put around the store  super low discounts on all our remaining merchandise and whatnot  Though our store wasnt super popular  it was more of a word of mouth store since it didnt advertise on TV or radio   some of us were surprised to hear the store mentioned on the radio and some news reports in the months before we closed At this point  we had an increase of customers  new and regular alike  who wanted to get their hands on what they could before all the good stuff was gone  In this time  some employees jumped ship and either found new jobs or returned solely to their main jobs since this was a side job for them  It was sad to see them go  but it was for good reason  The manager hired on some seasonal employees to help fill the gaps and we sure needed it  especially with the holiday rush coming We put a sign on the front door in big lettering of the last day we would be open  One shift I had in the middle of the afternoon  a young woman  maybe  or so  came in to ask a manager if we were hiring  I was one of the managers in charge and politely told her we werent as our store was closing one months time  She seemed surprised and asked me she didnt know  I told her about the bold lettered sign on the front door and to look ANYWHERE in the store about the store closing discounts  There were even a big yellow and black signs behind the register counter I was standing at The young woman  I kid you not  actually said  Ohhhh   You know that kind of  ohhhh  someone says after you had to explain a joke that went clear over their head  I told her the few stores in the plaza I knew were still hiring for the holidays and wished her luck in her search I wish I was joking when I say this happened at least three more times during my shifts  A young woman walked in the store  sometimes with a resume at the ready  asking if we were hiring  As politely as my tedium could muster  I told them we were closing and that the sign on the front door CLEARLY says when were closing  By this time  it was maybe two weeks before Christmas  and even if we werent closing  most places  dont do hirings during the crunchiest of crunch times anyway  I still wished the ladies good luck on their job hunt  knowing full well job searching is a job in and of itself How    HOW do these people not see these enormous yellow  red and black store closing signs  HOW  I ASK YOU   I wouldnt hire them anyway because they clearly dont read  Understand that I respect and give mad kudos to anyone going out there trying to get that cheese  but COME  ON  Were CLOSING  FOREVER  Read the SIGNS  Theyre here  theyre there  theyre EVERYWHERE for a reason  You would get one or two paychecks at most if we hired you on THAT DAY  And as for TRAINING a new hire when were already slammed  Aint nobody got time fa dat   sigh,3122,583

429,k3paxy,1,16,Customer expected an apology after getting what she wanted Happened at the arts and crafts store I used to work at  The company had a policy that seasonal items such as Christmas decorations could not be returned after said holiday  Customers are told this at the time of purchase and its also listed on their receipt  Doesnt stop some folks from trying to make such returns anyway  One such event happened the week after Christmas two years ago  Lady wanted to return some wreaths  but wasnt having it when I explained the policy to her  Assistant Manager came over and explained this to her as well  Lady got pissed She began spouting some non existent law stating that such returns were allowed  and her attempts at finding it on her phone failed because again  such a law doesnt exist in our state at least  Lady still thinks shes in the right  In comes store manager  who after being told of the situation  went ahead and approved the return anyway even though it was against company policy  As is routine with returns  an extra receipt is printed for the customer to sign Not only did the lady feign ignorance by asking what she was supposed to do  it clearly had a big line for signatures   she went ahead and told both me and the Assistant Manager that there was something else we were supposed to be telling her  She was expecting us to apologize  I had been silent throughout that whole mess but I was fuming  Assistant Manager and I simply exchanged glances and he left to perform other tasks while I merely called for the next customer in line without even looking at this Karen  She got the hint and left without saying anything else,1656,292
430,k3mt54,1,8,No  there isn’t the size you want One of the things we sell in the store are shoes  and for certain shoes there aren’t a half size to begin with  Guy asks if there is a size EUR   for a certain shoe  I tell him that we don’t have that size  Guy asks  “Then how come other shoes have half sizes ” I explain to him that I’m not sure  since I’m obviously not the one who made the shoe  just that we don’t have it in the first place  He still persists  saying “How is that even possible  Did you even check  I didn’t see you check ”I brought him over to the counter  and key in the code for the shoe  Of course  that size doesn’t show up  Even after showing him  he says he can’t believe it and asks me to go in the stock room to check  I went in  and of course didn’t help him check because I’m checking for something that doesn’t even exist  I come out in a minute or two  and tell him there really isn’t that size Guy gets increasingly annoyed  asks me to check if other stores have that size  I kept explaining to him that there was never this size made for this certain shoe  and even if he were to go every other of the same store he wouldn’t be able to get it  I even offered him to try a  or  instead  but he just kept whining about how it wouldn’t fit and that he needed    Finally after several minutes of his whining  he called his wife  and told her I was being rude when walking out the store What would he have had wanted me to do  Make a custom shoe size for him and him only,1503,301

450,k1yq1b,1,555,I wanna hear all your experiences standing up to a customer  I try my hardest to not say anything back but sometimes it slips out  A few days ago a middle aged man climbed up one of the staff’s ladders to grab an item from the top shelf  We don’t allow customers to climb up on the ladders due to safety reasons  I saw him move the ladder as I thought he was just moving it out of the way so he could look at the other items  which he did  Then a minute later he climbed up the ladder to try and grab an item  I was in the middle of serving of a customer when I noticed  I quickly finished the customers transaction then I walked up to him and told him politely  “I’m sorry sir but I’m afraid customers aren’t allowed to climb up on the ladders”  He gets annoyed and says “you saw me move the ladder and didn’t say anything  now you want to say something ” I say to him  “I understand but I thought you were just moving the ladder out of your way to have a look at the items the ladder was blocking”  He then says to me condescendingly  “are you really arguing with me right now ”  Me  “no sir  I’m just trying to tell you that customers aren’t allowed to climb up on the ladders because of safety reasons and because the ladder also does have “staff only” marked on it”  Customer  “keep arguing with me and I’ll have your career ended”  I look at him blankly while him and his daughter carry on about how I shouldn’t be arguing with the customer  I went back to the checkout to serve a customer  His daughter waits in the line  She comes up  throws all her items at me with immense attitude  wouldn’t respond or look at me when I asked if she was paying with card or cash  I gave her receipt and she snatched it off me then says  “you’re lucky he didn’t complain”  I was already having a rough day because of Black Friday sales and whining customer after whining customer  I told her to go ahead and complain  She looks at me in surprise and paused for  seconds  She then asks for my name and last name  I gave her my first name  She then asked for my last name  me  “sorry I can’t give you that information”  Daughter  “no worries  I’ll just describe you to head office  blonde and brown hair  with a tattoo  I’ll be filing a complaint about you” me  “lovely  have a nice day”  She stormed out cussing and carrying on  I didn’t mean to respond but I honestly had just had enough that day  I want to hear your experiences responding back to difficult customers fellow retailers,2482,475

452,k17hda,1,22,My thoughts go out to anyone working retail over the next few days  I’ve been there  I remember working at a grocery store in the late ’s   It was the day before Thanksgiving The store was in an affluent area of town  full of yuppies  Most customers weren’t too bad  but per capita  it was “Ken and Karen” ville  The women were in ‘Yuppie Camouflage’  They wore beige tans  beige suits  beige makeup  and beige nails  This was several years before the ‘I want to speak to the manager’ haircut  but the attitude was there  So we’ve got high strung customers  during a high stress holiday period  doing last minute shopping before the feast with all the relatives  They were already on the verge of meltdown because most customers have multiple carts  and the last carton of that particular brand of whatever hard to find ingredient required for Great Aunt Lucy’s casserole is melting in someone else’s cart The store was packed and the front end of the store was gridlocked  The customers who weren’t ready to check out couldn’t maneuver very well because the checkout lines extended into the aisles I was a hapless clerk just trying to keep the customers from going ballistic while trying to check out their order  Beep   beep   beep  I had just completed an order and was getting ready to run the credit card  I hit the button to activate the reader  I swiped the card and it took a long time to process  Eventually it beeps and gives an error  I tried again  No dice  The customer was getting impatient  I paged a manager to do a manual override  and process the card manually  We still had one of the old fashioned credit card plates and a stack of the carbon blanks  specifically for emergencies like this  The manager processed the card  I finished ringing up the order and proceeded to the next  One of my coworkers paged the manager to process their card order  and then another and another  The credit card system had gone down The manager was running ragged back and forth between the registers trying to keep up with the orders  To try to placate the crowd they got some bag boys circulating through the crowd with cookies from the bakery  The front office manager was on the phone with the support staff at HQ trying to get the credit system back on line  After what felt like hours  the credit system finally came up  we got the customers checked out without too many riots  and I was finally able to punch out I don’t envy you this year  Stay safe  hold onto your sanity  and I hope you at least get a few hours off to enjoy Thanksgiving with your family,2587,453

466,jz0zdo,1,7,Customer abandoned their baby in the store  didnt come back for over  minutes I work at a shoe store in a mall and this happened in the summer of    The store is fairly big and has many isles   These isles are at about ft high so generally  people can see overtop of them   It is very common for people to come in with their children in strollers and leave them close by while they try on shoes or look around   This is why when there was an abandoned baby  now to be referred to as Kevin  in the store  the staff didnt think much of it   That is until we noticed that Kevin was in his stroller was all alone with no family around for an extended period of time   Kevin could not have been any older than  months  Im guessing that he was probably three months old   We instantly informed my manager that Kevin seemed to be abandoned   Thats when she started rolling it around the store asking if Kevin belonged to anyone   She then ran into a customer that just so happened to be an off duty officer who informed us that we should call mall security   He stuck around and started asking everyone on staff if they had noticed anything about Kevin or the family   After putting our stories together  we realized that one coworker had cashed out the family  unaware that they even had a child  and they had left without Kevin   We took Kevin to the back room until security came   Kevin was visibly upset  so with permission from the off duty officer  the manager picked Kevin up trying to calm him down   Thats when the family rushes in  visibly angry at my manager    Keep in mind Kevin had been left in the store for at least  minutes at this point    The mother rushes up to my manager  snatches Kevin out of her hands  and scolds her for holding her child   No apology or sign of remorse for leaving her child   It turns out that the family got all the way to the other end of the mall before realizing that their child was missing   At that point  the off duty officer informed the mother that if he was on duty he would have charged her  but he was not  so he left the store after telling them off   The situation was then handed over to mall security after that so I do not know what happened to the family after that   Sadly I assume they were let go with a warning by mall security because the police never showed up to question us   I cant believe that they left their baby  full home alone style  and had the audacity to lecture scold us for their negligence,2484,484
467,jyzck7,1,2,First day on the till and I got shouted at Sorry this is long  This happened around a year ago while working in a reasonably high end retail shop in the UK  I worked on a makeup counter as the manager  each counter had its own ‘island’ and ours was L shaped  A little further away from our counter  facing the shorter side of our L shape counter that we never use unless we have a makeover in  they sold nail polish  random things  and they had a till area for that  It wasn’t really close to us  So before I start  I had been here for  weeks  The store had a dumb policy that they don’t till train you until the third week so you’re not “overwhelmed ” even though I had worked in retail before  This was my first day I finally had a till number and was getting used to it  We only really sold items from our counters  One day I was doing our weekly paperwork that took hours and I was focused  I suddenly felt eyes on me and I looked up  and turned to the side of me and there’s a woman standing there angrily shaking some nail polish at me with her eyebrows raised  First of all Karen why are you stood in a makeover area where you’re hidden by mirrors and there’s no till  I told her to come around to where my till actually was  I was a little slow on the till  I’ll admit  But I was polite  I ask her if she has a store card  she slams it on the counter without speaking a word  Oooook Me  “ok and the total is £”She slams another card on the counter without a word again and I assume it’s a gift card  because you know  I just gave her the total  In the store you have to know how much is on the gift card for the till to accept it Me  “oh do you know how much is on here  It’s just we have to know before I can put it on the till” Her  “I think you’ll find that’s a STAFF DISCOUNT card ” In the rudest tone Me  “oh ok  sorry it’s my first day on the till  I’m not sure how to do that yet I’ll get someone to help”She’s glaring at me by this point  One of the assistant department managers was talking to another counter near me so I get her and she does it quickly for me and walks away again Me  “ok and then your new total is  gives total ” no response again  just glaring  I was getting pretty tired of her attitude so I just went silent assuming she wasn’t in the mood  Neither was I  I’d been doing non stop paperwork  I handed her the receipt and she walks awayI thought that would be the end of it  But nope  All of a sudden she turns back around and aggressively says  “you know what  Some MANNERS wouldn’t go amiss  a please or a thank you maybe instead of being RUDE ”Like no I’d been working for six days straight and was at the start of my  hour shift and I’d had enough alreadyMe  “    why would I thank you when I’m the one serving you “ before I could finishHer  “I’m going to speak to your manager ” And stomps over to the assistant department manager  Jokes on her because she’s not my manager After speaking to her she storms off out the store  the assistant DM tells me all she said was I need to learn manners and how to use a till  duh   and she didn’t believe a word of it anyway and told me to ignore customers like that  because it’s higher end they can apparently be a nightmare,3250,631
468,jyylkr,1,45,Nobody puts baby in the corner  Had a customer come in with some balloons  but no receipt  I informed him that without the receipt  wed have to charge him for inflation because we have no proof of purchase  He got mad and asked for the manager  When we get angry customers we usually have them stand off to the side to wait for management so I said   Go ahead and wait over in that corner by the piñatas   Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because he said   NO  Im going to wait RIGHT HERE   And I was just like okay       you do you man  Then when my manager came over he was like   She told me that you needed the receipt and I have to go stand in the corner  Dude   thats not what I meant and you know it  He was acting like I was treating him like a kindergartner in trouble,797,151
469,jyyemp,1,2,So you want to electrocute your customers dogs  I spent  years working in retail  The first  of these I spent working in the petcare sector  Its been about  years since then  so my memories and stories of this time are a little fuzzy  but there is one story that really sticks in my mind  and this is the story I now share with you all today  This story takes place at some point between  and   when I worked at a large pet superstore here in the UK  TLDR at end   On this particular day  I was working close to the front of the store  and a customer approached me  As I say  memories are fuzzy  so I will be paraphrasing here  but this is roughly how the conversation went   Customer  Hello  i was wondering if you sold those electric shock collars that stop dogs barking   Me  Im afraid those are illegal here in the UK sir due to animal cruelty laws  We have other  more humane options available though  such as collars that blast air or water if the dog barks  or ones that make noises   Customer  I see  I really need a lot of them though   Me  You have a lot of dogs that all need anti bark training   Customer  Well  I just opened a kennels in the country  and my closest neighbour half a mile down the road is complaining that the dogs are too loud   Me  So you were wanting to put electric shock collars on your customers dogs    Customer  Well I need to shut them up somehow   Me  Im not sure we have anything that would be suitable for that  Those dogs are in an unfamiliar environment  with their owners absent  surrounded by other stressed  barking dogs  Im not sure youre going to have much success getting them to be quieter    Him  Ok  thankyou  And with that  he left  leaving me perplexed  confused  and pretty angry that someone would thing its a good idea to put electric shock collars  illegal or not  onto dogs that were not their own  Thinking back  I should probably have tried to find out where this kennels was and perhaps reported them or something  but in the heat of the moment  and in the shock of what he said  I didnt really think about it at the time   TL DR   Guy opened a kennels in the countryside  and neighbours complained about the noise  so he wanted to put electric shock collars on his customers dogs to stop them barking,2315,436
470,jyrjmf,1,41,The customers not always right  I work at a pretty well known home improvement store and today  I was giving one of my coworkers her break from our garden center  Its usually pretty slow out there  so I have a lot of time to talk to customers and interact with them between transactions  This lady and her husband came up to me and asked about the marigolds we had on special  I believe it was  quart size pots for   or something around there   I pointed them out to her and she and her husband disappeared for a few minutes  Eventually  they came back and grabbed  of the gallon size pots and plopped them down on the register  I started scanning their items like normal and when I got to the marigolds  they rang up as    each  I informed her of this and she wasnt the slightest bit happy  My register even said they were the gallon size  which I told her and they werent the ones on special  and she tried to tell me I didnt know a quart from a gallon and I needed to tell someone to fix the advertisement sign  I wasnt about to start an argument with her  but I remembered the conversion of  quarts in a gallon and I wanted to tell her that and  kindly  of course  point out that there was no way in heck that  of the bigger pots could ever fit into  of the smaller ones  I finally got her the ones that were on special  but she was so mad at me  Another customer trying to haggle for a lower price averted,1427,278
471,jyq504,1,34,Hung up on rude customer today Definitely something Ive wanted to do several times before  but I really couldnt justify it until this particular call  The lady was speaking loudly  presumably very close to the mic  in a way that made every other word unintelligible  I eventually told her this and she tells me that it sounds like Im whispering  Thats possible  Im pretty soft spoken and the face coverings dont help I at least tried to speak up and make it easier for her to understand me  She made no similar effort  After that it was just personal attacks against me   Oh  youre just saying you understand me because you dont know what product Im describing   I didnt know what product she was describing  Theres thousands of items in the store  its very unlikely that I would  I was in the process of searching our database for something like it  I told her this  She continued to make disparaging remarks while I searched  If only she could comprehend how significantly her comments impaired my focus   Eventually  it became clear she had no more interest in what she originally called about  and the conversation was now just a means of satisfying her ego by belittling the inferior retail employee  When I heard her husband start swearing at me in the background  I hung up  It felt good  I usually bend over backwards  more than I should  for customers  but honestly  if you arent adult enough to resist petty personal insults and just be pleasant  I have no interest in helping you  Im sure my managers would back me up on this  Now  Im sure this story is pretty mild compared to what some have experienced  Some jobs I would imagine it happens quite often,1687,294
472,jyn1dt,1,1,Customers saying “I get it for cheaper somewhere else”  How do you deal with them  So I get these types of customers on a daily basis where they typically come in and ask about pricing  So a  year old guy comes in with his gf or something  and asks “do you guys sell any cigars”  I said “yes” and proceeded to recommend to him some brands where he blatantly ignored me  He then asked me “how much do you sell X cigar for “ Let’s call X a cigar brand   I proceeded to tell him    which was followed by him saying I get them for   from somewhere else  These type of people make me wanna go over the counter and just straight up smack em  I kept my cool and told him “we sell them based on how much we get them from our wholesaler”  Didn’t even say thank you  he turns around and just leaves  How do you deal with these types of customers,842,167
473,jyj6qw,1,13,Lady wants money back in something we never sold her I used to work in a small local department store in a rural town  We were not a chain  and literally had  people working there I’m working at the register and this older lady comes in a demands a refund on a dressing gown she bought for her husband I check for a price sticker and ask her for a receipt  No she must have thrown it out At this point I realise we don’t even stock this product so I have no idea where she bought it from but it was definitely not our store  I try explaining that    We don’t stock this product     We have never stocked this product  I even try to find an invoice for us ever buying it    The tag on the item is not even from our store    Even if it was  she doesn’t have a receipt so there is nothing I can do She starts getting frustrated and belittling me saying  well you obviously can’t do anything  you’re completely useless Ah yes  I apologise for my own sheer incompetence in not being able to give you money back for something we never sold you  She says she will never be back and we have lost a loyal customer of  years I mean  I’ve never seen her in the store before in my  years there so not a huge loss,1224,238
474,jyisat,1,13,I Got To Give A Free Bear  Im typing this on my break  because oh my word  it made my day  This is my second day in a seasonal job  and Im pretty sure it will be the best day on the job My store has a big scratch and win promotion going on  Every ticket wins and ranges from discounts to free items to a grand prize of a   shopping spree  One of these prizes is a like three foot bear  All day its been   offs  a few   cards  one free thing  whatever  Then  at the til on my watch  a middle aged couple scratches to win the giant bear    I was stoked  I was super happy  my client just got the bear  I happily pulled him off the shelf to give to the family  This couple said they felt bad about taking it  and instead they asked us to donate it  Maybe give it to a family that looked in need or had a lot of kids  We were touched by their generosity  My coworker and I almost cried  After an hour  we got a call from our boss who wanted to check in with us  We finally asked if we could donate the bear  and she said we could give it to someone  My coworker said that I could pick the family because it was my client who pulled the bear card  Not long after that  a young  looking couple walked by  One parent holding a sleeping toddler in his arms  I imagined this kid with the bear and my heart melted  I told my coworker I think I found the kid  She said go for it  not to ask her  The family was pretty close to the exit  so I booked it  caught up with them  and said  Excuse me  Excuse me  Hi  would you like a free teddy bear   The family was shocked  but said sure  As we walked back to the store  I explained what happened  They were shocked to see how big the bear was  but they looked really happy to be receiving this gift for their kid  Now Im on break and cant stop smiling  and I guarantee my mother will cry when I tell her this story when I get home,1887,382
475,jygmp3,1,109,No questions asked return policy     yikes My best friend and I were working customer service   returns one summer and a man walked in who had purchased a mattress topper  You know     like the foamy thing that goes over the top of the mattress  The bag had been ripped opened and you could visibly see hair on the thing so we knew it had been used  We had a no questions asked return or exchange policy as long as the item was returned with a receipt  The policy states an employee must open the package and inspect it to see if it can hit the shelves again or if it should be disposed of  and by disposed of it meant it would go to auction   clearance or donated to charity  I was the unfortunate one to have to open this bag  Upon pulling out the foamy the guy turned around as to not make eye contact with us while inspecting it  There were bed bugs crawling out the centre  a large amount of what smelled like ammonia possibly cat urine and fecal matter  I called my manager and explained what just happened and in minutes she was there to rush the refund through  I was pulled into the office and fired for discriminating against the stores return policy  I wasn’t trying to argue  I thought it was disgusting that people would even try get their money back and return something in that condition  So this is why I stopped shopping there and to this day i cringe and get itchy when I think of the fact that they just threw it into a donation bin and didn’t burn it,1477,280
476,jxt242,1,10,Dude  just because youre hot doesnt mean Ill bend the rules for you   Hello dere  This happened at my retail job two years ago  It started on a Charmin Basic weekday afternoon at the women’s clothing store I worked in and I was in a good mood  I didn’t cuss out my alarm clock  the weather was nice  promos were bringing in good business  and I was working with two of my favorite ladies  While processing shipment  I hear my coworker talking with someone at the register  She shortly after came up to me with a confused and pretty flustered look on her face  She was still in training as she only recently got this job at the time and going about a return without a receipt was one of the things she had yet to learn  No biggie  I was happy to handle it for her while she watched and learned  The manager was busy on a phone call and I had no problem stepping up when I could When I saw the man  likely early to mid forties  I understand why she was so flustered  This man  oh muh GAWD  GIRL  compliments to the chef  was gorgeous  Clean shaved  great skin  nicely pressed suit  news reporter white teeth  The textbook definition of tall  dark and handsome  The kind of man you don’t bring home to mama because she’d keep him for herself  My coworker stood by while I greeted the very pretty man with my usual retail smile  professional enough not to be intimidated by good looks Me  “Hello  sir  How can I help you ” Pretty Man    giving me a softcore Finn smolder   “Hello  lovely lady  How are you today ” Me    flattered but not fazed   “Doin’ good  thank you  Coworker tells me you have some returns ” Pretty Man  “I’m afraid so  I bought these for my mom a month ago  She shops here a lot  and everything I picked out she either didn’t like or didn’t fit  So  I’d like to return them and have the money refunded on my card please ” Me  “Alrighty  Do you have the receipt ” Pretty Man    sucks air through his teeth   About that…Me  “Ah okay  We can look up the purchase history if your mom is part of our free rewards program  Do you know her phone number ” Pretty Man  “   Do I need to do all that ” Me  “Yes  sir  It’s store policy ”He tells me his mom’s number  I type it in  and nothing comes up  He tries three other numbers that don’t work  I ask for her first and last name  email address  HOME address  husband’s name and number  HIS name and number  sometimes customers use family members’ names and numbers instead of their own for whatever reason   All of our regular customers were signed up for the rewards as they earn them through purchases and get coupons that were basically free money to use at the store Whenever the man looked to be getting impatient  he’d clear his throat and recompose himself whenever he saw me look at him  The whole time he’s feeding me empty flattery  asked where I got my hair done  I do it myself   compliments my makeup  asking how someone so young could be so professional  I was mid s at the time   just brown nosing me so much  he could take a crap by blowing his nose  The red flags waving in my head turned to red alarms with the unmistakable scent of bull crap radiating off him as he spoke  I don’t like people blowing smoke up my fabulous tush and this guy’s shotgun game was weak Me  “Sorry  sir  Nothing is working  Without a receipt or rewards account showing proof of purchase and date within the return window  we can’t take these items back ” Pretty Man    showing signs of irritation but acted civil ish   “It was a month ago  I used this card ” Me  “The policy stands  sir  I’m sorry  there’s nothing I can do ” Pretty Man    puts on the charm   “Honey  you are way too pretty to leave a man hanging  Is there really—”Me    stone faced   “My name isn’t ‘honey’  sir  There’s nothing more I can do for you  Please take your bag and have a good day ” Pretty Man  “Pleeeaase  you can’t make this work for me ” My manager comes from the back room  coming in hot behind the counter to me and boy  was she mad  She tells the man straight up  “Sir  my associate has explained everything to you  Please leave ” Pretty Man    taken aback and stammers a bit   “Uh  um  I was telling her—” Manager  “I heard what you told her  including your weak game trying to get a date with a woman half your age  I have security on speed dial  Don’t tempt me ” With that  the wide eyed man grabbed his bag of clothes and left  I suspected the guy was trying to return stolen merch for cash  and my manager confirmed it my suspicion correct  Turns out a couple days ago  she received a call from one of our sister stores who ALSO received a call from another sister store of someone matching Pretty Man’s description  in the exact same suit no less  trying to return clearly stolen merch and played the same prince charming act to other employees to sweet talk them into going against policy  There were maybe five of our stores within a sixty mile radius of each other and Pretty Man WENT TO THREE OF THEM  that we knew of  with his schtick We’ve had customers try to return stolen merch before and they usually blew their stacks when we caught onto their scheme  but not Pretty Man  No no no  he tried to catch more flies with honey instead of vinegar  thinking if he looked like a Men’s Warehouse model and used sweet words to get the ladies salivating  he would get some free money  Clever scheme  I admit  but poorly executed as it didn’t work at any of our stores  I grew up with low self confidence and never believed when anyone complimented my appearance unless they wanted something  so it was easy to tap back into my “Nice try  dafuh you want ” mentality Moral of my story  Use your head  Some of the most beautiful people have the ugliest intentions,5768,1038

481,jweh6h,1,19,TO THE WINDOOOOOOOOW So  this happened a few months ago during the back to school shopping craze that happens every year  Im an assistant manager at a small shoe store in the trendiest outdoor mall where I live  The company I work for used to have a popular style called Shape Ups and Demi Lovato did a commercial for them years ago  This happened on a Sunday  It was just me and my two newest employees  One of my employees was working her second shift ever  this is her first job  Both of them are very sweet  quiet  and sometimes shy girls  We were relatively busy because back to school is our busiest time of year  There were about as many parents and kids in my store as we were safely allowed to let in this year when a rather energetic and enthusiastic lady in her mid thirties came up to the register wanting to use some rewards points  We inform her that we have no way in our current POS system to look up any of her account information like points and that she will need to pull up the coupon on her phone and bring it to us  Like most malls in the U S  our store is a black hole for reception  and I have to steal wifi from the Fossil next door just to do my job every day  We inform her that she can get better reception by the front door  by the windows It is at this time that I realize that I havent used the restroom in a while  so I excuse myself as the girls are explaining the reception to this customer  I came back a few short moments later and there were tears in their eyes and they were struggling not to laugh Apparently  this woman decided that just walking to the window was not the course of action for her  Instead  she shouted  TO THE WINDOOOOW  TO THE WALL  TO THE SWEAT DRIPPING DOWN MY BALLS  ALL THEM BITCHES CRAWL  and the rest of the chorus while she walked up  In a room store full of children with their parents  no less  My employees said that conversation stopped for a moment because it was such a display  Thee customer bought like  pairs of shoes for     so I guess it all worked out  I had a few parents joke about it with me at the register about it  so I dont think too many people were offended  I just wish I had waited a few minutes to use the restroom so that I could have seen this glorious display,2271,437
482,jvzjhf,1,152,I want you to refund me  Its obvious you dont care about me OR my situation  My day started with this woman So I work front desk admin for a window blind install company  Most of my work is done on the computer and phone  but occasionally I get walk ins  First thing this morning  I return a call from a customer who left a voicemail  well call her Karen as usual  Karen placed an order with our sales representative last week on the th  and Ive been trying to get a hold of her ever since to get her on the schedule for an install after her items arrive  Its the holidays  the big  C  affecting our country  and our warehouse in CA  so shipping is a bit slower than usual   I tell her that we can do the install on January th or th since the items will leave the warehouse on December th I got a voicemail from her this morning  and she said the th or th is fine  Now  this is where I think the misunderstanding was  I call her back  and I state again the th or th  and here is our exchange   Karen   Well why is it taking so long      Me   I assume its the materials shortage our warehouse for these items is in California  maybe the spike in   C  cases pushed things out     Karen   That was ONLY A WEEK AGO  Honestly  this is false advertising and youre lying to people     Me   Maam we dont set the dates  we just do the order and install  They are all estimated as it is  it could be       Karen   Well you need to tell the manufacturer that they are falsely advertising   I want you to do that for me    I go quiet for a second  and I wont lie  I lay my head down on my desk and sigh   Me   Okay  I can do that  but the shipping       Karen   UGH OBVIOUSLY YOU DONT CARE  You wont get anything done for me  just cancel my order  I want a refund      Me   Okay I can do that maam  I just need to speak to our representative first to cancel the order      Karen   Well its clear YOU dont care about my situation   and I know you wont get this done  so I need your full name and number     Me   I do care  I will actually be the one refunding you once the order is canceled  I just need to verify the cancelation with our representative and the manufacturer first    She gets kind of quiet after that  I tell her my info and she hangs up I wont lie  I got a bit short with her after her telling me what I dont care about  Almost every single customer is on slow ordering now and I do my absolute best to keep them updated  Also  Ive called her and emailed her a total of  times trying to get the info to her  but I guess I dont get anything done Also  again our warehouse is in CA  Theres the  C   the wildfires  a materials shortage  Plus the holidays are coming up and the warehouse closes the entire week of Thanksgiving  Christmas  and New Years  Also  if she didnt keep talking over me  I would have loved to tell her  its just an estimated date   percent of the time the products show up much earlier  She would probably have had her items by mid December and if that was the case I could easily reschedule her to an earlier date  I honestly think she thought I said December th or th over the phone originally  and instead of saying it was a misunderstanding she just flew off the handle  To top it off  the representative told her it would take about  weeks for the order to move out  so thats not very far off from the date the manufacturer predicted the items will leave the warehouse  the th of December  The lady is not taking the holidays into account But shell get her Karma I guess  I told our representative everything  and hes going to talk to her  but since she took almost a week to respond to me  shes not getting her deposit back UPDATE  Coworker tried to smooth things over with her  She was nasty to him too  Wont be getting a refund but she canceled anyway    down the drain for her   So new blinds for me  I feel bad for my coworker though  but at least he wont get money taken from his sale,4011,742
483,jvkt9s,1,355,“it’s ridiculous that you can’t give me the refund because I don’t have the same card”  Had a customer come in yesterday for a refund on a   blind  She had her receipt  it was all within the  day time frame  everything was fine until I asked if she had the same card she purchased it with  She asked which one it was and I told her the last three digits of her card shown on the receipt  She tried to look for it and couldn’t find a card ending in those last three digits  I asked if she had used her phone at the time of the purchase as the last  digits tend to change on the receipt sometimes  she said no  She was beginning to get agitated  I asked if someone else had made the purchase and she said she was here with her husband when he made the purchase  I said to her that it was most likely her husbands card then to which she responded aggressively  “NO  my husband and I share the same cards”  At this point it’s going nowhere and I explained to her calmly that any refund made has to go back on the same card the item was purchased with  She said that she’s made refunds at this store before and no one asked her if she had the same card  Obviously she was lying because every employee at our store asks the customers if they have the same card the purchase was made on  I explain to her calmly  “I understand but I’m afraid they should’ve asked you as it is the policy”  She of course asked for the manager  I page my manager and explain to him the situation  My manager said the same thing that it has to go back on the same card or it can go on a store gift card  She started throwing a fit and snatched the receipt off me  She walked out angrily saying  “how ridiculous it is that we can’t give her her refund”  I’m sorry but don’t most retail stores ask customers if they have the same card they made the purchase on when refunding items Edit  the refund has to go back according to the method of purchase  If she had paid with cash  it’ll say it on the receipt and we’d be able to give her back the refund  It was paid through card  it has to go back on the same card the purchase was made on,2117,419
484,jv37q0,1,4,Where did the homeless lady go  Preface  If you’re triggered by medical emergencies or possible death  this story may not be for you  So I work at a pretty big retail store in my state that has many subsidiaries around the U S   which isn’t important to the story  I just included it for some background information   So ever since I started my job in early August  I noticed that there was always this homeless lady that roamed the store going from asile to asile day after day  She would be at the store just about every day  from open to close  Even when I went there on my days off to shop  I don’t know what her particular situation was in regards to her mental state but she would sometimes make really weird and random sounds in the aisles and it kind of freaked out the costumers from time to time  I am in no way meaning to make fun of her if she does have some type of mental illnesses or disability  Just stating what I noticed while working there  but we never asked her to leave since she was usually pretty quiet and we didn’t bother wasting the time or money calling the police or anyone else  but what we did notice  is that she had some source of income because she somehow had a smartphone and always had money to buy food or other items in the store  Anyways  managers at my store are usually pretty persistent on telling us associates to wear out ears  walkie talkie and earpiece  while working around the store since sometimes it’s easier to use a walkie than to page every individual associate over the PA  anyways  one day I was in the “employee only” area at my job since mostly all that needed to be done in my department had been done for the day  and the walkie on my hip stared to go crazy with things about “ambulance en route” “self check out A” and “homeless lady… medical assistance”  I immediately bee lined it for the self check out late mentioned over the walkie  which was now closed for obvious reasons  and saw  to my disbelief  the homeless lady on the ground  on her hands and knees  with the paramedics next to her trying to calm her down and  what looked like  them telling her to breathe deeply  About  minutes later the whole ordeal was over with and completely forgotten about until recently  I noticed that I haven’t seen her since that whole incident happened at the store  at this point a couple months ago   At this point I can only hope that the found help other than the grim reality that she could have been hospitalized or even died  I just pray that she found help and is  hopefully  still alive,2554,468
485,juzk53,1,48,Fellow cashier catches her alcoholic step dad trying to buy alcohol while drunk So for context  I work in a state that doesn’t allow you to sell alcohol if you’re under   This story happened about a year ago  I was working an evening shift and this very clearly intoxicated man comes to my register with a case of beer  I could smell him from the end of my conveyer belt  He gets to the front and asks for cigarettes  so I direct him to the only register that can sell cigarettes  The cashier on that register is under  also so I notify a manager that the cashier will need assistance soon for an alcohol sale  I also mention that the man is clearly intoxicated and  therefore  cannot purchase the alcohol  not sure if it’s the law or just store policy   He finally gets to the front of the line again and the cashier rings up everything but the alcohol  The manager goes to the register and informs the man that he cannot buy the alcohol because he’s clearly intoxicated  He argues that he walked there and should be allowed to purchase it because he isn’t driving  This confuses my manager and leads to  or  higher up managers coming to the front to try to sort it out  This is when I hear the cashier behind me screaming something I can’t remember exactly but it was something along the lines of “that’s my step dad  he’s an alcoholic” and “I’m calling my mom ” The cashier runs over and begins yelling in her step dad’s face while calling her mom  When her mom answers  the cashier tells her what’s going on and the mom starts yelling at him too  Long story short  he didn’t get his alcohol but he might’ve gotten a divorce  Not the craziest story  but definitely an eventful scenario to watch unfold,1711,317

488,juh1w3,1,109,Old guy yells at me while I help his wife pick out a vibrator  So  if the title and my post history isn’t self explanatory I work in a sex store  The stories I could tell just from my year here could fill a book  particularly because I work in a rather “methy” small town in Canada  I also work late shifts most nights so  it gets Interesting Anyways tonight I had  fine glossy eyed specimen enter my store and popped up a few retail red flags immediately  so I kept an eye out but offered my assistance and didn’t bother them while they looked around  For some context  everything in my store is under a magnet lock so I’ll have to come unlock whatever product they are looking for  They asked me to come grab a few items off the wall and put them behind the counter while they continued to look As I head back to the counter I hear a tell tale cardboard rip and see that the lady had ripped something off the hook and was examining it   While swaying drunkenly mind you  I walked over and gently asked for it back from her so I could tape the product back up since the box was all mangled now and she didn’t want it  As I’m turning around to do this she rips off another one  I turn around and gently say “hey could you just be careful not to rip the merchandise off  I can grab anything if you want to look at it ”She apologized immediately and slurred that she was just trying to see the back  I told her it was not an issue and took both items back behind the counter As I did this  Drunk hubby walks up to the counter and raises his voice at me as his wife continues to look around Side note  I’m incredibly kind and cheery  not in a condescending way  that’s just naturally how I am and I use it to de escalate situations so I’m being genuinely kind and helpful to this man during all thisDrunk  D Wife  W  Me  M D  We’re not spending anymore fucking money here  We would but we don’t wanna buy anything else from you ” M  “because I asked her to be careful with the products ”D  “ LIKE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE   I’m coming back tomorrow to speak to your boss” Me  “okay for sure feel free   I’m just doing my job making sure stuff doesn’t get damaged  Anything else I can help you with though ” my boss will honestly probably tell the guy to fuck off D  “NO  We’re leaving  “W   looks intently at the wall of vibrators  “wait hold on I like this one”D  “babe were fucking LEAVING  NOW”W  looking at  different vibrators  wait D   practically screaming at this point  NO  NOW M  “can I help you choose any of those ”D  “I SAID WERE FUCKING GOING NOW”W  “One more minute  Does this one recharge  Me  “No  not that one  But I do have this one that’s   off and is rechargeable   ” W  “and waterproof  “M  “absolutely  “W  “yeah I’ll take that  “So he stands with his arms crossed and brows furrowed while I grab the products for them and then he has to fork over   for all the stuff they grabbed  I happily bagged it all and asked all the basic questions  followed up by my best wishes for a lovely evening  And smiled because I make commission and he didn’t say another word as he left  I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing if he tries to contact my boss tomorrow Oh and I took down his license plate and gave  a lil tip there’s a possible drunk guy in a big truck who just left the sex shop    I’m still at work writing this so sorry for any errors I’m the flow of the story,3451,650
489,juf2iu,1,77,Guy isn’t allowed to buy alcohol and throws a fit So  for context  I work in a large grocery everything store and in the state I’m in  I can’t sell alcohol because I’m under   This story happened a few days ago and I was working with my favorite manager  A guy comes to my register with beer  wine  a couple other items and his  year old girlfriend  I scan everything but the alcohol and go get my manager for the rest  As per store policy  she asked for both the guy and his girlfriend’s IDs  The girl admits she’s not  so my manager refuses the sale  The guy threw an absolute fit and started screaming about how stupid it was that he couldn’t buy the alcohol because “she’s in a separate car ” He proceeds to tell both me and my manager that he’s just going to come back in without her and buy it  to which my manager replies “I’ll make sure you don’t ” He continues his fit  and even rams his cart into my register  His poor girlfriend was so nice and apologized for his behavior on their way out  About five minutes later  I’m on my break and buying a quick snack at the self checkout where I see none other than the big baby trying to buy his alcohol  I’m going to be petty  Just as the girl on self check goes to approve it  I call her over to tell her what happened before  Unfortunately  she approved the sale before coming over to me  I quickly explain and she rushes over and pulls his card out of the machine and takes the alcohol from him while telling him he can’t buy it  He acts dumb and pretends he doesn’t know what’s going on and I look him dead in the eyes and say “don’t act stupid  you know why ” He DEMANDS a manager and  too bad for this guy  all the other managers except for the one who had told him no earlier were in a meeting  Of course he is enraged and begins screaming and yelling again about how stupid this whole situation is  I agree   I didn’t get to see the end result as I really just wanted to take my break  The best part is that if he hadn’t been so rude and acted like a complete idiot  I would’ve just acted like I didn’t see anything and he would’ve gotten his beer and wine,2125,414
490,jtzqco,1,30,Not what I expected So yesterday I was acting as manager on duty and was striking through the store making sure everything was fine when I see a middle aged couple gesturing towards me to get my attention  My first thought was  how rude     And went to see what the issue was  Then they started to  ask  for a shoe size pointing to the size marked on the box and then I thought they might be tourist who didnt speak the language  No problem  I just started to speak slowly and clearly and throw some english in case they spoke english when then I notice they didnt have an accent when they tried to speak  it was more of a growl  and they spoke between them in sign language  Thats when it clicked  they were deaf and couldnt hear a thing I said  and couldnt read my lips  Well  I did my best to assist them by going with them through every shoe looking for the size they wanted and calculating the final prize of shoes after promotions    Even gave them some of my personal thoughts on how specific shoes looked  All of that with basic gestures and mimic since I cant speak sing language  Although at the end I realized I could just take out my mobile checkout device and use the notepad app to write down some sentences  which helped a lot  At the end they left with a shoe they were buying for a present for a really nice price and they were extremely grateful for the help  This really made my day and made me realize that we usually remember and focus on those one in a hundred costumers who are rude and cause a scene  but dont pay attention to the vast majority of costumers who are kind and grateful,1620,305
491,jtqm4p,1,11,A positive tale from my retail days This was originally my comment on another thread  but I wanted to share this here as well  I think the family in this tale made all of the other retail stress worthwhile for me When I worked retail  there was a couple that brought in their special needs son every day because he loved our store  I don’t know why  but I felt a need to connect with him—maybe I just really wanted to be extra kind to him and his parent  Anyways  I spend a solid year just waving to him and saying hi  to which he would respond with a brisk wave and keep going One Halloween I found out he loved Blow pops so I started keeping them in my locker and offering him one  with his parents’ permission  when I would say hello  which he almost always accepted  He really started warming up to me after a few months of daily hellos and lollipops One day I was talking to his mom about an order she had placed and he walked up to us with his dad  I said my usual hello and offered him a lollipop  but this time was different That was the day he hugged me  A real  affectionate  joyful hug  I cried right then and there while I hugged him back  I looked at his mom  who also had tears in her eyes  and told her how special that moment was to me  I was so grateful for that little moment Over the next year or so we continued our daily greetings  sometimes with a hug but most of the time with just a hello and a thank you  I knew his family was  in the process of moving out of state  so I did my best to appreciate every moment while I still could On their last visit to the store  which I knew because they had told me what day they were leaving the state   I gave Noah the biggest bag of Blow pops I could find and told him how much I was going to miss him  He hugged me tight and didn’t let go  so I hugged him back for as long as he needed  When he finally let go  he looked me in the eyes and told me that he was really going to miss me too I cried as I said goodbye to him  then cried more as I said goodbye to his mom  I let her know how special Noah was to me and how grateful I was to her for trusting me around him  then I wished them safe travels and a happy life To this day I wish I had taken a picture with Noah to remember those little moments better  but I still think about him all the time  I truly hope he and his family are doing well,2379,475

493,jtidqx,1,16,We  wasted   minutes of this ladys time because the check machine wasnt working So this happened in   I think later  I dont remember exactly when this happened  It was about an hour left in my shift and of course I was ready to go home  I think this woman come up ready to check out and it started out like every other transaction  I said my usual greeting and she was nice   at first  I finished ringing up her items and told her her total  She decided her choice of method was check  yes we still take check  Now I would like to point out  as it says in the title  that the check machine on the register I was on wasnt working  I know this because I had this problem with my last customer literally before my break  Luckily the couple was very understanding and patient while we were trying to fix that Anyway  back to the story  The woman filled out the check and gave it to me and after filling out the necessary information on the check  just some drivers license info   I then started to put the check in the check machine and of course as expected it didnt run through  Now I admit I shouldve told this woman that the machine wasnt working  but for some reason I was thinking it would work this time  So I did what I did last time this happened  I called someone over my walkie to come to my register  Now I apologized to this woman for the inconvenience as one of my coworker came over to help me out  I told her how the machine wasnt working right and I was getting someone to help get it to work so we can get her receipt  someone from customer service   Now this is where things start to go downhill  The cast of this story is me  RL  rude lady  CW   coworker    CW   coworker   who doesnt really talk or interact in this story  but does play a minor role   and M  manager  who also has a minor role   The following conversation may not be   accurate due to this happening a while ago Me  I apologize maam  but the machine isnt working  It wasnt working earlier so I will get someone over here to help fix the issueRL  oh   well I dont have time for this  Cant I just go to another register to pay Now I would like to point out that the money that she paid was already in the system so if she went to another register  she wouldve been double charged and her total was almost at    But I didnt know that at the time Me  well   um   So RL went to CW s register to  check out  and I stood there dumbfounded and not knowing what to do  A few moments later  CW  walked up to my register and asked what the issue was  I told her what was going on and my eyes shifted to RL who was at CW s register  She followed my gaze and she walked up to her CW   maam  youre going to have to come back here and finish your transaction  Your check has already went through the system so youre going to be charged again if you continue checking out with her  CW   RL looks at us before walking back over  Now I would like to say  I didnt really say anything for this next part  and as I said in another story  Im nonconfrontational so in a way I felt like I was being protected a little in some way from feeling RLs anger and frustration by myself RL  I dont have time for this  Im in a rush  Ive been here trying to check out for  minutes  it was more like   minutes   I need to pick up my kids CW   I understand maam  but we were having problems with the machine earlier so well try to figure this out  RL  well then I shouldve paid in cash shouldnt I  CW   Maam  let me fin RL  no  Hush and let me finish  Im in a rush  Ive been here for  minutes now  I need my receipt So after a few back and forth  CW  eventually called M over the walkie  She said she would try to find her transaction and try to get this sorted out I dont remember how  but we eventually got her receipt  I apologized to RL and she kind of ignored both of us and looked at CW   who was kind of watching this interaction happen  and thanked her for her help and left  At that point  CW  told me to go to a different register for the rest of my shift since the check machine wasnt working At that point there were  minutes left in my shift and I was just ready to go home  I soon then talked to CW  about the incident since I was just done with my shift at that point I just hope wherever that lady had to be in order to talk to us like we were incompetent  she got there on time,4462,859

495,jtajy1,1,0,Im clearly not a retail person  Several years ago I had just graduated with my degree  finally   and was desperately trying to find work  I ended up working at a local chain store  which is one of the only places in my small town to shop  It wasnt ideal  but I was  years old  finally finished with my education  and unable to immediately find something in my field  I wasnt stoked about working with the public again  what can you do  When you have to work youll take anything I spent a couple of days training  and then on my first full day they threw me on the main register  It was a Sunday which is one of the busiest shopping days  and I was a wreck  I have really bad anxiety  and situations like this just get me all kinds of worked up  It was going fairly okay  but you all know how it is  New job jitters and whatnot Anyway  a lady whips out a check to pay with and just throws it at me  Like she literally took this check and just tossed it onto the conveyor belt  Now my previous experience in working with the public was in a small country store and then in food service  so I never really had to deal with this  My naïve ass wrote the amount on the check  put it into the machine  which accepted it  and then she went on her way  It did not occur to me see if she had signed the check Long story short she hadnt signed it  and I got called into the office  It was for something like    and if your drawer ever came up   short you were let go  My boss was someone that I knew  and she also knew the woman in question  She was a regular shopper  and they just couldnt believe she hadnt signed the check  My boss managed to get hold of the womens husband via the information on their check though  and explained the situation  He came down and signed it  so the bank would then take it  and apologized for the way his wife had behaved by just throwing a check down and walking out like that was perfectly okay  I thought it was great that he was so nice  and I was glad to still have my job Fast forward a couple of weeks  Im in the groove now and working primarily evenings  which I prefer  Its a pretty quiet night and Im the only one on register while the manager is stocking and straightening and all  This is typical for a week night in our town  but when people do come in they sort of flock all at once as was the case  I got a few checked out  and then a guy comes up wanting a cell phone  Theyre kept in a locked case on an end cap away from the register  and I notice the lady behind him just has a couple of small items and seems sort of flustered  I tell him I will be glad to grab that for him  but that Ill check her out quickly first and then he can show me which phone he wants etc The lady happily puts her items down and I scan them and bag them  and shes literally already about to pay when he  Goes  Ballistic He starts yelling about how he was there first  and I cant just let her  cut in front of him   Ive already hit the button for the manager to come up  when he throws out this line  I came in and signed a check for my wife  I saved one of YOUR peoples jobs  You cant treat me like this IT IS THE HUSBAND  Like I had no idea  I wasnt there when he came in to sign the check  and he has NO idea that the person she had tried to stiff was me So this guy is berating me still as I wait for the manager to come  and the other customer LIGHTS INTO HIM  She turns around and gives this guy an earful about how a manager has to unlock the phones  they didnt  but she didnt know that and bless her heart she was trying to help  and he shouldnt be so rude and nasty over something so simple and how I was just trying to make everyones night a little easier As this is all going on the manager finally appears  as do several other customers to check out  She gets yelling guy to another register  where hes still complaining  The lady then tells my manager that the guy was being a jerk and that I was just being helpful  which makes him MORE mad  She did get him the phone he wanted  but he was still acting like the greatest of injustices had been bestowed upon him Maybe I was wrong for letting her get her stuff and go  but at the time it just felt like the right thing to do  It was the only register  and since what he wanted required me to have to leave it I thought it best to get the only other customer at the time out of the way before I did so  I dont know  but wrong or not it just felt like he had just been waiting to throw out that  I saved one of your jobs  line to make himself feel superior  Well  buddy  you wouldnt have had to do that if your wife wasnt a crappy person After seeing his fit though  I could understand why theyre made for each other  They are also a big reason why I quit that job as soon as possible and moved on with my life  Retail is not for me,4872,962

505,jrghr9,1,50,Broken return policy  I worked at a major department store almost  years ago   ish  I was stationed in the juniors department  And a sweet little old lady  about   came up to my register with a return  I of course went to start the process  Should be simple Now I’d been working there for more than a year at this point  and pretty much knew the items that we had carried during that time The lady put  bags of returns on the counter   And proceeded to mention that she didn’t have the receipts any more    That shouldn’t be a problem I tell her  as store policy says she doesn’t need one   But that without the receipt  she’ll only get back the lowest price it has sold for  She said that was fine And as I peek into the bag to begin  I see clothes I’m absolutely sure we don’t sell  But  they still have tags attached so I suspiciously scan one  Nothing comes up   I scan something else  Still nothing    I mention to her I’m having trouble scanning the items  And that I’d need to call over my supervisor   while on the call I mentioned quietly that I’d never seen any of the clothes she was trying to return  The sweet lady was so patient  And chit chatted while we waited  My supervisor came over  and looked in the bag  She just stood there staring  She looked up at the old lady  And said “ um ma’am  when did you purchase these items ”The lady replied that she had found the bags when she was cleaning out her closet  She thinks it might have been from   Which explained why I couldn’t scan  The register only had info for last  years   She called down the store manager and they honored the return  They tried to approximate what she should be getting back  She left about  minutes later  Quite happy  To this day the return policy hasn’t changed  You can return something you bought nearly  years ago  with little to no problems  Ridiculous TLDR Lady brings in nearly  years old clothes as a return  Without a receipt  Store policy allows it  Lady’s only issue was how long it took for them to process the return,2062,374

517,jq29ex,1,13,Customer blames my employees for stealing something off his car that it was never equipped with in the first place  So I work as the Service Manager at a local car dealer  Basically I am over the entire service department   so most of my day is just dealing with complaints  But I had a new one yesterday   and that’s saying something  So a customer comes in for just an oil change  This particular customer had never serviced any vehicles with us before  As soon as he checks out he walks out to his car and pops his hood and “notices” that his engine cover is missing  why would you go out and just happen to pop the hood open if you didn’t already know it was missing   and proceeds to lose his ever loving mind  Of course  I get involved  He claims that he just checked his oil yesterday and the cover was there but now it’s not  I walk back to my technician’s work area to check and see if maybe he took it off and just forgot to put it back on  which can happen sometimes  In this case  there would be no reason to remove it  because it’s not required to do an oil change  but I figured I should at least cover all my bases  I check around his work area  his tool box  etc  and there is of course no cover  I asked him if he noticed it  and he tells me that there was no cover on it when he opened the hood  So I basically tell Mr  Customer  “I checked my technician’s work area  and spoke with him as well  It was not on the engine when he opened the hood ” He continues to lose his mind and accuse my technician of stealing the cover  I looked him dead in the eye and said  “sir  I’m pretty positive he didn’t take your engine cover to put on his  entirely different make and model of vehicle  ” I told him I wasn’t buying him a new cover  He proceeds to tell me that he’d be OK with a used one  another red flag   if you were convinced that we stole it  why would you be OK with a used one   and I told him  just to make him happy  that if I come across a used one  if we have a similar vehicle traded in  for example  I’ll see if I can snag one just to make him go away  Fast forward to this morning  Walking by the detail department  there is another exact year make model vehicle that had been traded in and they were cleaning up for the lot  I popped the hood and  no cover  Thinking there’s no way it’s a coincidence  I go to my parts department and ask them to price me out a new engine cover  I want the part number and price  Parts guy puts the VIN in and goes  “what engine cover  That vehicle never came with one ” So this a hole knew there was no cover  he probably bought it used  and there wasn’t one there   and he assumed there was supposed to be  and brought it to us for a cheap oil change because he thought he could just freak out and we’d cave and he’d get one for free  So now  I get to call him Monday to let him know that    He is not getting an engine cover  because they don’t exist for that vehicle  and   We will not EVER service any vehicle for him at any point in the future  He is fired as a customer Have a nice day  jackass,3080,608

524,jnb6fv,1,22,Grumpy old lady Used to work at a gas station years ago  Most items had a price on the shelf  but vendors could change the price and it would be updated in our computers  If nobody notices the price change shelf price wouldnt get changed One Sunday morning I was preparing to leave and my coworker had a a grumpy old lady comes in to buy some lotto tickets and her V and the price on the shelf for the V    or something but it rang up    more or     She doesnt realize until after she s paid  then starts ranting and raving about how thats fraud to have the shelf price incorrect and how we needed to fix the shelf prices and how wed overcharged her a dime  Total meltdown yelling  I step out of the office as my coworker is walking back to the cooler and rips the shelf price off of the shelf and comes back to the register  the old lady is still ranting about wanting her dime back  I can see my coworker reach into his pocket for a dime  but he doesnt have any change  I do  so I reach into mine  pull out a dime  and toss it on the counter  She throws the time back at me  grabs her V  and leaves the store still yelling  My coworker sees she left her lotto tickets on the counter  he picks them up and holds them up so she can see them through the front windows  she yells  Keep it  as she climbs in her car and drives off Literally left a   lotto ticket there over us charging her an extra dime we tried to give back to her  I wish I could say that lotto ticket was a big winner so we could have had a really good laugh at her expense  but unfortunately it was just another loser,1609,317

527,jmx0vd,1,129,Surely you just need the tags to return things    I havent heard this phrase throughout the  years of working in retail but trust me after hearing this phrase for the past  weeks now its driven me insane Customers come up to me with their returned items without the receipts and claim that they should surely be able to get away with that because the tags are still on the clothes items Im from the UK so I guess it might work differently  but I have never come across this  possibly seeing this sort of stuff in films and tv shows but thats it  IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOU MUST HAVE A RECEIPT WITHIN DATE WITH THE CORRECT CARD IF YOU PAID WITH CARD The tags dont do anything You see in order for me to process the returns  I need to scan a receipt  even if its been photographed  that receipt allows me to go through and select the items that need to be returned  they all have different kimball numbers etc   That way I am able to give the money back to the customers and finish the refund  If I scanned a tag it would probably not work or think that its a standard payment transaction   weeks ago I had to spend my final minutes of my shift  closing time too and also this went over my shift time  trying to explain to a lady that she needs the receipt and having the tags on the items does nothing  It was amazing to see how much denial and delusion she was in   But Im sure you used to return things with tags WE NEVER DID  If we did then it was probably  years ago  It doesnt mean we still carry the same philosophy today  Times have changed and Im certain that she is a frequent customer of the company I work for her so its unlikely she wouldnt have known this  Its incredible with what ideas customers come up with when it comes to returning things  Maybe if I just have the tags on the clothes theyll happily give me my money back Im curious  do any of you guys return things with just the tags and no form of receipt Enligten me here  like surely I cant be the only one who goes crazy over this,2046,383
528,jmr9kz,1,11,I dont think that means what you think it means   So one piece of background information  Cox Cable is a telecommunications company on the east coast of the US  This story takes place in their service area This particular story is  from when I worked for a particular well known tech support service  center attached to a Big box retail company with a propensity for blue  Every once in awhilea customer says or does something that just makes your day  I  walked up to the next client  to find that it was a husband and wife couple that had brought their computer in because they were having   with their internet  It became very evident very quickly that   wife was going to do the majority of the talking  She was one of  those people who can speak for  minutes to tell you her name  So among her long ramblings  I figure out they were having a problem with their internet and went to hook the system up to the test station to see  what I could see  While I was doing that the wife continued to explain how they had just upgraded their service package with their internet provider and that included such and such a speed and included this new router and just on and on and on  I kind of set my brain to listen to everything she said  but honestly  I was just filtering what she was saying She was going on about how much they were paying for their internet  and how much they and their kids use the internet and what they use it for  and when they signed up for the package  and they got this new router with that package but didnt get rid fo the old one and on and on and on    and then she said it  I should be able to click on the thing and bam  I have Cox in my face    Her husband responded sooner than I did with a snicker  It took me a moment to process it and when I did all I could do was a full lock down on my brain to prevent myself from saying something that would likely end badly,1912,372

530,jlxtch,1,24,When everything breaks and customers act like its somehow your fault and a personal insult to them  So this happened Friday afternoon starting about   pm and ending around   which isnt a super long time to have issues but it still wasnt great  I work at a hardware store as a cashier and on Friday I was by myself on the lumber end of the store at what are called the pro registers due to being located next to the pro desk and being frequented by contractors aka the pros  About   I noticed that there was some significant slowing down of the register processing card transactions  Weve recently gotten  new   in quotes because everything my store gets is refurbished and or hand me downs from other stores who were lucky enough to get brand new equipment  pin pads which while still buggy were significantly more usable than the old ones which had a bad tendency to only work perfectly for maybe   of the transactions  One of the big improvements  other than being fairly certain that no it really is the customers chip being broken and not a   toss up of the pin pad just not working to read chips again  was that theyre significantly faster at processing transactions  Also when searching for items on the Online Cashier Book  system thats supposed to list items from the store and have a function to search things from if they dont have a barcode but has the worst search functionality I have ever seen  aka the OCB  was running even slower than usual and giving me more connection errors than typical  Then the lone pro desk worker started having issues with his phone  In the middle of a call with a customer the line started breaking up so he tried to move the call to the other phone at the desk only for the phone to decide to reboot itself the second he lifted the receiver from the cradle  All else failing he ended up calling the guy back on his personal phone and kept dealing with weird issues with the phones for another thirty minutes  At three I get sent on my break and notice that the store wifi has gone from slow but mostly functional to completely unusable and now people are having issues with the time clock saying its not connected to the network when they try to clock in or out  Well this is going steadily downhill  Get back from break and continue checking out the sparse customers  Now customers who try to pay with a card are getting declined  First guy ran his card a second time and it went through but the next couple of people to try couldnt get it to work at all so I sent them to self check out in the hopes it was just my register having weird issues  Next thing I do is try to call my head cashier to see if theyre having issues on his end of the store  Oh would you look at that the phones are now completely down and nobody can contact each other anywhere in the store  And now a customer is trying to call the non functional phones which rerouted the call to the overhead PA system and its endlessly ringing  Yay So as Im sending customers down to the other end of the store saying my register isnt working Im trying to get a hold of anybody to see if they can tell me whats going on so I text my supervisors personal phone hoping he sees it quickly  Again no luck and it takes fifteen plus minutes and several more customers before I finally hear back from somebody over the walkie talkies we use for our lot loaders and they inform me that yeah all phones are down which took down the internet  or the other way around possibly  All I know is one going down took out the other  which then took out our ability to process card transactions  Theyre now trying to inform an assistant manager  again no in store phones are working so cant call him directly and nobody is sure where he was at first  to see if he could figure out what was going on  So then I get the joy of informing customers coming in that our system cant currently take cards which means cash only  we cant currently look up  process  or release any online orders  and we cant get a hold of anybody that isnt within shouting distance  Luckily were not very busy  at least on my end of the store  but the first customer I get who came in before we started having the issues  seems to take it personal that something went wrong with our system and that I cant take his debit card as payment  I apologize but he just goes on a rant about how he needs all of this right now and we should know when our system will be back up  yeah sure  Ive totally got clairvoyance  and how is it possible that it went down and blah blah blah  Cant he leave this on hold with us and we call him back when the system comes up  Nope sorry  we only do will calls for items that have been paid for  We dont hold unpaid items because they take up space we dont have  And anyway I highly doubt the will call system is even currently functional at the moment since nothing else is currently working By the time this guy is done ranting at me he decides to add more items to his order which is already well over the couple hundred in cash he had on him and then informs me that were gonna become friends because hes going to stand there in front of me until the system comes back up    hits and its time for my lunch and another cashier comes down saying that theyve had luck running debit cards as credit and to try that  which I suggest to my customer to get him out of my face  He completely ignores my instructions to run it as credit and puts in his PIN but by some miracle the transaction went through  I get a hold of lumber to get the guy the rest of his stuff  listen to him bitch about a couple more things then make my escape to get lunch  By about  everything got fixed again and we didnt have to continue to listen to customers whine about a technical issue we had no control over but it was a long  and half hours of dealing with weird slow downs and then a complete system crash  Later heard from another coworker who came in after everything was over that it was possibly a widespread issue since he stopped at another store before he came in and they said they were also having internet problems  Also another cashier said a customer said they lived in a nearby neighborhood where everyone also lost internet so who knows  But you gotta love the customers who think we personally made our system crash just to cause them issues,6413,1197

535,jkbyxd,1,94,How I kept my job after giving away   worth of product  For about a year in high school I worked at an international retail store in the US  Employees of this company would get a   discount on merchandise  Naturally I would use this anytime that I bought things for myself  However  as a cashier you see all different sorts of people in all different sorts of situations  I was seeing single mothers with several children who are buying baby food  wipes  diapers  clothing  etc  People who are in situations where they obviously cannot afford what theyre buying but they have to buy it anyways  I had the bright idea of using my discount to help them out  on the register or I was logged into  using my ID card  Do you see where this is going  It felt really good to see the looks of appreciation on these peoples faces  so I kept doing it I ended up doing it half a dozen times over the course of several weeks before management called me to the back room to have a chat  Apparently  whenever you use your discount on a register that youre signed into it creates a red flag in the system  The manager who was supposed to be tracking that was on vacation for a week at the time and didnt catch it until I had already given away   worth of discounts The two managers that were talking to me in the room brought me in there with the intent to fire me  they told me this afterwards  when they asked me why I did it I explained them and that I was only doing it for the people who clearly really needed the help  and what I was giving discounts on   They shared a look between themselves for a few seconds and I could see a silent exchange happen  They decided to keep me around,1703,320
536,jjuf75,1,85,No good deed goes unpunished So I worked for a dollar store chain when there was a coin shortage  We were encouraged to ask customers if they had change so we wouldnt deplete  the change in our till  I usually kept a little change on me for customers who were just a few pennies over so they wouldnt have to break a bill  Most customers were very appreciative of this One day  I asked a customer if she had the correct change and she said she didnt  Her total was    or something close to that and she was paying with a   bill  So I put in the extra change to give her the   change  She asked where her change was and I explained that I put the extra pennies in for her  She loses it and demands a refund of her transaction so she can pay with a card instead  I had to call my supervisor to do the refund  holding up my line for several minutes  The customer then blames me for the customers behind her being delayed  all over  cents  The other customers were upset  with her  not me  because of the situation I learned no good deed goes unpunished I guess  I quit a couple weeks later for a better job that pays more and is less stressful,1153,224

538,jjkqfa,1,23,A rude customer made me cry today  I recently got a job as a cashier  Overall its an okay job  not the worst retail job Ive ever had  Ive had customer service cashier experience for a couple years now so rude customers are nothing new  But let me get on with what happened I was cashiering and this older woman comes up to me  She says she would like to make a suggestion for me  that I start asking if the customer would like their receipt back after doing a return  She goes on about how she needed her receipt because she had other stuff she could have returned  She was pretty angry about it so my first response was    me personally   She says angrily  yes you  You threw away my receipt after a return and didnt even ask if I wanted it    Now  i have always asked the customer if they want to keep their old receipt after doing a return  If they say they dont want it  I simply throw it away  I guess defending myself became my downfall  I say to her   I always ask customers if they want to keep their receipt  she says to me  actually yelling this time   no you did not you threw it away      I said  I dont appreciate the way youre talking to me   She is still yelling at me and being extremely upset over this and taking it very personally with me  I have never had a customer actually yell at me before  I proceed to call my manager  and over the phone I explain that I have an aggressive customer who is yelling at me  The lady says   I am not yelling at you  Wow  You are a sad little girl and I feel sorry for you   That really got to me and I started tearing up  I dont even recall ever seeing this lady before  Again  she was very personal with me and even looked at my name tag and said my name  She goes  she was at that register and I remember the blonde hair and everything    To my manager when he eventually showed up  And she completely denied ever yelling at me or being upset  She said  I never raised my voice at her   She did  she was extremely nasty   My manager takes care of her and rings her up since she was buying stuff  I had to take a breather and go to the back and I just cried in the break room  My coworkers saw  I was just embarrassed and didnt expect to be crying so much  I wish I didnt take things so personally  I would really appreciate any comments on this post  Ive just been crying on and off today because Ive had to deal with so many nasty people lately  I just dont understand why people have to be so rude,2471,482
539,jjh22q,1,0,Self Checkout Mess This is a story from quite a few years back  The store I worked for was one of the first in our community to get self checkouts  Being one of the younger and more technologically savvy cashiers  I was tasked with running these machines  As the technology was so new at the time  Id often end up taking more of a teaching role with customers  showing them how to use the machine to check out as efficiently as possible  I like to think I was pretty good at helping people use them  A few months later  we were approaching Christmas  We were understaffed  no surprise  as we were always understaffed  but even more so than usual   so there was just one till open and the four self checkouts that I was maintaining   The person on the till had a huge line  and so did the self checkouts  An elderly man approached me with questions about how to use the machine  so I went over with him and helped him  As Im working with him  a mother and her  or  year old son  who is sitting in the cart  start using another one of the machines  I continue to help the man  but then I hear a strange sound I turn around to see that the kid has whipped down his pants and started pissing all over the floor  and let me tell you  it was A LOT of piss  I was a bit dumbfounded as to how a kid that age could possibly think that it was okay to do that  and to how his mom was seemingly unfazed by this  and just continued to scan her items  She finished checking out  and approached me  She said  condescendingly  Youd better clean that up   and walked away  I could understand if the kid was  or   but from my limited knowledge of child rearing  he was past the typical age for potty training  and more than capable of being taught that you dont whip down your pants and piss in the middle of a store  The mom just didnt care  at all  I think working in retail has given me both an education in what not to do as a parent  and a hesitancy to become a parent in the first place,1992,380

542,jj9t7b,1,123,Persistent Check Casher Okay so this happened to me yesterday  but according to coworkers has been happening since Friday  Like my last post  this took place at the gas station job and it pertains a certain customer determined to cash a check  It was a normal Monday night  which by that I meant   of our sales was alcohol since the store is in a neighborhood full of alcoholics  We often get checks written over the amount for cash back so I usually don’t think too much about it so long as they have an ID on hand  Well  this one lady came in and with a small handful of things to buy  delivered me a prewritten check well over the total for cash back  It raised numerous red flags right away  Here’s the thing  our store is the one of the few in my city that that takes out of town checks  But we don’t take checks from out of state  So if you have a check from Florida  you won’t be able to use it here  Her check was from Minnesota  though her ID was of this state Second was that it wasn’t a bank check  We will accept credit union checks only if the union is one from our town but we don’t take checks from out of town unions  I usually distrust prewritten checks  It’s my own personal thing  I prefer to see the check written when people pay with one It was over the total amount  on its own not bad  but the check was roughly  dollars over   is our max for cash back  It was written in red ink  And unless something changed  banks can’t accept checks in red because something about their systems  Save for prewritten  all of those are grounds to refuse because store rules  But when I explained it to her  good Lord you’d though I hit her and then threw her dog off a bridge  She was offended and pissed and kept going on and on over how we always take her checks  how I’m so unreasonable and being an incredibly rude employee for refusing  I explained to her the rules again and specified that Our Owners specifically told us not to accept checks that did any of those things  Oh no no no  she wanted me to call the manager  Claimed to be best friends with the manager  It was past nine at night our manager would have been asleep because she does the am opening  I told her that no  I’m not going to wake my manager up for this  if you claim to be such good friends then go ahead and call her  She didn’t  of course At that point she had gotten some others attention in the store and one of our regulars in the casino had come out and was standing off to the side to see if he needed to intervene  he’s a very big guy  but very nice  always steps in when our drunk customers get out of hand   I just told her she needs to leave Instead of leaving with her dignity  she threw the check at me and said she’d be back for her money  that she’ll call the owner and that I can kiss this job goodbye  and I won’t have any luck getting employed anywhere else with my attitude  Of course  she never came back my shift  I informed my boss and left a note for the manager in the morning  Found she’s been coming in at different times these past few days trying to find an employee who’d cash the check  Would have had better luck if the ink wasn’t red,3180,611

544,jiucl5,1,25,Sure  let me go get a screwdriver    Some context  I am a customer service manager in a large department store  Today  I had the pleasure of attempting to fix a non functioning register  The screen wouldn’t turn on  I am not exceptionally tech savvy  but I can generally figure out which cables go where and why and perform basic troubleshooting  When my best efforts yielded no results  I called tech support  Enter Juan  Juan  after walking me through the same troubleshooting steps that I had just performed  asked me to email him a picture of this register  It’s different than every other register in the store  Turns out  Juan has never seen a register like this before in his life  Juan  “Can you switch out the screen with a functional screen from another register  That way we can tell if it’s the screen or the cable ”I very quickly realized this wasn’t going to work  Not only are the other screens very different  the connecting cables are as well  There is no way to connect the existing tower to a different screen  I don’t have the right cables  I explained this to Juan  Juan  “Can you put the broken screen on a different register  then ”Me  “No  as I explained  I don’t have the correct cables ”Juan  “Then can you at least move the cables and a functioning screen onto the tower you are working on ”Me  “No  the other end of the cables aren’t the correct ones either ”Juan  “Ma’am  I’m trying to help you  If you aren’t willing to try then I’m not sure what else I can do for you ”Me  “Listen  The cables to this monitor are different from all the other ones I have  They are USB on one end  The other registers don’t even have USB ports  The power cords are completely different shapes  THERE IS NOT A HOLE THAT WILL FIT THE POWER CABLE  It’s not that I’m not willing to try  I CAN’T ”Juan  “Can you make a hole that will fit ”Me   after several seconds of shocked silence  “Sure  Let me go get a screwdriver ”I hung up on him  I do not get paid enough for this  I’d love to have seen my boss’s face when I explained that we had to ship a register back because I stabbed it with a screwdriver to accommodate the wrong power cord though,2180,389
545,jiqefx,1,13,Rain Check Please I work for a midsized supermarket chain  We have weekly sales as most stores do and our sale week runs from Thursday to Wednesday  As the sales week runs down  so do the items in the ad due to item movement or out of stocks  The necessary evil of running out of sale items is issuing rain checks  We try our best to accommodate the customer by substitutions  but generally they are issued a rain check  Usually our customers do not abuse the rain check policy  but there was one gentleman who always took advantage of it  Every Wednesday night like clockwork  he came in to  collect   his multiple rain checks  He is in his right to do so  but one Wednesday he stopped in his tracks  What he would do is go to the shelf  look for a sale item  see how many are there then go to our customer service booth and ask for a raincheck  The booth person would then page the department to see if there are more of this item in our back room  The gentleman saw that there were only  boxes of a certain cracker  but wanted seven   some items have no limits  and wanted a rain check to add to his collection  Well  on the this particular occasion  we had just gotten a large deliver of said crackers and were able to get him his th box  I brought them to him and it was this point he said    it wasnt  boxes that I needed  it was    I said ok and then proceeded to get him  more boxes  As I gave them to him he became flustered and I wondered what was wrong  He told me he didnt want the item  he just wanted the rain check  I said that since we have the items in stock  there was no need to issue a rain check  Then he asked me    how can I buy this item when it is not on sale without a rain check    I told him that he has the requested sale items and the transaction is complete  I explained were not giving rain checks out for the items we have  He spent another  minutes getting more rain checks  but for at least a moment  he was rightfully halted,1972,391
546,jin1w0,1,27,Being told to shut up  and what happened after So this was a few years ago  when I was still a cashier at a certain blue themed department store  We offered a no taxes discount on applicable items to those with a Native Status card  and to apply this they needed to present the card at the beginning of the order  we would check it for validity  and the order could begin  Well  one fated day  a couple comes through  maybe mid to late thirties  and they have a medium sized order  which I process with no problems  no indication of what is to come until I tell them their total  The man says they have a status card  and I tell him that unfortunately they would have needed to declare it at the beginning of the order for me to apply the discount  The woman starts insisting that we can do it for her  that weve done it before etc  So I call the CSM  Customer Service Manager  equivalent of a front end supervisor  over  explain the situation  and ask if theres anything we can do  I still want to help the customer at this point  even if shes been a little rude  The CSM explains that short of erasing the order and scanning it in again  this time with the discount in place  theres nothing to be done  The woman chooses that  and while the CSM is erasing the order  I say in an apologetic tone   Sorry  this is why we need you to show us the card at the beginning of the order   by which I meant that it would take even longer for them to be able to leave  Admittedly  this was not the best thing I could have said at the time  but she snapped at me  not an exact quote  but the gist of what she actually said   I knew that you could do it  so dont be stupid   I said something else  I think something to the effect of  Please dont call me that  maam   to which she replied even more venomously  and although I dont remember the first part of her sentence  I could never forget the second part   Maybe its time for you to shut up   I had never been told to shut up by a customer before  Id had my fair share of rude customers before  to be sure  and even been sworn at and had my intelligence insulted  but for some reason being told to shut up like that was the tipping point  because I did shut up  and after they were gone  the man whose order was next asked if I was alright  and all I could do was ask another CSM if I could to the bathroom  where I promptly burst into tears  When I came out  obviously still quite upset but not crying anymore  the front end manager told me to take my lunch early When I came back is when this story takes a turn  Apparently the manager and yet another CSM had been standing at the front doors  watching for this couple to drive by  and when they saw them  the front end manager actually ran after their car  and when he managed to stop them  went off on them about how they treated me and proceeded to ban them from the store  I hadnt particularly gotten along with my manager before then  hes harmless  just very outgoing and slightly odd personality  but this incident instilled me with a newfound respect for him  and a stiffer upper lip around customers,3117,594

550,jht50q,1,1,The Poor Cup I’ve written here before  but hello  I had to ring up a customer who looked like she just ran in from a rain storm  Facial expression  hair  everything  I would’ve believed it if not for the fact there’s hardly rain here and it’s sunny as usual   At least as sunny as it can get after sunset   They were a bit rude to me which made me mad later when I found out  She has two women  I think teen girls possibly  and a little boy about  or   Keep that in mind I’m not sure if it happened before I rang this customer up or after but one of my co workers comes up to the register and tells us about how another co worker found one of our mugs with pee in it  It had been far under a shelf so she didn’t know until she had picked it up and taken it out  I didn’t hear much about it from her herself till the next day when we were clocking in  She wanted to check the cameras and find out if she can see who did it  It was a fairly empty store  so while the cameras suck horribly  it would be fairly obvious who it had been if we looked We go to a time late at night but before the registers get counted  I put it on x and we watch several people wander through the aisle the cup was found  The shelf  best we could see it  was luckily in view and appeared empty  This group  the one I rang out later  That one   went into that aisle  Suddenly  one of the younger girls takes the boy into another aisle where we have ceramics  They grab something  I know already  it’s the mug based on everything after  and bring it back into the aisle with the other two  Then  they crowd around  and after that one ducks down  They’re all acting really suspicious but there isn’t anyone around to see  The girl stands up and then hides the cup on the shelf  where later  to confirm it  we watch as my co worker picks it up and then notices it’s filled with urine  I assume they had the boy pee in it and crowded around him to keep him hidden as the girl helped him  Even if it was the girl herself doing it  which I doubt  the boy was with them  They later check out and leave the store  As to why they felt the need to do that  I don’t know  If I see them I’m likely going to tell them they can’t come in after that  I asked around and no one encountered them  and they’ve never been here before at least from what I can remember  so I don’t know what their deal was,2372,475
551,jhq2fj,1,177,Dude  really  My store has a weekly   off a certain amount sale each Saturday  No problems there  Its the digital coupon for this sale that bothers me  Do you know why  Because it doesnt get priority over other coupons during checkout  What happened tonight really put that in perspective Theres an older man  possibly s to s  who I only see on Saturday for the sale  Normally  hes really calm  but tonight he acted different after I told him his total  The register didnt take his   off coupon  This time  he had an unused   off coupon that usually takes priority during checkout  He told me the small bowl of dog food should be free because of a vendor coupon  and it was  After checking and adding up his savings  we saw it wasnt   off  He asked if I could just knock off the   since the register chose the wrong coupon  and I told him Im not in control of which coupon the register uses  and he looks very disappointed Old man   So  theres nothing you can do about this giving me the wrong deal  How long have you been working here  that they havent shown you how to do that  That makes no sense  Just go in and take the   off instead  That  or change the price since Im a regular  Me  Im sorry  but I cant do anything about this  If theres a coupon thats less than our current sale  then it takes priority  This has nothing to do with my decision  I can ring everything back up and try again  but if the   off is all itll do  my hands are tied  He looks pissed  Ive never seen him frown  let alone look or sound angry  He tells me to take an item off to see if itll work  like that would change anything 🙄   but I do it anyway to prove a point    off coupon pops up again  and now hes finally calming down  only to see it was still there Old man   Now I know youre doing it  Theres no way it would use the same coupon TWICE  I dont want   off  I  WANT  FIVE  DOLLARS  OFF  Fix it or Im calling your manager up here to do it for you  Me   Sir  Ive done nothing but scan your items  hit total  and tell you what to pay  Theres no decision on my part  Theres also no change I can make on this transaction  I have nothing else to tell you  He looked so mad Old man   THEN TAKE ALL OF IT OFF SO I CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE  IM TIRED OF ALL THESE STORES TELLING ME HOW MY MONEY WORKS  THANKS FOR NOTHING  Me   Okay  Ill take everything off  Have a good night  He grabs his buggy by the handle  swings it off sideways hitting another womans buggy  She wasnt paying attention  so she was basically gut punched by the handle of her cart out of nowhere  I told him itd be best if he didnt come back here because hell be asked to leave on sight  Hell be banned by Monday  All of this over   extra  Shameful Btw  I was the manager tonight  He wouldve had to ask me to fix a problem for myself  He probably assumed I was the cashier because mine was in the bathroom TL DR  An old man throws a temper tantrum because dog food was   more than expected  then unintentionally hurts a woman out of anger  My register works fine,3081,580
552,jg6f4t,1,44,The Piano Incident I worked as an assistant manager for a thrift store  I was essentially the Operations and Facilities Manager as the store manager was fairly inept in those areas  how he got the SM job Ill never know Anyway  we had a piano that had been donated that had obviously been tipped over as the sounding board had a giant crack in it  It was an upright piano but was older and you could tell it was monstrously heavy just by looking at it  We kicked around the idea of what to do with it for a couple of weeks when my SM said to load it in our truck and haul it to the dump  We rolled it out back and there is sat for a week or so while I waited for enough guys to be on shift to help push it up the ramp into the truck A day before our dumpster pickup I got to work and saw a utility crew out back doing some street work  I peeked in our dumpster and noted that it wasnt quite half full  Not wanting to waste an opportunity  I walked out to the utility crew and asked them how much weight their skid steer could lift and if they thought it could lift the piano  A few minutes later  theyre lifting the piano into the dumpster for me  it fit perfectly The next day  I just happened to be finishing up loading scrap metal into our metal recycling dumpster when the trash dumpster pickup occurred  I tried to keep my cool and watch out of the corner of my eye The loader groaned a little over the weight of the dumpster and when it got to the top dump point  the piano got hung up just a little and he needed to shake the bucked a little to dislodge it  The driver saw me and shouted over  What do you have in there  I began making my way back to the door and just casually said   A piano  He was almost fuming   How the       did you get a piano in there   As I was opening the door to go back in I replied   Just roll it up to the dumpster and lift   like it was nothing special  I let the door close behind me but not before seeing the look of astonishment on his face I think he was too afraid to NOT empty the dumpster  Maybe he thinks Im secretly the Hulk or something but it was one of the best moments of my  years there,2160,424
553,jg5boz,1,43,Store gets backlash for not stocking more Halloween items before Halloween Ever wonder why stores always stock up on Halloween items in August  and Christmas items in October  It’s to intentionally get more customers to buy these items early  They further enforce this by not stocking up on more seasonal items as it gets closer to that holiday  Halloween seems to be notorious for this  as was my experience when I worked for a major retail chain a few years ago I was hired around Halloween time  so  of course  Halloween items were at the peak of demand  Contrary to retail’s practices  nobody buys Halloween stuff in August  They usually wait until mid September at the very earliest  Humans are notorious procrastinators  and will put off their seasonal shopping until the last minute  expecting they’ll get everything they want on or right before October st  Our store learned this the hard way By the end of October  our store was already packed with Christmas items while the Halloween section remained scarce  There wasn’t much left besides some home decor  cheap costumes  and a few bags of unpopular candy  My colleagues and I faced more than a few customers getting mad or cussing us out for no longer stocking anymore Halloween items  I remember my coworker getting an earful from a lady wanting a brain jello mold  and telling her “M’am  we had all these items up since August ” I did my best to be polite  of course  but it was still a pain  Thankfully  I didnt work on Halloween night  I can only imagine the horrors of a customer finding costume at the very last minute Moral of the story  artificial scarcity helps no one  especially not the overworked and underpaid employees Happy Halloween  everyone TL DR  Store stops stocking Halloween items by Halloween  Customers get mad  and the employees face their outrage,1848,307
554,jfyjk8,1,163,SIGNS everywhere  People still ignore  I work in a place that has two joined stores owned by the same people  It is a small group of about  total locations in the city  People KNOW we have two separate stores in one building divided by a wall  The stores do sell some associated products  but generally depending on who you are and what you need you’ll fare better at one vs the other  Basically the store I work at is the “professional use” stuff and the one next door is the “personal recreational use” stuff  We have signs  Signs on the road visible from the highway  Signs over the doors  Signs on the doors  Signs inside the doors    SIGNS People clearly looking for the recreational side will hesitate and read the sign on the door outside stating not only that if you need XYZ for personal or recreational use  go to the other side  but if you do not have a permit  license  and proof of occupation  much of the stuff in the professional side is off limits and we legally cannot sell it to you  They will then open the door  enter  read the IDENTICAL signs inside  blankly stare at the signs  and approach the front desk  We are basically required to check credentials and ID of all people that come in  Even if we know them personally because paperwork and clerical things can and do change in a snap  I get at least   people a day on weekdays  and   on weekends  closed Sunday though  that go like this  Me  Hello  How can I help you Them  I am looking for product X  where can I find that Me  excellent  may I see your credentials Them  Huh Me  Credentials  they come on a card like your driver’s license  and tell me you work for XYZ Them  Oh I’m a  insert any other occupation here   we don’t have that Me  are you looking for Y Store Them  Yes  That’s you isn’t it Me  No  they are next door  on the other side of the building  We only share this wall  Out the door and take a right and you’ll see an identical door labeled Y Store  Bonus points if they linger and insist on looking around anyway    there is really only one thing we can sell them without credentials  work boots  If they do stick around we are also required to watch them like a hawk  Many smaller items we carry could be easily stolen,2246,407
555,jfqcjr,1,25,The Poultry Catastrophe So I used to work in a grocery store in my town  and I have collected quite a few stories from there and my time abroad and I have finally convened on this location to share one of my plethora of memories   Depending on how this post is received I may pump more experiences out here  so I hope you guys enjoy Now I think many of us enjoy a good meme here and there  a funny joke etc   I for one enjoy humor and employ it as a method to both ease my tension and  hopefully  entertain the customer of which I was scanning out at the checkout line   It was a week before Thanksgiving and Im sure many retail workers know firsthand how chaotic that time can be  and so much jokes were much more prevalent   While I was checking out  my supervisor hands me a frozen turkey  stating that it needs to go back to the meat department and that shed take over for me while I go personally deliver it   This is routine and I thought nothing of it  so I accepted and headed towards the meat department   I arrive at the frozen turkey selection and place a turkey down within the freezer   It is then when a friendly old lady walked up to me and asked  excused me OP  do these turkeys get any bigger    Remembering a certain meme I had found  I chuckle and say  no maam  theyre dead    She laughs wholeheartedly along with me  and I tell her Ill check with the meat department since Im only a cashier and theyd have a larger turkey for her   She thanks me and I meet with the meat manager in their cooler and tell him about the customer   I then retire back to my post on the checkout line   Now  after this I hadnt thought anything of this little interaction   I would have forgotten about it altogether if it wasnt for my manager calling me to her office to talk to me   Apparently my joke had gotten a complaint from a customer   The customer had told my manager that my joke about dead turkeys was insensitive towards the animal and that I wouldnt be making those jokes about people so why should I with turkeys  I totally would by the way    We both agree that it was kind of stupid and that I shouldnt have done it  but she did find the joke funny so I think I got off easy with that one   Now a few hours have gone by  and I am on self checkout when a lady approaches me   At first she didnt look out of the ordinary from her leather purse  fur coat and overall karen esque appearance  and I met with her with my usual cheerfulness    Hello  my name is OP how may I help you  I asked   The lady reveals herself as the filer of the complaint  stating that I shouldve been fired for what I said   I accidentally let out a little chuckle and say  so it was you    Everything had made sense to me at that point   This lady had overheard my joke with the older lady and had taken offense to it   She begins to berate me saying that if someone were to joke about my death I wouldnt take kindly to it   I politely retort  maam  I wouldnt mind because Id be dead  and she starts fuming   I know I was stirring a hornets nest  but man was I having fun   However  even Nostradamus couldnt predict what this lady was about to do   With a smug confidence  she got in my face and said  would you kill me if I was a turkey    She then starts doing chicken motions and making chicken noises at me  and I couldnt help myself   I start laughing  and oh man it was not a gentle laugh either   My sides began to hurt but I couldnt help myself  this Karen just looked SO stupid   From the other self checkout kiosks I could see customers stifling giggles and pointing towards the chicken Karen  I will call her Choco Karen because I play way too much FF and chocobos are like chickens    Choco Karen  now finished with her poultry outburst  repeated her question    If I was a turkey  would you kill me    While I was enjoying this tirade  all good things must come to an end so I begrudgingly told her  maam Im gonna have to ask you to leave  youre causing a disturbance for the other customers    What I should have expected was her following wrath  but alas I did not  how could a woman who had an outburst like that remain calm after being told to leave  me from the past wasnt that smart    She demanded that I answered her question and I responded  no  I wouldnt kill you but I would call security if you do that again    We did not actually have store security  but it was a little tactic I would use to intimidate people being rowdy   Fortunately  Choco Karen seemed to be deterred  and as she walked towards the door she began to yell the standard spiel like  I wont ever shop here again until you get fired  and even called me an animal hater  I have two dogs and generally spend more time with peoples pets than the person themselves so thats a lie    I wont forget her last words though   As she walked out the door  she yelled  Your soul will burn unless you repent you animal killer    Now as my tale comes to a close  I cant help but explain the aftermath   A few employees who had heard the incident had told a few more employees  and through word of mouth within the hour everyone in the store had known of my encounter with Choco Karen   I would never see Choco Karen again  so she was true to her word but I would earn a title of  Turkey Bastard  which I wore proudly until I finally left that position a couple years later   Now  as I sit here several years later recalling the events of this story  which I am sure I may have forgotten a few details   I cant help but ask the question   Why was someone like Choco Karen in the meat department anyway,5613,1092

564,jeyiav,1,9,Morning Silliness So here is where I put my obligatory “I’m on mobile” spiel  I am a sales associate in a hardware store  and this just happened to me this morning No  this is not a Karen vs Robotic Employee  This is just something we all laughed about A nice lady came in this morning and came up to my register as I was doing the vicod cleaning  She came up to ask me if we had a certain kind of steps in our store that allow someone to go inside a building and had a weight capacity of  pounds  I thought she was looking for a step ladder  but she quickly said it was something else  My manager asked her about what she was looking for and was just as puzzled at me  until after I started ringing someone else up and the customer called her husband He said he’d seen them up front in our store  and then when she said that to me  it clicked   He saw the steps we use for things like stocking up front and thought it was for sale  Poor woman had to be the sweetest person about it  but she was slightly embarrassed about it and asked us where she could get one  We said we didn’t know  and off she went I smile about it when I think about what happened now  The nicest woman with the weirdest request  in our store and my day  Takeaway  don’t assume that stuff kept up front is for sale,1306,252

566,jevfrn,1,21,Ma’am   plus  does indeed equal  So this happened a couple months back  but I figured I’d share with you guys  So I work in a place that has tire center  and I tend to be up in the sales area helping people get the right tires for their car  We usually have promotions that give you either  or  off a set of  tires  The way the discount gets credited is that you get  dollars off of each tire install  so  total since it’s one install per tire  and then the rest gets taken off the subtotal A lady came in that had ordered tires a couple days prior  claiming that we didn’t give her the full  off  Now  this happens very frequently since it’s not obvious that you’re not getting the full  off  as it only says   under the tire price  I explain to her how the discount works  and clarify that she did get the full discount  She then claims that the promotion is false advertising  since it’s not explained that way anywhere I proceed to tell her that she is indeed still getting  off  and that while it’s a little odd in how it’s credited  we’re not giving her less than that  Then she demands that we give her the other  off  and I again explain that she already has the other  off her price  This back and forth continues on for a couple minutes  and I eventually tell her that I’ll get the supervisor to come help her out  since this was well above my pay grade Apparently  she ended up going to management  claiming again that it’s false advertising and that she wants the extra  off  Obviously she got it  since the customer is always right  and everything went smoothly after that  Just goes to show that if you whine and complain enough as a customer  you’ll get what you want  And in the end  we have recently been taking the full discount value off the cost outright instead of splitting it,1842,348
567,jev4qi,1,10,I SAID HORIZONTAL NOT VERTICAL  No VERTICAL Hopefully you guys enjoy this My job is mainly a desk job  but occasionally we have walk ins to drop off items for repair  The company I work for does blind repair  installation  and consultations  I do the booking for all of this between customers  vendors  and organizations     of the customers are awesome  and the people I work for are so nice its unreal  But yesterday I got  THAT  person on the phone   I got a call from a lady who wanted pricing  Okay  easy  Our minimum charge for a housecall is    and it cleans  horizontal blinds    apiece if you break it down   She said okay  She then asked about blinds over doors  I asked are they horizontal or vertical  she said vertical  I told her its    per slat  think generic apartment plastic slat blinds  but the minimum charge is still     She got mad and this was our exchange Customer   Each slat is      Thats ridiculous  you guys have gone up in price and you expect me to COUNT the slats  Me   Ive only worked here for about  months  I cant control pricing  If it helps  most vertical blind sets have about   slats  so roughly      per set of the vertical blind  Customer   I never said they were vertical  theyre HORIZONTAL I get confused   she just said vertical for the door blinds   but okay Me   Okay sorry about that  I misunderstood  Again  for cleaning blinds  its a minimum of    for a house call  and that will clean up to  blinds  That makes each horizontal blind     If your door blinds are also horizontal and they dont exceed  blinds  youll still be paying     If they are only vertical blinds  the price will vary but we still require the    minimum   Customer   WELL  WHY DO I HAVE TO COUNT THE SLATS  I CANT POSSIBLY DO THAT  Me   Maam we only count the slats on vertical blinds  and the technicians will do it when they arrive at your house anyway for the cleaning   Seriously you cant count to   Its that hard  Customer   Okay  so each vertical blind is     Me        Yes  I left it at that  She got so upset with me and actually yelled at me because she doesnt have common sense  She didnt end up scheduling and hasnt called back since  The pricing is actually not that complicated  From what I understood the first time she spoke  she had  horizontal blinds  and  sets of vertical  So the horizontals would cost a total of     and based on however many vertical blinds she had  the cost of them would be tacked onto the     But she kept using horizontal and vertical interchangeably and I lost track  Thats too much work for a Monday,2676,463
568,jeuerx,1,0,My nightmare working as a janitor in a craft store  First post here dont know if this breaks rule  but here it is I do not hold any resentment towards my workplace as a whole there were alot of good memories here but alot of them were calm of the storm deals  This is simply to tell the pain of working as a janitor in a craft store To set the scene this is fresh out of high school Ive never had a job in high school so I was desperate to find work and found this job rather quickly First day and they immediately let me know Im replacing someone that they had to fire after a month  I see why now   this is followed up by them dropping a manual in my lap sending me to the lunch room and telling me to read it over  I didnt learn this until  months later but that was not the right manual it was the maintenance manual not the operators manual So right now I have no idea how to work the cleaning machine and management has no idea how to work it cut to  months later and there floors arent getting clean to store standards  I wonder why  Im trying my best but again still dont really know how to work that machine  At this point Ive also had to deal with the stock crew smashing glitter on the floor  paint spills  machine errors and the cleaner used in the machine eating my clothing It got worse in month   Now in September they hired a new morning manager to oversee stock for the winter season  then in October they hired another manager to oversee the stock people and frame makers and then finally in November they hired a manager for the cleaning crew to which I was the only person on said crew  The worst part is he didnt help me clean he just made sure I did the cleaning and then helped stock the shelves Wrapping all the problems up we have  improperly trained staff  impossible to clean up messes  more maintenance problems than you can shake a stick at   managers doing absolutely nothing in there department  snow on the ground which means bigger messes  my clothes getting eaten by the cleaners and lastly black Friday coming up The boiling point came that Thanksgiving Day  American  right before black Friday  I normally had to spend   on pants so I could have work appropriate attire in my size  That morning my last pair had burn holes in them from the cleaners used by the machine I decided to ask them to even reimburse me half as that would be how much I would need to buy Nother proper work attire set of pants  They denied it saying I should be more careful and that uniform was provided by yourself not them  The day was just starting from there now I am off for  day as my city allows for janitorial under law  however during that day someone used the machine and let it sit overnight without dumping it making a sludgey glitter dirt mess that I had to wash out by hand  Now one last note on this machine the recover tank hose is hard to control as you had to stretch it in order to get the hose into the broom closet with the drain  This was the biggest reason for my pants being eaten as the water would splash up from the amount of water coming from the recovery tank speckling my pants with small amount of cleaner water  Couple all of this with someone yelling at me for not cleaning the Womens bathroom on my day off and getting mad about a stupid spot  her words were a  customer  complained about the back of the toilet in stall   Which is tiny and almost impossible to see in the back unless youre on your hands and knees looking for dirt  I was already pretty defeated that day and with alot of pressure to get the job done for black Friday I was almost at my breaking point  Finally after starting the dump for the sludge from the machine I noticed something strange on the coupler ring holding the outtake hose to the machines intake tank  It was leaking pretty bad and just as I was about to get the manual to see what the problem was the hose came flying off dumping me in sludgy chemical saturated water  I was pissed Among the now glitter sludge covered floor I picked myself up marched to the managers office and quit right there  I saved most of the tears until after because honestly I was feeling more rage than sadness but make no mistake that I was miserable And I only look back to say that was the worst job of all time,4322,813
569,jepfnx,1,14,The Tale of the Man who Comes into Mens to Steal This might be a long one  Im in mobile so pls excuse any errors TL DL  Man gets angry he cant shoplift anymore  threatens multiple staff  then tries to fist fight  cops So  I work in a popular clothing store in the UK  which has a mens department all on one floor  Since before I even began working here  we would have this one guy come in often to steal stuff  He would come in with an empty bag  and leave with a full one  Unfortunately the mens floor is often left unattended  understaffed I suppose  so for a while this was very easy for him His old method was to go into the fitting rooms on that floor  somehow burn off the security tags  not fully sure how  but we go in after hes been there and theres tags everywhere  and one time he forgot his lighter  However  right now all our fitting rooms are closed  This means he cant go into the fitting rooms to stuff things in his bag  so if theres anyone manning the floor that can keep an eye on him  he cant steal To paint a picture of this guy  he has two main traits  he always wears a hat  often ones he stole from the store  and he always tries to act like a real customer  The latter has always been annoying  Hell call you over to ask stupid questions just to pretend he is an actual customer  Some examples are asking the price on clearly tagged items  asking where mens is  sir youre there all the time   and asking me what leggings are  when standing next to the leggings   He was once   shopping   for jeans and asked a coworker which he should get  and when asked what occasion theyre for  he said theyre for a  party  and that said  party  was renting out Ferraris and driving about in them  Yeah  sure  lmao Up until not long ago  I found him annoying but not worrying  He wastes a lot of time  he spends hours down in mens  asks stupid questions  and makes a mess assumingly to try and distract you   But then that changed  The rest of this happened a few months ago There was a week where he was in every single day  But by this point the store manager was aware of him  so she made it so the mens floor was staffed all the time  no matter what  On about the th day of coming in in a row  he started to get antsy  since he was so used to the floor being unmanned  He started asking coworkers how long theyd worked there  and where they live Then  he went from harmless werido to threatening real fast We have one manager  who Ill call Audie  who takes her job very seriously  If shes on shift and is told hes there  she will drop everything to go to mens and keep an eye on him  A close eye  And you could tell he hates her  One day hes back on mens  I think this is day  in a row  and he tells my coworker  You know that foreign girl  I hate her  She should be careful cause she doesnt know what Im capable of   Yikes  A very annoying part is we had to tell our manager  a different one to Audie  that she needs to tell the store manager this Hes in the next  days after that  because this is retail and managers never do anything At this point  I go on holiday for  weeks  When I come back  I ask my coworker if I miss anything exciting  She tells me the following   and this is where it gets more mental He threatens  more staff members to their faces  He tells one of them that hes going to kill them  and tells another thats hes going to  destroy  her  At this point  the store manager is very aware and is in constant communication with the security for the shopping mall were in  Unfortunately  the security sucks and just says  we are aware of him  He keeps coming in  and is acting more and more unhinged  Store manager tells him he needs to leave  he refuses  Security gets him out  He comes back  She tells him to leave  he says he wont  and says to call the cops So she calls the cops   woman cop shows up  and is trying to get him to leave  He refuses  The cop keeps insisting  He tries to punch her  She calls for backup A lot more cops show up  and they manage to drag him up the stairs and out the shop  The store manager has to lock the doors as he tries to keep getting in  Hes still trying to fight the cops  so more backup is brought in until theres  cops He is trying to fist fight all  cops In the end  they pin him against the glass doors to the shop  in front of all the customers inside  and arrest him  and he gets taken away He hasnt been back since  thank god TL DL  Man gets angry he cant shoplift anymore  threatens multiple staff  then tries to fist fight  cops,4580,869

584,jbiar9,1,70,Had an old man come in the other day using a card for the very first time I work register in a sporting goods store  Old guy comes up to check out  I have to ask for phone numbers to sign up for the store’s coupons  and when I ask for his he says he doesn’t remember his number because he barely uses his phone  so I just skip it  He then informs me that he’s paying with a card and has never done so before  Based off these  bits I’m assuming this man’s from like the deep countryside or something  I get Amish customers sometimes  so that’s nothing new Anyways I scan his items and it’s time for him to pay  I figure explaining how it works won’t be too difficult  I just tell him when to insert his card  when to type his pin and we’re golden  I tell him to insert his card  He tells me nothings happening  I lean over the counter to see what’s wrong  He was putting his card on top of the buttons instead of in the slot  Bless his heart  So I show him where the slot is and we continue I tell him when to type his pin  Pops up on my screen “incorrect pin ” I figure he could’ve hit a wrong button or something  I tell him “Sir  it says that was the wrong pin  Do you want to try again ” He does and we go again  But this time he starts typing his pin before the screen pops up to do so  so it only gets the last couple digits  He hits enter  some error pops up probably saying to type a full pin wasn’t looking at the screen at this time and I’ve never made this mistake  so idk what exactly it says  he types his full pin again and hits enter  but the  digits he typed were still in there  so he basically typed the second half first and the first half last  I probably should’ve been looking at the pin pad at the time and walked him through it again  but I wasn’t thinking and was filing the receipt it printed out for the failed transaction  So third times a charm right  We try again and I walk him through it again  It fails again  We try swiping it because I don’t know what to do  It doesn’t work At this point I feel real bad for the guy  There wasn’t much else I could do  He’s evidently forgotten his pin  I ask if he has enough in cash  or a checkbook even  he does not  I want to move things along because I’m getting a bit of a line  My manager was helping at the other register and notices what’s up  so she tries to help  She tries to run the card as credit  That doesn’t work  We try it as debit one more time  but at this point all the failed transactions in a row locked him out of his card  I expect him to get mad at this point  but he just sounds more disappointed than anything  My manager informs him that he’ll probably have to contact his bank to find out the pin  He says “Well alright  I’ll have to go tomorrow because it’s  minutes from my house ” I feel so bad for him at this point  Can’t help but feel it’s my fault somehow  So he leaves empty handed  Hope he found out his proper pin  And wrote it down this time,2962,590
585,jbgrdu,1,10,Encountering a shoe bandit This happened many moons ago  So dialogs are not exact  etc  etc   I worked at a minor business in a major metro area on the West Coast  The front desk has one sales lady  The place is technically open all day  but the truth is nobody comes in after  A and traffic doesnt pick up until the afternoon  Also  my area does not get much homeless bums or druggies  They generally stay downtown  which is not too far away  where they can beg for money from a lot heavier foot traffic in that area    The tiny office has a regular ground level  and a mezzanine level  There is ONE desk at the regular level for the sales lady  and my desk is at the mezzanine level  Theres a small set of stairs in between  Aside from the sales ladys desk and office chair  there are some random chairs scattered about for customers if they are waiting for the sales lady  So this day started normal  I arrived in my sneakers  just purchased off a clearance rack  no name brand at one of those discount stores  paid less than   USD    I switched to my normal work shoes  and kicked the shoes under a chair next to the stairs   This is important later   Day proceeded normally  We greeted a couple customers  I watched the last customer walked out at  A or so  Knowing things will be slow  I told her  SL  Sales Lady  to holler if she needs me  I headed upstairs to my own desk  She knew what to do and I dont bother her    Lots of different tickets to prepare  stamp  etc   It was nearly noon when when SL screamed  HELP  OP  HELP  COME DOWN HERE   in a total panic voice  I was wondering if were being robbed or something  I ran down the narrow stairs  adrenaline pumping  skid to a stop  saw SL cowering in a corner  pointing at something behind me  I turned around  and saw a half naked bum  I kid you not  sitting on the chair next to the stairs  calmly putting on my sneakers   Remember that pair I kicked under the chair   Remember  this area of town  we dont get homeless bums very often  And they dont enter businesses  And this guy    lets just say he doesnt seem all up there  Brown  pants  that seem to be only held up by a belt  no shirt  no socks  shaggy hair  doesnt seem that old  slightly unshaven  got a bit of that happy but crazy look  on drugs  high  No idea   And he was putting on my practically brand new shoes  only wore like   times  that the shoe still shined  At this point  I was more confused than angry   WTF are you doing with my shoes  man  He just shrugged   Its all cool  man  I traded ya   Then he just walked out  with my shoes on his feet  lace undone  I looked back at where he sat  and sure enough  there was a dirty as  bleep  pair of boat shoes  with holes in the sole and everything  with a thick layer of dirt and stains  By this time SL has calmed down  She doesnt mingle much with the public  mainly just the customers  and never with bums  I can see why she panicked   She asked should we call the cops  I shook my head  By the time they come out here  the perp would be long gone  And what am I going to do  Demand my shoes back   Yuk  So just bagged that sorry pair of shoes and tossed them in the bin  And thus ended my encounter with the shoe bandit,3257,615
586,jbghik,1,26,“This is how you people do business  ” I worked in customer at a large corporation for over a year and have so many stories  One of my favorites is a customer coming in seeking “satisfaction”  So at our store we sell riding lawn mowers and the customer has the option to have the company come out and assemble it for them  The customer was unhappy that they did not also assemble an add on to the product and made a big scene  There is nothing we can do in this situation except to direct the customer to call the company who provides the service  Mind you  the customer did not even say what he wanted he just started complaining  So eventually we got the manager who explained this to the customer to which the customer said “I ain’t callin no  insert company name  I bought the product here and I am seeking satisfaction from right here”  He then went on to incredulously ask us “is this how you people do business ” The whole ordeal took about   minutes and the customer never asked for money back or any sort of compensation  he came just to complain  He eventually walked away yelling “this is how you people do business here ”It was very uncomfortable but also looking back quite funny at the overreaction to avoiding calling another company,1257,225

595,jagzut,1,14,Thats not how it works  Lady So this happened a few years ago  I dont even work in retail anymore but it suddenly vividly popped into my head just now and I felt the same rage I did back then for a second so I came straight here  So the shop I worked at had a policy about selling only  boxes of painkillers per customer  just because if they happen to overdose its not on us at all  Obviously they can go to more stores and buy more  but it just means that we werent responsible for selling them all  boxes they took if that makes sense  This was never a problem  maybe an eyeroll here and there but usually it was just an  oh okay Ill just buy two then  great  no problem  Anyway  a lady and her daughter come in and start putting their things down on the belt and I instantly spotted the  boxes of ibuprofen and said  ah Im sorry I can only sell you two of those boxes its company policy   she instantly snaps at me saying she doesnt understand why  I tried to explain the policy as best as I could  all while she looked at me like I had  heads  rolling her eyes every few seconds  She even said defensively  Im not trying to dispute the rules   but like  whats this then  She then says  right well theyre my daughters she can buy  of them separately  there   boxes per customer  I was like fine whatever shes a grown woman she can buy them Im not going to argue anymore  and so I put  at the back with a till divider in front  I finished scanning everything  which took a while might I add  and right as I scanned the very last thing this lady finally goes  ughhh some of this is my daughters it needed to be scanned separately   I  what  I just said  oh Im sorry I didnt realise  thinking internally why didnt you say anything  anyway she paid  I gave her the receipt  then I scanned the  boxes of ibuprofen for her daughter and said the price  the Mum holds up her debit card again and waits for the card machine  Oh great just what I need  I said  um  you said they were your daughters   she frowns and tilts her head forward at me like Im an actual idiot and says  theyre FOR her Im buying them FOR her  I said  but its  per customer I was under the impression that she would be buying them herself   This lady does the angriest sigh Ive ever heard and aggressively pulls a £ note out of her purse  waves it mockingly by her daughters hands for a second then slams it on my till  I just stared at  her blankly  thought you know what  Whatever I cant deal with this  Scooped it up angrily  shoved it in my till and started to gather the change  I decided to take a breath and not let a stupid customer get to me so as I gave her the change I said calmly  I am sorry  Im really just trying to follow the rules  this lady  snaps    DO NOT argue with me  I am NOT arguing with you   I was actually dumbfounded and said  more bitterly now I admit   Im just doing my job  she snatches the ibuprofen up  and literally snarls  oh fuck off  and storms off  The daughter actually gave me a very apologetic look as they walked away which softened the blow a bit  I wish I dealt with it differently now but I was younger and less confident  oh well  Anyway I know its not the wildest customer story but I thought some of you would enjoy,3277,636
596,jagwr4,1,6,Cancel your wedding    wait what So a while ago I posted a post about what happened to me when I got back from my honeymoon at Country Store T  In that post I had dropped a line about being asked to cancel my wedding so I could work  I had such an overwhelming positive response to share that story I thought that I would So I had gotten hired at Country Story T about a month before my wedding  I agreed to work there with my new employer knowing that I was going to be taking  days off in the middle of July for my wedding and honeymoon  I put in for those days the day I was hired  I made sure that the boss was aware  Written proof that I needed off with him signing it  I reminded him  weeks before my wedding  I actually reminded him the day of my bridal shower  which the day of my shower he refused to let me off at the agreed time of  hours early so that I could get ready  Instead  he wouldn’t let me off until my designated time  Needless to say I was an hour late to my own shower  Anyway  the week before my wedding the schedule comes out and wouldn’t you know it I am scheduled for not only the day of my rehearsal and bachelorette shower  but also the day of my own wedding  Reasoning my boss gave me was because someone else who worked there needed it off for her shotgun wedding  Not kidding you  thats what he said  And the only reason I had to work was seniority  I was pissed  But per his request I got other people to cover my shifts and I was on my way   or so I thought  The day of my wedding rolls around and I get a call from management  The floor manager was calling because my replacement had called in sick and they were begging me to come in  I politely told them that I was getting married that afternoon and to not bother me  The manager gets angry with me stating the boss had said that if anyone of my people calls in that it was then my responsibility to come in to work  I told the floor manager that it was the boss’s oversight not planning better and hung up  Not more than  minutes later my boss is blowing up my phone  I finally answered after  missed calls  Boss man was furious  Yelling and cussing up a storm  telling me that I had to cancel my wedding and come in or else be fired  Little did he know that I had kept the paperwork I had him sign to say that it was ok for me to have those  days off  I sent him a copy of the paperwork  His tune changed in a hurry once I said that I had it in writing and I was not afraid to call corporate  His last words to me on that call was something to the tune of that he would work it and to enjoy my special day  A little late now you jerk  because of the added stress he had caused I had a migraine and remember nothing of my wedding or most of my honeymoon  I was sick for  days with a migraine  How I look at it is that that boss stole away from me the memories of dancing with my dad  brother  and my sweet husband  Those are memories that I will never be able to get back,2981,598

598,j9k72t,1,8,I was just trying to get him to finish the process It was the holiday time  which obviously means all the customers are at their best  I was on register and an older gentleman and his wife approach me  The wife ended up leaving after her husband put his items on the counter and tells me that hes going to sign up for my stores credit card program  After ringing up his items and beginning the credit process  I instruct him to the pin pad where hed have to enter his social security number  When I tell him this  he begins to ask me why he needs to enter it because  youre not supposed to give that number to anybody   I tried to tell him it that he was signing up for a CREDIT CARD  but he wouldnt listen  He looks over to one of my coworkers  whose register is diagonal to mine  and asks if hes Mexican  he isnt   I simply say  no he isnt   This man then says something along the lines of my coworker seeing his ss  and giving it to one of his  buddies   I couldnt wrap my head around what this man was trying to tell me  I tried to assure him that my co worker   couldnt see what he was entering and    was busy doing his job  Finally  he enters in his number and we can finish the credit application process  TL DR  customer thinks my co worker is going to steal his social security number and give it to someone else,1338,257

601,j8af7l,1,13,Trying to return year old worn shoes Worked at a major department store at the returns desk  One time  I had a lady come up to me with a pair of clearly worn boots  And I mean worn  like the color and soles had taken a major beating  She’s insisting she bought them here and wanted to exchange them for the same boots but in a different color  I go to scan the boot and lo and behold  the style isn’t in our system  Now I also worked in the shoe department and knew all the boots that we had by heart  I thought the boot looked similar to what we had but was definitely not the same  different style name  a color I had never seen that boot in   At that moment  as I was trying to figure out where the boot had come from  I noticed that they smelled  No way I was going to let her get away with returning them in that condition  even if I could figure out what they were  But I’m not a confrontational person and this lady was already getting a bit too intense for me   I also had a line starting to form  So I made up some excuse about needing the manager since the boots weren’t coming up in the system correctly and told her to go see if she could even find the boots she claimed she knew we had in the color and size she needed  I call a manager up and start helping the next customer  Lucky for me but not so much this lady  the strictest manager comes over  I’m thinking that there’s no way she’s buying this customer’s bs  The costumer comes back with another pair of boots  I take one look at them and suddenly realize what’s happening  The lady was trying to return last year’s style  The company had basically recreated the same boot with some detail changes and a name change for the new season  I explain this to both the lady and manager once I finish helping the other customer  The lady argues that they still count as the same shoe because they look similar and argues she should get an even exchange regardless  The manager makes a point of saying that she doesn’t want to touch the boots this lady’s trying to return because she can tell they’ve been worn but then does something that I couldn’t believe    The manager offered to give the lady   for them to use towards the other pair  That might not seem like a lot  but it’s a lot more generous than I would have been considering the age and shape of these things  I especially didn’t expect this from that manager  she never let anything slide  I’m sitting there in absolute shock that she’s even taking this lady seriously  I’m also thinking “oh man  this lady really lucked out ” But she didn’t feel the same way  Lady is flabbergasted that she isn’t getting the new pair of boots for nothing  After going back and forth with my manager for awhile the lady slides the shoes across the counter at us and exclaims “Well you might as well donate them then  I’m not going to wear them and I don’t want   for them” and she storms off  I was like “first of all  you’ve already worn them  Second    is better than nothing so why wouldn’t you at least take that  And third  these aren’t getting donated  They’re gross    They’re going to be thrown away  Might as well take the   for giving away your old shoes ”,3198,602
602,j89k7q,1,64,A cashier witnesses true love I’m a cashier at a store at a ski resort  We have both groceries  little trinkets  souvenirs and stuffed animals  Last year  I witnessed a young man  maybe in his twenties  looking intently at our stuffed animals  He picked them up gently and squeezed them  He was so focused on his decision  As a stuffed animal enthusiast I totally understood  There is a “cuteness factor” a “realistic” factor and most importantly  the “cuddle” factor  After a few minutes  I informed him that there were some other stuffed animals in the store he might want to check out  He said “My girlfriend really likes stuffed animals and we have them all in our bed  I know really immature right ” “Oh no  Not at all ” I said  as I also have a ton of stuffed animals in my bed  “I was looking to add a little diversity maybe  We have some bears and an elephant but I was looking for something a little different” he continued  He did look at some other stuffed animals  holding two at a time comparing them against each other  I was able to ring up a few people and go out back to do some chores before he decided  He picked out a bear which I think was the right decision  It meant he knew what she wanted  I was having a tough day and this put a smile on my face  I really appreciate the effort and care he put into picking out that stuffed bear  It was so sweet  I wish she could have seen the determination on his face when he picked up each little stuffed animal  Hopefully this story makes you smile too,1527,285

604,j7ojtk,1,22,A Wholesome Speakerphone Story Hello  New to Reddit so please forgive me if my formatting and or lingo  etc is off    Please dont use this post elsewhere   My first post college retail job was for a cellphone company owned store in a mall  It was basically a long counter on a corner of two hallways  with two closets  one as an office for the manager  and one as my inventory room  I have tons of stories about this job but I thought Id start with a wholesome one to get my feet wet in the Reddit world   On to the tale   Despite being the inventory  manager   in pay but not title  Another story  for another time   I was also customer service  billing inquiries and chief bottle washer  So when I had a slow inventory day I would help out if there was a crowd  Two ladies  probably in their late s had a gentleman with them who was significantly older  They explained he was their father  and he was deaf as a post  but they wanted him to have a phone for emergencies  and so they could be in touch more often  The issue was  they werent sure anything we carried would be loud enough   I knew my inventory backwards and forwards so I picked out the phones with the best audio and we went through them  I would activate one  give it a test call from down the hallway in the mall and hed put it to his ear  Thumbs up meant he could hear me  thumbs down meant he couldnt   All three were thumbs down  Okay next  Tried the ones with the best speaker phones  Thumbs down each time   We went through every phone I had  His daughters were disappointed  but appreciative that I tried  I  however  was not about to give up   Last ditch effort  I grabbed a cheap Motorola that wed already tested and ran into my inventory room  In my  old accessories that well probably never sell  box  I pulled out a small  semi spherical attachment  It was supposed to be used so you could put your phone on the conference table and have a conference call with a bunch of folks   I stuck it in and told him to hold the phone upside down  He looked at me like I was nuts  He put it to his ear and I walked down the hall  I made the call  he answered and I said   can you hear me  Sir    A miracle  His head jerked away from the phone as the volume was definitely in his range  He lit up  his daughters lit up  They rushed down to me and talked to him on the phone to see how it sounded and he talked back  They had a brief conversation and I came back to the counter  The man was in tears he was so happy  and I got a bit choked up myself    I didnt often get to say   I made someones life better today   back then  but that was a good day to be at work   Thanks for reading,2698,525
605,j7j3dg,1,32,It’s a Hard Ops Life    You Ordered How Much  Hello TFR  I’ve got a few great stories to share that are a little different from the usual “Weirdo Customer” or “Terrible Manager” ones  I have stories from  the back room   The stock room receiving whatever else you’d call it First  some background context  I’ve been in retail for  ish years  with my current company  Big Office Supply Chain  for   and have recently been promoted from Tech Sales Associate to Inventory Ops Specialist  Comes with managerial responsibilities and authority  My predecessor was  for lack of a politer way to say it  incompetent Within the first month of my new position  my store manager calls me back to his office to reach me how to place orders for specific stock from the warehouse that they’re either hoarding or not sending as much as we could be selling  We have a brief conversation about one of my predecessor’s numerous fuckups  gt  SM  So  you input the item number and the quantity  Just consider what the item is when deciding the quantity  I showed  Predecessor  this and ordered  of something small as an example  and they ordered  for everything thinking that was just  the  number  gt  Me  And that’s how we wound up with so much of that one toner  the phones  and the trackball mice that we’re just now    months later  getting rid of  Got it So  we order that week and things go well  May have accidentally ordered  too many of a keyboard  but it’s just one item  and they sold pretty quick  But fast forward  weeks   I’m receiving truck  and get told it’ll be  pallets  our usual high end for delivery is     What could it be  So I look through the orders    SM ordered   off brand alcohol wipes   and a half of the  pallets  are the boxes of these wipes  So I head to his office as he gets in  gt  Me  You ordered     how many  of those wipes  gt  SM     But the warehouse never sends all of it when you ask for that much  gt  Me  Well  they did and they are    on the truck today We go back and forth for a bit before I pull up the expected delivery manifest and show him the item with K in the quantity  He assured me it’ll sell fast and it won’t be an issue  Fast forward again   It’s been  a month  give or take a week  We still have  full pallets of these damn wipes sitting in the stock room  with  pallets worth out on the floor in stacked display to try and sell them  They’re not Clorox  or our brand which is packaged similarly and get confused for Clorox  though  So most people pass right by So  the major lesson I learned about ordering stock  order only what the store can reasonably sell  Even if they don’t give you everything you ask for  you don’t clog receiving for a month,2753,492
606,j72r5d,1,25,Never trust a man named The Puffin Around a decade ago  after my first summer in college  I took a job in a now defunct bookstore chain  It was one of the more interesting jobs I have ever had  Like most corporate bookstores  our treatment depended on how many membership cards we could sell per shift  Being in a torust heavy area  not many people wanted membership in a regional bookstore  Despite the headaches thos caused  we did have a handful of local characters who frequented the store  one of whom was a man who called himself The Puffin  The man clearly had issues but he was generally friendly enough and we usually let him hang out in the store and read  Of all my coworkers  I got along the most with the assistant manager who had taken le under his wing  The assistant manager did not care for The Puffin and considered him a loiterer  One evening when we were getting ready to close up shop  the assistant went to wake The Puffin so hed leave  The Puffin proceeded to let out a royal squawk and proceeded to punch my boss in the face  He proceeded to rocket around the store and knocked over some shelves  The assistant manager  sporting a bloody nose began yelling at me to call the cops  The cops finally arrived and were able to apprehend The Puffin  who was cackling like a maniac when he was led out  The assistant manager began to chew me out for not going after The Puffin  Assistant boss man had such a dry sense of humor that to this day Im still not sure if he was really mad at me for not intervening   At that point in my life I weighed maybe a buck twenty five soaking wet and The Puffin had a good foot on me so I was not planning on brawling in the bookstore   On one of my last shifts before summer ended  I see a man enter the store and shout  Im back bitches    The next thing I hear from assistant bossman is  Thatparkerluck  call the bleeping cops now   After hanging up my bookstore apron and going back to school  I didnt think much of The Puffin until I took some shifts at the bookstore when I was home for winter break  At one point  I was in the back office and noticed an obituary on the wall  It was for The Puffin  Assistant bossman said that the bookstore staff were some of the only people at the funeral aside from the minister who helped bury the homeless  Assistant bossman gave the eulogy  Of anyone I have ever met in my years of retail  I will never forget The Puffin,2432,457

608,j6rfvt,1,123,I do work her but I’m not working right now  I’m on mobile and please don’t use my story anywhere else  I worked women’s clothing retail for years  I walked into the store I managed about ten minutes before my shift one day  I get two steps into the store when I get stopped by a customer  Now granted I have my sunglasses on and I’m carrying my purse  lunch bag and my binder that I keep my schedule in  Clearly you can tell I just got there and in no way  shape  or form am I working yet  This lady starts going on and on about how we don’t have what she wants  I look at her over the top of my sunglasses and tell her “ma’am if you would be so kind as to go to the register and let my employees know what you’re looking for they will be able to help you  I just got here and I haven’t even clocked in yet ” She tells me I’m rude and not very customer friendly  I get to the registers and I tell my girls to go help the woman up front find some stuff and get her a dressing room started  One of the girls comes to the back room where I’m getting settled for the day and says “this lady is PISSED at you  She says you’re the rudest person she’s ever seen and wants to talk to the store manager ” I tell my employee to have the manager on duty handle it as I’m not on the clock yet and I need to handle some personal stuff before I clock in  My assistant talks to the lady apologized and tried to explain to her that I had just walked in and was clocked in for my shift and that I was polite about letting her know that I wasn’t on the clock yet  Meanwhile I’m in the back on the phone with my dm and I run out to clock in real fast and go back to the back  I finish up my phone call with my dm and I go out on the floor  The lady walks up to me and says “I want you to know I didn’t appreciate the attitude from you when I asked you if you had something  I apologized and said “ma’am I had just walked in to come to work  I had on my sunglasses  purse  lunch bag and I was not clocked in  There were two other people working at the time and you could have asked them  For all you knew I could have been a shopper just like you  Now that I’m here and ready to work if there is anything else I can help you with please let me know”  She stayed away from me the rest of the time she shopped  We got a call three days later from my dm because she wrote in to corporate complaining about me  The regional and territorial managers both wanted to know what happened because this was unlike me to “be this rude to someone”  My dm told them the story and said she would call the lady and talk with her  The lady wanted me fired and my dm flat refused  She said I’m not firing one of my best managers that have been with me for years because you felt she was rude when you tried to ask her questions when she wasn’t on the clock  That manager pours her heart and soul into that store to keep it running and treats every single person that walks through her doors the same and is welcoming to everyone  The fact that you failed to listen to her when she told you she wasn’t clocked in and to go to her employees who were clocked in tells me you aren’t very considerate  How would you like to be stopped and asked questions before you were able to clock in for your shift  You wouldn’t because you wouldn’t be getting paid for that  Well same thing here  She’s not allowed to work off the clock and did the right thing by directing you to someone who could help you ” The lady wasn’t happy about this and ended hanging up on my dm  Dm wasn’t too worried about it because the woman was in the wrong and the regional and territorial managers understood,3648,735
609,j6qo59,1,78,Woman admitted to ruining her own shoes and wanted a refund I work at a major chain shoe store  A few days ago a woman walked in with a pair of shoes she was looking to return  No box  no receipt  Normally this is an immediate no but we will take one if it is clearly a manufacturer defect  She takes the shoes out of her bag and explains that she put them in the washing machine and now theyre ruined  The shoes were shrunken and malformed and the memory foam soles were all messed up  I said   maam  we cant take a return for this  These are not washable shoes    I put all my shoes in the washing machine  though  Why did these get ruined   Probably because theyre not a machine washable material  We sell shoes that you can put in the washing machine and they have a sticker on the box that says so    Well then how am I supposed to wash these shoes then  I was baffled because most types of shoes are not washing machine safe   The same way you clean most shoes  Cleaning solution and a towel   It was very obvious that these were a type of shoes that could not go in a washing machine but the woman would not leave  She started making up problems with the shoes and kept insisting on a return  Eventually I gave up and left to grab my manager to shut the lady up  When I returned to the counter  the woman was complaining to my coworker about her ruined shoes in a desperate attempt to get a refund  In all  it probably took  minutes to get it into this daft womans head that she ruined our shoes and it wasnt our fault  I have SO many stories about morons at this job and this is just one that sticks out in my memory,1651,314

611,j6op4b,1,14,The bag was almost as tall as her So I used to work at a rather large FL clothing store as a  jack of all trades   Basically I did everything from shipping  go backs  register  fitting rooms   etc  Our loss prevention officer was NEVER around  to the point that to save his job he would be willing to fire employees for BS reasons to save face  As a result of this my bosses made whoever was on the sales floor do LPs job until they realized that I was the best at it and made ME LP whenever there was someone actively stealing  Ive dealt with a lot of really crazy customers who were actively stealing as a result  some of which were obviously completely intoxicated from drugs or alcohol or would even have the stolen products visible in their handbags   So onto the story  I was working saturday night and this young couple who were pretending not to know each other were VERY obviously stealing  I was put in charge of watching them so for over an hour I had to hang outside the fitting rooms just watching them  going through anything they would put onto the return rack for evidence  I would never watch people like this normally however they were being blatantly obvious  Big cart filled with multiples of the same items in random sizes and yes they really were in there for over an hour  They had no idea I was watching them since I was pretending to work in that section on the tables however whenever I asked if they needed any help the woman would look nervous but try to hide it  As I searched the clothing they put back I found around   worth in ripped off tags that they tried to hide as well as hangers clipped to a shirts interior or doubled up on the same item   As I am watching them out of nowhere I saw this HUGE teal rectangular bag floating and moving in the aisle  for a second I thought that I mustve been losing my mind so I did a double take and it was this tiny  middle aged woman and the bag was almost as tall as she was  The bag was FILLED to the brim and I just knew it couldnt be anything good however since I was stuck watching the couple still I called my manager over the walkie  When I did that she was initially annoyed and dismissive  She ignored me for over  minutes as I was trying to watch all  active steales until she finally responded  When I told her about the lady she flipped out  she dropped anything and everything she was doing and immediately went to me  She asked me where she was and so I pointed at her  My manager couldnt see her over the aisles but then saw her monsterous teal bag  She went up to the lady   said  things and then confiscated her bag  THE BAG WASNT EVEN HERS  SHE STOLE THE BAG FROM OUR STORE AND IT WAS FILLED WITH STOLEN ITEMS  She left very quickly after to avoid being arrested however this lady tried to steal    worth in products  She EVEN took ALL of the products out of their boxes to fill the bag up as much as possible  Later on that night after the couple left with their stolen goods   not allowed to confront them for legal reasons  we found a cart FILLED with empty boxes and tags  they were ALL from the woman we confiscated the bag from  It was honestly too crazy however I never saw her again and I got a HUGE reward for catching her in the act before she could walk out of the store  I now finally understand the saying that you cant have your cake and eat it too  TLDR  small  woman tried to steal    on products with bag almost as tall as she was that she stole from our store  Also throwaway becuase Im too busy with life to respond,3565,685
612,j6gtdd,1,2,Customer wanted to return something they no longer had I work for one of the largest chain auto repair companies  They consider them selves retail   the word retail is literally in the name of our Parent company  BSRO  Bridgestone Retail Operations  We have a policy of  day buy and try with tires  If you get a tire that we sell  dont like it for what ever legit reason you can get another similar tire for the cost difference  Ex  if you get a   set of tires on your luxury car and they ride rough you could upgrade to a better   set and pay the   difference  The ones we take off are marked and sent back to the company  they arent re sold Today we had a customer call up  I put a set of Destination XTs on his truck  They are a newer tire  Anything like this is special order to begin with Its Mud terrain that are less aggressive than the standard M T  Guy wants to use the  day buy and try  He totaled his truck yesterday and its a total loss wants to use the policy to get his money back  Boss has to explain to him several different ways that its just to upgrade to something else  He would have to bring his truck in thats totaled  and we could install a different set of tires on it but we dont just hand you money because you totaled it days after buying special order mud tires,1312,250
613,j6gbbp,1,10,Thanks  but no thanks Im a manager at a mom and pop store that sells just about everything you can think of  so were well known in the neighborhood Earlier today Im walking from the back of the store towards the register and as I get closer I hear my cashier say  youll need to talk to the manager about that   Oh boy  here we go     So since I overheard  I stepped up and realized that this man walked right up next to a lady who was having her basket full of items rung up  and just rudely interrupted  Heres how the conversation went Me  What can I do for you Him  Im moving and I had these cassette tapes that I wanted to donate Me   confused because I wasnt sure I heard right  Cassette tapes Him  Yeah  the ones that play on a reel   I may be paraphrasing here He holds them out and I just looked at the boxes and then back at him Me  Oh  we dont have a cassette player Him   Well I meant for your customers Me   stares I honestly didnt know how to react  Theres nothing about our store to suggest that our customers want used cassette tapes  Our customers drive luxury cars and pay   for a single dish towel  He ended up making a strange noise and walking out the door before I could say anything else,1241,227
614,j6g5g1,1,3,Hose Mad  So because people wash their cars  auto parts stores sell hose attachments  One particular older man came into my store awhile back and bought  amongst other things  one of those multi use hose nozzles with the rotating face  I remember noting as one of us rang up his purchase  that Id never seen anyone buy one off us He was back about an hour later  and he wasnt happy  Apparently it squirted water on him off the side of the dial and he had the wet spot on his sweatshirt to prove it  He wanted another one  I was happy to oblige  but the classic trope arises He had no receipt Fortunately we had a non receipt return option  and having remembered him from earlier I was still willing to do this for him  but the computer systems next request proved problematic in this case  the computer scans a barcode on the back of a drivers license  presumably to better ID someone if theyre returning a stolen good  The man doesnt have his ID  He walked to our store and with his age he wasnt in the mood to walk laps to deal with an item that was well under  dollars  So understandably frustrated  he opted to buy a different hose attachment we had that looked less cheap  and when I asked what he wanted to do about the broken one  he told me to keep it   It was in fact broken  and further broke itself falling off a table  The part of this story thats always stuck with me was as this reasonably frustrated old man was getting cashed out by me I hand him his stuff and reflexively tell him to  have a nice day   I dont remember what he quipped back with first  but because my wit is as sharp as a bowling ball I just stood there awkwardly  To which he looked me dead in the eye and said  I just got HOSED   he turned around  and walked out of the store TLDR  puns dont help with your ho se problems  And dont treat your receipts as a wash  Unless you got plenty of cash to sprinkle around,1920,358
615,j6f1f1,1,3,Which One  Ill try to keep this as curt and not strange as possible  So  Ive completed to interviews and received job offers  One is a front desk position  and the other is a  sales associate position at a popular thrift store  Ive been trying to get a clerical receptionist position for the longest time  and Im super excited and blessed to have received these offers  However  Im kind of stuck  So  both jobs pay the same amount  The front desk position is the base plus a commission and yearly bonus  BUT at the clothing store  the manager has offered to make me a supervisor after two months  the original supervisor somehow circumvented the rules so that we have to wait until the system automatically terminates her before anyone else can fill the role   I really need the clerical experience of the front desk position  but the supervisor position could help me as well and I would not have to wait too long to receive it My main concern is that by the time Im supposed to become a supervisor the manager will rescind the offer of become vague and hesitate to give me the offer  I have no way of verifying whether or not shes truthful or just trying to say anything to have me join her staff  Any and all advice is appreciated just please be kind  Much love,1284,231
616,j6bf09,1,3,Follow that Spoderman  Hello  This is a follow up post from last month  Im on mobile  so please excuse the formatting This happened a week after the first sighting when I almost crashed into the kid spiderman and his companion at work  This time I was on my way back to my department from bakery deli  which is across the store  as I finished my shopping run and was going to stage what I had and grab another run I reached the end of the frozen section when—pop — a smol spoderman bursted out of one of the frozen isles right in front of my cart He looked at me I looked at him And he looked at me And I looked at him And then he ran off towards the pet isle and took a hard left into them  I kinda just continued my way  walking the same path since my department was in that direction  I took the left and the kid was  Just   standing there  At the other end of the isle  I continued walking trying not to laugh because this kid was just too darn adorable  After I got about halfway down the isle he turned and ran off  After a second I turned the corner and saw this kid turn again  like he was  expecting  me  and dashed off like he was naruto I havent seen this kid since then and I wouldnt be angry if I did  This was the best experience at work Ive had my entire life,1297,245
617,j5yq72,1,62,Dont Stand So Close to Me     no  u  Alright  so about two or three Saturdays ago  I was working a rare morning shift  and it was about an hour before I was due to go home  I was moving the line along until this guy came up to my till  He was a man that looked to be about in his s or s  I was just about to scan his things when he made this noise that sounded like  ANH ANH   I thought he was jerking me around  but when I reached out my hand again to pick up one of his things to scan it  he was about close to losing it  gt  Old man  I said  dont touch that  ILL hold it  and YOU scan it with your scanner gun  Okay  whatever   I thought to myself  But I understood that when there are times like these  its sort of understandable that youd be afraid of catching anything just by picking up something that you dont even trust anyone   not even the person bagging your groceries  Things were going okay until he noticed another customer standing behind him  and thats where he absolutely loses it  gt  Old man  EXCUSE ME  MISS  YOURE SUPPOSED TO STAND SIX FEET AWAY See  this is a lady thats a regular in our store  Shes normally very nice and easy to talk to  but she was ready to lay into him  However  she kept her cool just fine as she said this  gt  Nice lady  Actually  Im standing where Im supposed to be  What are YOU doing Yup   he was actually standing too close to HER as she was standing on the red line on the floor  and had the audacity to accuse her of standing too close to him  And then he made the grand mistake of saying this to her  gt  Old man  Huh  Somebody oughta teach you MILLENIALS about manners  When I say youre standing too close  YOURE STANDING TOO CLOSE Ohhhhh  she BLEW  UP  She looked at him with the meanest sneer on her face and just cussed him out  He ignored her like she was nothing and paid for his stuff  and then managed to forcefully drop his stuff into his bag and left all huffy  I wanted to say something to him so bad  but my manager was right there seeing the whole thing go down  and I didnt wanna barge into the argument between these two customers  After he left  or at least thats what I thought he did  Ill get to that in a minute   I apologized profusely to the woman and we got to talking  She just shook her head and chuckled  gt  Nice lady  Man  this stuffs going arounds bringing out all kinds of crazy people As she said this  we both noticed the old man outside  starting a brand new argument with a couple of people trying to walk inside our store  He was full on screaming at them  and they were shouting back at him before they decided it was no use and made a run for it before he did anything worse  After that  he was seen no more  Main takeaway is  dont accuse someone of standing too close to you when YOU are not standing where youre supposed to be,2869,535
618,j5mnfr,1,31,They moved the item I promise So heres a story of a wild Karen when I worked at a retail farm store  I had just gotten back from my honeymoon and they had rearranged the store  This is important for later  A family walks in the dad and daughter are nice but the mom is a mega Karen  I ask them if they need help finding something and they said they had a coupon for pool salt  I directed them to the back of the store where the salt used to be  I then went back to my checklist of things I had to do  I couldnt necessarily check on them all the time because I couldnt leave the front of the store  The family came back up said they couldnt find it  Complained about it being on the website and not in the store and left  Literally  minutes later the Karen comes back into the store shouting at me  Saying that we had it but it was outside  So I walk outside take a picture of the SKU and head back inside  Upon walking back inside Karen goes off on me saying that was a liar  She got in my face and now its been a while but it went something like this  Karen  You are a lazy worthless employee  You couldnt even be bothered to help us Me  Well you didnt really ask Karen  Yes we did you liar  You just refused  I have it on fucking video  she didnt by the way  you refusing  You wasted our time  Me  Im not allowed to go to the back a follow people around  I have to watch the front Karen  You mother fucking liar  Me  Excuse    Karen   gasp  Who the hell do you think you fucking are to interrupt me like that  You are a fucking waste of space and breath do us all a favor and kill yourself  I am calling your boss and will be getting FIIIRRREEEEDDD   Growling that last part Then she walked out the door flipping me off  I was bawling at the end of this  However   she was in plain view of the security camera when all this happened lol  Nothing ever came of this but I quit  weeks later because my full time job at the school started back up  I wish i had said more but I was shocked and trying to keep it together and be nice to the customer  Looking back I wish I would have fired back at her  However I do know my worth and she was a big reason why I walked away from a company who does not protect their employees from customers like this  The company is so hyper focused on pleasing the customer that their employees get shoved aside  I have tons of stories illustrating this but Ill save them for other subreddits like the time I was asked to cancel my wedding so I could work  Lol,2511,491
619,j5cslb,1,15,Reusable bag exchange This will probably be a really short post but I found it rather ridiculous so I figured I’d post it  I was cashing out this one woman  asked her if she wanted bags and she said no she had her own  Cool  I continued to cash her out  As she was pulling out her bags she noticed one of the straps was broken  She asked if she could trade it in for a reusable bag from our store  even though her broken bag was from a competitor  As if we do that with our own reusable bags   I honestly was so flabbergasted I didn’t know how to react  Pretty sure I may have been slightly rude when I told her no  but seriously  Who asks that  I offered her a plastic bag but she got annoyed  insisted on using her broken bag while also trying to make me feel bad for not giving her a free reusable bag    I didn’t care  finished cashing out her groceries and called the next customer,889,175

626,j3ghj5,1,35,Knife Sharpening  While in my last year of college  I used to work for a very well known outdoor store  Said outdoor store had a knife shop which was a small section of the main store that only sold knives and stuff that went with them  I was covering in the knife shop because we had a guy that worked exclusively back there and he was on break  There were no customers in the shop  and on the display rack was a  in  knife sharpener that was out of the packaging and available to use for anyone  I had a small pocketknife with me to open boxes with during night stocking  so i pulled it out and used the sharpener to sharpen the blade  Out of nowhere I hear “Gimme that damn thing ” I look up startled and a man in his mid ’s plucks the knife and sharpener from my hands and says “you damn kids have no idea how to do anything don’t ya ” He takes my knife and the sharpener and begins to lecture me on how to sharpen the knife properly  All the while his wife is standing next to him  and instead of being mortified by her husband’s behavior  she simply says “he really likes his knives  Knows everything about them ” I’m too shocked to say anything  and he hands me my knife back  much sharper than before  He and his wife leave the little shop to go into the rest of the store  no doubt thinking they had done me a huge favor and taught me a lesson as well,1368,269
627,j3ff8g,1,10,I learned big words and dont know what they mean  Good morning all  On mobile so if there is anything formatting issues let me know Context  I work in the paint department of a hardware store It was a nice slow morning today and I got a call from a gal   May I note this wasnt a Karen and simply someone who didnt know what they were talking about   She is looking for oil based gloss epoxy paint in our Rust o leum brand  Now for those of you who dont know epoxy isnt a paint its a two part compound you combine usually to adhere things together or seal holes  I tell her Ill check then look over what we have and pinpoint enamel paint  I think to myself she might have gotten epoxy and enamel confused so I return to the call Me   Hi again  so I dont have the epoxy you were looking for but I do have clear coat enamel spray paint from that brand will that work  Gal   Well I need epoxy     is it oil based  Me   Yup it sure is Gal   Okay  let me get your name and Ill call back after I talk to the guy  Me   Sure thing my name is  redacted  just ask for me when you call     She hangs up and I look over our shelves to find that we only have one can of this clear gloss spray paint so I set it aside and wait for her to call  After about  mins they page for me to pick up line one and Im certain its the lady hoping she doesnt need too many Me   Hello thank you for holding how can I help you  Gal   Hi again I called earlier about the epoxy paint  I need a gallon and would you be able to set it aside for me to pick up  Me  Unfortunately I only have one spray can of it left and we dont sell it in gallons  May I ask what youre using it for because we may have another product you can use  Gal   Well its for WOOD flooring and we want to put a protective coating over it  Me    Oh well I do have polyurethane thats good for going over bare or stained wood that come in gallons sizes and we do offer oil based its from the Varathane brand would that work  Gal   Let me check   she calls out to someone and talks with them while I wait   Actually that wont work because they said thats for wood and we have outdoor concrete we need to go over   She literally we just telling me it was for wood but now its for concrete   Heck  Me   Well Ive got Drylok brand concrete floor coatings that come in clear that should work  Gal   I picked up something like that from your store not long ago and I was told by the guys that it wont work because its water based and that will mess up the oil based protection coating we have on it already   So she has a protective coating on it already and wants another what the Heck     Me   if you give me just a moment I can check if we have anything oil based thats for concrete  Ill be right back   I check and sadly its all oil based so I return to the call Me   Howdy  thanks for waiting  Unfortunately all of our concrete floor coatings will be water based Gal   Oh shoot well thanks for checking  We really need oil epoxy paint so Ill try checking around some other places  Me   Alright best of luck  Have a good day   click It seemed like whoever told her what they needed either didnt know what they were doing or she misunderstood  She wasnt mean or anything but it was so weird that she couldnt seem to keep her story straight for what she was trying to do or what she needed  I hope she locates what she is looking for or learns the proper names for the items she is trying to find Tldr  Nice lady is looking for an epoxy paint which doesnt exsist and cant seem to stick with what story she has for what its going on  In the end the confused lady decides to search elsewhere,3707,695
628,j3c1ro,1,43,Sir  you have to wait here Back in the s while in college  I worked in a small store of a large nationwide grocery chain part time to help pay for books  extra food snacks  etc  Back then  many grocery stores had video departments  I worked in the non foods department  where we also manned the video counter  the lottery machine  and had a register  couldnt sell anything sold by weight like produce  as there was no scale   You can imagine how busy Saturday nights would get with folks wanting to rent videos and other folks wanting lottery tickets  One such Saturday night in January around    this older gentleman came through with a paper lunch sack  Old man  Here  Heres my money  heres my list  Im going to walk around the store and when I come back I want my lottery tickets  He took off  I looked in the sack  and there was about   in cash  and  pages on lined notebook paper full of   digit lottery numbers  all arranged in different groups whether he wanted them boxed  smaller prize   straight  number order has to be exact  or some other way  I looked at my co worker  who shrugged and began helping the next person in line who wanted to rent a video  Over the next  minutes  I kept entering lottery numbers on the machine just for this one guy  who was no where near the counter  A lady came up and wanted to order lottery tickets as well  and I explained what I was doing and that there was going to be a wait  She became upset  rightfully so   and went to drag a manager over  who told me to stop what I was doing and help the lady in front of me  since the gentleman was not there  So  I did  And the next person  and the next person  because the manager was standing a few feet away  watching me  At    the gentleman returned and was livid because I didnt have his tickets completed  He told me he was going to walk around some more and that I had better have them ready in  minutes when he returned  regardless of the fact that we had  lines  deep  I asked him to stay there  and he refused  Other customers became angry  so I started helping them  The next  told me that guy had some nerve  and that they were going to complain to the manager about him  Next thing I know  the  minutes have passed and the guys list still isnt done  its been over an hour since he brought it to me   He became upset  started yelling at me  saying that I was messing with his money and that if he didnt win because the ticket wasnt finished he was going to sue  He left and dragged a manager back over  its  at this point  and the machine would automatically stop allowing any more tickets to be purchased at that point because the drawings would begin  minutes later   complaining that I didnt finish up his tickets  Mind  this is a different manager than before  and of course  the manager took his side  saying that since he was there first  I should have completed his order before starting on anyone elses  Once the gentleman left  and the line disappeared  the manager pulled me upstairs to the office to give me a talking to  The first manager was up there  and heard the second one telling me I was getting written up  and he interjected  He told the second manager what really happened  and told him that the guy kept leaving and refusing to stay in line so I could work on his list  He also informed him that several other customers had come to him to complain about that guy  and that this wasnt the first time he had done it  and therefore I wasnt to be punished  From then on  it was decided that if the gentleman came back to pull the same stunt  that I and my coworkers had to tell him he either needed to stay right there  or there would be no guarantee his numbers would be input completely and on time  He could also come in on other days of the week to play his numbers for Saturday  Wouldnt you know it  but the next Saturday he shows up at  with another   worth of lists of numbers to play  He tried leaving  and I told him that he needed to stay right there where he was if he wanted those numbers  or he would have to explain to the  other people in line behind him why they couldnt play their numbers as well  He tried to protest  and I offered to get a manager  He backed down and I worked his numbers  This time  the line of customers behind him were mad at him instead of me  and rightfully so    From then on  he started coming in earlier in the afternoon  and stayed there to have a conversation with me while I input his numbers  Ended up being a cool guy  but terribly clueless that others also wanted to play,4616,867
629,j38mfw,1,0,Just   No  Ive worked nearly  years in retail customer service roles  I have several doozies  but heres one that still makes me feel self conscious when Im at my part time job I work at a nationwide grocery store  it has different names  depending on what region of the country   in one of the larger types of stores they have  At the time of this incident  the union contract wouldnt allow non grocery workers to work in the grocery dept  and vice versa  I was covering in the HBA section because they were short on people  and I was facing product  conditioning the shelves  etc  At one point  I was kneeling on the floor  trying to reach the popular lotion that was at the back of the shelf so I could pull it forward when I hear a self satisfied grunt at the other end of the aisle  I look up  and there was this shady looking guy staring at me  He had a slimy grin on his face   So  Youre on your knees  Youre doing a good job over there  Having years of customer service under my belt  I thanked him politely  and he walked away  A few minutes later  I went to another aisle and there he was  also kneeling  examining the shaving cream  I nodded politely and focused on my work   Hey   he said   Were both on our knees  We have something in common  We must both like being on the floor  Hows about I take you out sometime  Trying not to gag  I looked at him   Sir  if you think that is in any way an appropriate way to ask a lady out  Ill have to decline    Aw come on  are you too snooty  I bet youre nasty in bed  I stood up  and walked away  I didnt trust myself to not say anything that would get me fired  was written up years before at a different store for not being polite to a guy who was  just trying to be friendly    I found a store manager  the one guy at the time who took this stuff seriously  to tell him what happened in case a complaint came through  and the manager got upset for me  He asked me if the guy is still in the store  and we looked out the office windows  the office is located upstairs   and the guy was checking out at the registers  Manager looked at me and said if that happened again to report it  because there have been other guys who have tried to prey on  and actually stalked  some of the other gals in the store  and those guys have been banned  That manager has since gone on to a different store  and we have all new  awesome   management that doesnt put up with that kind of nonsense,2467,459

631,j2y2ii,1,8,No  I cant exchange your Destroyed phone To start this off I am a sales rep at a local phone store  Our return policy on all devices only covers software issues that we must be able to replicate  It was a normally slow day at the store  I came in  counted the drawer  updated inventory  and set up my  work station   Laptop  phone charger  and whatever Im reading at the time  in the back when a regular customer comes in  He lets me know his phone wont startup  First of all  it was completely disgusting  covered in dust  some sticky substance  I clean up the phone with  alcohol pads and I went through the troubleshooting processes that I was being recommended from the manufactures to anything our support team or other sales reps could recommend to me  I let me know that since it seems like this issue cant be fixed he might be eligible for a device exchange  I take the case off the phone and it is even more disgusting than I thought  More dust and the case were stuck to the back panel of the phone as if it was glue  I clean it up and give it a decent inspection to see just how the condition of the phone was  It looked fantastic until the dust came off  The entire back of the phone had spiderweb styled cracks on every corner  Afer seeing this I turn to the customer and relay him the situation that is happening in my head  Me  Sir Im sorry but due to the damage on the back of your phone we cannot accept a return or an exchange for the device C  What do you mean  I bought this phone  days ago  Isnt it still in its warranty period Me  Our warranty only covers the software side of the phone  Even though the problem you are having is related to the software we cant accept it due to the damage on the back  C  I know I dropped it a couple of times but I just bought it  cant you talk to a manager or something  Me  One moment  please  I contact the distribution manager and my local store manager though a group chat to see what they think of the situation pictures and all  I made sure all the pictures I took had the brown pads in the back from cleaning the phone beforehand   They were appalled and disgusted that I even ask them about it  They give instant disapproval of the exchange and I let the customer know  Me  Im sorry but I was not able to approve it  would you be interested in getting a new phone today  C  I cant give you any more money  I bought that phone  days ago  cant you give me a credit towards another one or a discount  yes a discount  Ive been a customer for years  Me  If you come into our north location tomorrow you can try again with my manager  Hes the only person who is able to approve any additional credit  discounts  and most importantly a refund or exchange if you truly feel you deserve one  Other than that my hands are currently tied  The customer goes on about how he needs a phone to go to work tomorrow  call his wife and kids  etc  He paces back and forth in our showroom for almost an hour before he finally asks again  I give him the same answer as I have for the past hour  he says some choice words  comes really close to the counter  C  Youre going to regret this laterI was confused so I just say nothing as he storms out the storm  He hits the door with his waist on his way out and knocks a large pocket knife out of his pocket  he picks it up and runs to his car and speeds off almost causing an accident on the nearby intersection  This might have been my wake up call to get out of retail and find a career for myself somewhere else,3551,682

634,j2i2ju,1,95,Customer felt “uncomfortable” because I told her she wasn’t allowed behind the counter So  I work at a fabric store and the other day I had this lady come behind the cut counter  the place we cut fabric for customers   I told her she wasn’t allowed back there and then she was upset and said she was to the side of the counter  Well after that  I cut her fabric and things seemed okay until I cut the last fabric and she told me I made her feel “uncomfortable” earlier  She then went on to tell me that I need to think before I say something lol so then I just told her a apology that it was just the policy  Then she responds by saying she used to work here and she would never treat someone like that lol   after that I just told her “Have a lovely night ” lol  I thought that was gonna be the end of it but she went to find my manager and complained to her about me  Then she made her remeasure the fabric I cut  which was the right measurement btw   Luckily my manager asked for my side of the story and understood where I was coming from but she said that the lady was supposedly a regular  She added that the lady gave some story about how she felt like she was being caught stealing  Idk I was definitely upset about it in the beginning but now I just mostly think it’s weird how deluded she was lol,1310,256
635,j2h3fv,1,52,lady was disgusted with me because we didnt sell motor oil Hello  So I work at a certain red coloured big box store  Basically  today there was this customer who needed help in a totally different department from where I work but nobody was listening to our security dudes walkie requests to help her  so I went over  I went over  and ask if she was doing okay  and she was said  no i am not      and then said  you dont look like you work here  looking me up and down   even though i was in dress code for my work  i was wearing a comfy spiderman shirt and jeans and a name badge of course    I just said  oh Im sorry about that but i do work here  and she said  I guess thats whats acceptable now  and I kinda brushed it off and asked what she needed help finding   and she asked me for motor oil  I responded saying that I had never seen motor oil  but let me look it up on the little device they give us   and started to search for motor oil  She said  Okay  but Ive been waiting a long time for help so Im going to look around  and she went into the next aisle while i searched it on the device   and surprise surprise we didnt sell any motor oil  I went and found her and our exchange went like this   l is for lady  and me is me of course  me  hey  Sorry but it looks like we dont sell motor oil at this location and only other stores will carry this specific type of motor oil  l  What do you mean    Thats ridiculous  How could you not sell motor oil   dont you think thats strange   me  Im sorry about that  but there is a jiffy lube across the street    l  Go away  How dare you say that to me me   starts walking away  alright  have a nice dayl  THIS IS A GROCERY STORE  HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT TO ME  so i just walked away  Still wondering how anything i said was so terrible but oh well,1832,359
636,j2gkng,1,17,Unforeseen Consequences of sanitizing everything all the time So in August  I went to urgent care because my fingers went numb and my hands stopped working   I couldnt hold my phone in my hand for more than  seconds without a weakness developing that I can not describe   Spraying a sanitizer bottle every couple of minutes  every shift  since March destroyed my hands   I am not alone  there are at least  other people working the front end of the grocery store that I am currently employed who have gone to their doctors or urgent care   This is one store  in one of the big grocery chains in North America   This has to be happening all over the place  Repetitive strain from squeezing a sanitizer bottle is the new sitting at a desk all day or smoking or whatever   Have any of you seen or experienced this  I feel like because I do not represent the majority of employees they will happily pay out the claims instead of changing the safety protocols for their employees   I dont know if I CAN USE MY HANDS PROPERLY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE  and nobody in charge seems to be taking it seriously,1103,208

638,j2d9ce,1,7,This place is driving me crazy  I got a job at a gas station again  I worked at one in another state for about  and half years and it was all good  This one gas station pays a little more than min wage and its full time  But now I realise the reason why  It is crazy  They only trained me  days and they gave me the busiest shift  It only has gas and most people there are foreigners and I can barely understand the numbers they say so I keep voiding  Or their English is very poor and they think number three is  in English  Then they throw   in ones to put gas on the pump and leave  dont wait for me to verify it  For the past days I have been short and there are aspects of the register that I dont know  But sadly the training was only those  days I dont know why I was short the previous days  I take the money and count it when I give change  make sure they are not stuck  Just a few times  my coworker didnt let me count the drawer when she closed since there was a huge line of customers  I almost had a breakdown yesterday  I did a mistake with the pumps so that led me short again  I work  days and for  hours I am just on the register and getting a lot of  bills  I cant even go on a  minute break  people are knocking the station window or shout for me to come out  I wanted to share on this board  I was happy that I got a full time job but I am on the verge of crying and being terrified of being short everyday,1453,300
639,j1slhd,1,44,Please dont kill the clams  sir  So I work in the deli section of a supermarket chain  This happened a few weeks ago in the fish section  Now at this store  the fish and deli departments have the same workers and are next to each other  The only difference is that only one person is in the fish department at a time     I was helping out customers when a man comes up to me and I get him some stuff out of the case  We keep the shellfish and some other stuff in a refrigerated self in front of it  with the shellfish in buckets of ice to keep them fresh  Im not aloud to give out ice because we dont have any to give and the stuff in the buckets is for keeping the stuff fresh  So of course he asks me for ice  the exchange goes something like this   me  sorry sir but I cant give you ice for  reasons explained above   Customer this time a little ruder   What do you mean  come just give me ice I see some right there point to buckets   me  Im sorry but again I cant give you ice   customer  this is ridiculous I need to go to  town that is like an hour south   you need to give it to me or I will get a manager    We go back and forth for a bit until he takes the clams he had picked up and threw them into the bucket  I go and check only to find they are cracked  So  at the point  Im hoping he comes back so I can get him to pay for them    And what do you know  He comes back with a grocery manager who doesnt know how things work in the deli  I explain the situation to him and he understands that Im just doing what Im supposed to   I also make sure to mention the broken clams  He just tells the guy if he wants ice that he will need to buy a bag from the store  which is like  cents  and that he will need to take the broken ones  The buy argues with him for a bit and then finally relents and goes to pay    My manger gets back from break  so I tell him what happened and we all had a good laugh about it   As I thought I didnt get in trouble since we pretty much get people like that all day  On the way home I told my brother about it and turns out he went through his line  He of course complained about how we were being ridiculous about ice and all that   I wonder how he would have reacted to him had he know he was my brother,2281,478

642,j1ilck,1,35,Old bizarre story I haven’t been in retail for more than  years but I was recently reminded of one of the more bizarre interactions I when I worked part time at a furniture store  It was the late s and I was working part time in a furniture store on the weekends during college  One day I get a call from a lady who had special ordered a bedroom set  months ago  At the time she was told the order would take  months and wanted to know whether we had her furniture in yet  No problem  I asked for her receipt invoice number but the system didn’t have a record of her order  I asked for her name but the system didn’t have a record of her either  She gets irate  Tells me she has the receipt in her hands and berates me for not understanding simple numbers and how to spell  She finally tells me she wants a full refund and that she’s coming in person to make sure she gets her money back  mins later the woman shows up  She asks for the person she spoke to on the phone and when I come out to help her she yells at me for being incompetent  I’ve got a thick skin and at this point I’m really curious to see what the problem is  so I ask to see her receipt  I look at it and immediately see the problem  she’s at the wrong store  We don’t have a record of her order because she didn’t buy anything from our store  I point this out to her but she refuses to believe me  She’s convinced the store  and me in particular  are trying to steal her money  I point out that the store name on her receipt and the name in front of the store she’s current at isn’t the same  the receipt we issue don’t look anything like hers  and the phone numbers don’t match  She says it’s been  months and we could have gotten new receipts and made changes  The phone number in her receipt doesn’t work anymore and she found our store in the phone book  She trusts the phone book to be right Finally  I ask her to read the address on her receipt and walk her outside to show her the street sign to prove to her we’re not at the same location  Our store wasn’t part of a chain  it only has a single location  I tell her maybe she should got to the address shown on her receipt and get her refund there  Showing her the public street sign finally clicked something in her mind and she stormed off  got in her car  and left  Didn’t apologize or say a word  I later found out the store on the receipt had gone out of business a few months earlier,2439,477

648,j0nq2g,1,93,Um   you are in the wrong store This has happened so many times during my years in retail  that if I had a dollar for every time it happened  I wouldnt have to work in retail anymore  What I am  of course  referring to  is when a customer comes into your store  says a product is on special  and then eventually realises that it is on special elsewhere  or it was on special last week I block a lot of these out these days  but looking at an old facebook memory today  I got reminded of one of my earliest  and a classic  situation like this Back at the turn of the century  I worked for one of the two major supermarkets chains in this country  lets call them Colds  The location I worked at  was what I would call supermarket central   if you had a supermarket chain  you had a location within  kilometre distance  There were about  or  supermarkets within a   kilometre radius of our location  and just within the immediate vicinity  there were all four major chains  the two majors  a third major that was about to go bust  and a fourth which is independently owned franchises  all within walking distance  So it was common for people to start to get confused with what supermarket they were in I was working the checkouts this one day  when the customer  lets call him Mr C  comes in  I am there  scanning his items  when he notices a discrepancy with the price of an item Mr C  Excuse me  the price of that ice cream is wrong Me  How so Mr C  Well  you have charged me     yet it is on special for   Me  Let me just check on that   where did you see it advertised on special Mr C  It was in your catalog Me  Ok  let me just have a look I then browse the catalog  and find no mention of the ice cream being on special Me  Im sorry sir  but it is not in the catalog Mr C  Yes it is Me  Sorry sir  but I have just looked through the entire catalog  and it is not in here Mr C  Give that to me Mr C grabs the catalog out of my of hands  and then proceeds to look through it  He then looks through it a second time  and then throws it down Mr C  This is the wrong catalog  Why have you shown me the wrong catalog  I want to speak to a supervisor Me  Excuse me sir  but this is the correct catalog  If you have a look at the front page of the catalog  you will see the dates that the specials are on for Mr C  Dont give me any of this nonsense  Leave all my stuff here  Im going home to get the catalog that YOU guys put in MY mailbox  to show YOU what the specials are Me  Ok sir Mr C left  and I did a deferred sale  even though I was not expecting him to come back  Amazingly   minutes later  he did  And he came straight to my checkout  trying to interrupt my sale Mr C  See  I told you Me  Excuse me sir  do you mind waiting while I serve this customer Mr C  No   you pay attention to me  and now Me   to the customer on my checkout  Ill just be a second   To Mr C  Fine  show me Mr C proceeds to open the catalog  straight to where the ice cream is on special  But I had already noticed three things wrong with it  so was going to bring each of them up  one at a time Me  Firstly  sir  the ice cream that is on special  may be the same brand that you are trying to purchase  but it is the wrong size Mr C  What do you mean Me  Well  the one you are trying to purchase is a  litre tub of ice cream  The one on special is the  litre tub Mr C  I dont care   still give me the special Me  Well  if I was to still give you the special  it would be the same sort of special as there is off the  litre tub   which would mean that you would actually be paying MORE Mr C  This is just flagrant misadvertising Me  Secondly  look at the dates of the specials   this was LAST WEEKS catalog Mr C  I didnt know of the special last week   you should keep them running for longer Me  And finally  I would like you to look at the store sign above you Mr C  Ok  and   Me  And now look at the logo on the front of the catalog Mr C  And   Me  Now compare the two   are they the same Mr C  Um   Mr C at this point became very quiet  and quickly scurried out of there,4157,774

650,j0ar75,1,16,It’s the customer hostility for me  I work at a popular retail store in the mall  We started a rewards program last year and I knew it would be annoying to deal with the moment it was announced  Especially when managers start threatening to doc you if you don’t have a certain amount of sign ups  Anyway  today I asked a customer if he wanted to sign up for it  but you can only sign up by scanning the QR code with your phone camera  We don’t have the option to sign customers up behind the register yet  So customer comes up with his girlfriend and he starts by asking if we have military discount  C  Customer CG  Customers girlfriend Conversation as follows Me  Hello did you find everyth   C  Do you have military discount   immediately gets slightly annoyed because he cut me off  Me  No we don’t  I’m sorry  But if you sign up for our loyalty program you can save   off your first purchase  It’s not a credit card or anything    CG    laughs   Wow they don’t care about military   C  Right  Um sure  how do I sign up for it Me  Just scan the QR code in front of you with your camera and it’ll take you to the signup page At this point I have already shut down because I know they’re gonna be draining to deal with  So as he‘s signing up I started ringing his items  Mind you  the mall WiFi Service can be pretty trashy sometimes  so it’s best to have good data  Especially if we’re having bad weather that day  which rain  was  the case yesterday C  It’s taking forever to load  What can we do Me  Ah  do you have data  If so turn off the WiFi and use that instead C  I’m not sure if I have any  Why are they making you sign customers up for this bs if the internet doesn’t work   Do you know this is an issue Me  Umm it’s my job to sign up customers for our program  I have to ask you    The entire mall has bad service  But it’s also raining outside  so that could be the reason why the Internet is slow today    C    smacks lips   I want my    Y’all are playing with my emotions  What can you do  Me  Theres nothing I can do about it  I can’t control the WiFi if it’s not working     And we don’t have the option of signing customers up behind the register  C   Customer continued ranting about the WiFi  But I can’t remember exactly what he said because I tuned him out and focused on ringing his items  Me    Cuts him off mid rant   K  Your total is    Then he pays and snatches his bag out my hand lol  But I remained unbothered  customers have been super snappy lately  You really become numb to it at some point But wait  I have another story that happened the same day A different customer was arguing with someone on the phone  Naturally  because he was already angry I hoped I didn’t have to ring him up  My intuition was telling me he would’ve took whatever issue he was having out on me  But luckily my co worker got him instead  and I was correct  He took his anger out on him  Coworker told me he was folding his clothes and the customer started yelling at him about how he felt “disrespected” and snatched the clothes out of my coworkers hands to refold them  He demonstrated how he folded the customers clothes and it was very neat  that guy was just being rash and wanted to have a reason to be nasty since he was having a bad day  These people need to meditate and burn some sage TLDR  Customer is mad that we don’t have a military discount and have slow WiFi then blames me for it  Another customer had a bad day and said my coworker was disrespecting him by not folding his clothes a certain way,3577,652

652,izv34m,1,27,Department Store Hell I work in a department store that always has sales on almost everything in the store  On this particular day   days ago  my shift was manning the registers by myself from open to close  Customers were getting mad over every little thing  They had to wait in line  some read sale signs wrong and threw a big fit  one lady started screaming because her order pickup wasnt ready even though she didnt get the email confirmation  and there were several complicated returns  Mind you  this was my fourth day working at the store  To say in the least  I was absolutely done  The real fun started when a guy in his mid s came to the register  He had one Adidas hoodie and two Nike golf shirts  I started ringing him up and the total came out to around    He immediately jumped on me saying that the total should be    I do a price check and mens athletics were BOGO   off  so my calculations were correct  He would not take no for an answer  I tried explaining  and doing the math for him several times  but he insisted that I was wrong  After about  minutes he finally said   Forget it  Youre machine is saying a different price than the sign   and promptly left  No  sir  The register is right  your brain is not  It finally dawned on me that he thought BOGO meant that he would buy only one item and get it   off  In conclusion  I think retail has finally broke me,1413,263
653,izmfeo,1,95,Bag of milk  I worked at the service desk at a large grocery store  This happened to my manager who was working the desk with me  I was just an eyewitness to this exchange It was the middle of winter which means in Michigan the temperature can drop below  degrees quite often  A woman came in and claimed she had gotten her groceries the day before but had forgotten to take her gallon of milk into her house with the rest of her groceries  When she went to her car the next morning she saw her milk   all frozen and the plastic container split  She took it back inside her house and left it in the double bag  Well of course after a few hours all the milk was thawed  She threw away the plastic container and brought the bag of milk in to be replaced  No idea why she didnt throw out the milk and bring in the container  Of course we replaced the milk  I dont know why  it wasnt our fault she left it outside all night PS the woman is a college professor,962,185

661,iw6g3b,1,99,Can I mix deadly Chemicals  No  Ill rub oranges on it  On mobile so sorry for formatting  I work at a hardware store for context A middle aged woman approached me today while I was in our paint department and began asking about what we have to remove rust from her outdoor metal chairs  Ive got just the thing to do it fast so I take her to our naval jelly and explain to her how you would apply it onto the rusted areas and then wash it off after  mins blah blah blah  The lady tells me how she doesnt like the idea of rinsing it off Cus then it will go into the water  She then asks if she can use it to remove paint as well and I let her know that its formulated specifically for rust so she would need to use something like a paint remover  I show her the paint removers we have and she says she doesnt want to use them because the chemicals are too strong  Her  Well do you have anything environmentally friendly that I can use Me  Sure  We have this item which is made from naturally occurring acids in oranges as well as other naturally sourced additives  Its should peel up the paint after you allow it to sit them youll take a putty knife and scrape it off Her  Well can I just scrape the old paint and rust off instead of using the chemicals because I dont want to use them Me  For the paint you could try to just scrape it off and the rust could probably be sanded down to the bare metal but thats a lot more work Her  Well what does bare metal look like Cus Ive already tried sanding it off Me  Depending on what kind of metal it is it could be a light or dark silver color and it probably will look rather dull  Her  oh okay and is there a tool I can use to scape it off Me  you could use a putty knife or sand paper Her  no I mean like a power tool Me  Well they have sanders that are in power tool variants Her  oh I dont want to sand it though  Are you sure there isnt anything else to remove the rust thats safer so I wont have to rinse it off Me  For the tight spaces that you cant sand or scrape down to bare metal youll probably need to use something like this naval jelly to break down the rust Her  Oh  well I just really dont want to rinse it off Cus then it will get in the water that will be recycled and cleaned then we will be drinking it and I dont want children drinking that  Me  I know it really sucks but other than this youd have to look online for home remedies to remove it Her  Well I tried that and used vinegar but it didnt clean it and I just cant find anything that works  Do you think if I mix this naval jelly with the citrus paint stripper that I could use them and it would make the naval jelly less toxic Me  No mama and youll definitely not want to mix any of these cleaning products as it could cause a chemical reaction Her  But the citrus one is organic it should be fine Me  Even though its sourced from more natural items like oranges it still has enough chemicals to peel off paint and mixing that with naval jelly could be very dangerous Her  Oh okay    well maybe if I just buy oranges and rub them on the chair it will get the paint off  Im just gonna keep looking Me  okay have a good night and good luck with your project She then stood there for about  more minutes before consulting another employee and leaving afterwards with the naval jelly and the citrus cleaner  I really hope she didnt bring them home and mixing them up expecting one to cancel out the chemicals in the other  Sometimes Im in awe of how customers think  Sorry if this was boring I just thought this was so absurd I needed to share Tldr  Woman wants a non toxic way to remove old paint and rust  Doesnt like how our product has chemicals and needs to be rinsed off  Thinks that maybe if she rubs oranges on her chair it will magically be clean then asks if she can mix one of our non toxic cleaners with a stronger one to cancel out the toxicity  Is told no then after thinking it over she leave with the recommended items,4034,765
662,iw01au,1,15,Shiny New Corvette  This is my first post on Tales from Retail   So here goes   I was working at a Gas Station in the Northern United States   You people that live in Canada and the Upper Midwest will know how a cold winter night  is with a strong wind a blowing         It is really cold and it is Saturday evening   No one really wants to be out on a night like this and I am glad I am inside   In drives New Corvette Owner  NCO from now on   He drives in and gets out of his brand New Corvette   You might ask how I knew it was new   Again  the readers that live in the far North will know that cars will just pick up nasty road grime and salt from driving on the road   This Corvette is spotless   I think he is coming in to top off the fuel tank and he is going to park it until he can enjoy that T top in the warm weather   NCO gets out and puts the gas nozzle into the fuel fill hole   On this year of Corvette the fill hole is in between the rear window on the deck lid   NCO starts to pump gas and proceeds to walk into the store   I immediately turn the fuel pump off from the register because it is a state law that the person that is pumping the fuel must be outside the vehicle and in view of the fuel nozzle   He is at the pumps that are farthest to the left on the gas station lot  We are on the corner of a  lane road and  lane road   Both of these roads are very busy   The area that he has parked this New Corvette is on a slight incline to the  lane road        I know why NCO is coming in because there is a bloody cold wind blowing in on the tundra   He walks in and I make eye contact   I tell him I know it is cold out there  but you need to stay by your vehicle   It is a state law and not my rules   NCO screams WHAT   WHY         I look up at NCOs New Corvette   I tell him for that reason right there and point to his  New Corvette that is starting to roll down the incline and it is picking up speed   That New Corvette is on an appointment with that busy  lane road  Usain Bolt would have been proud of how fast NCO ran out and leaped into his New Corvette   He slammed the emergency break on   NCO got out  and finished fueling that shiny  New Corvette   Walks in rather casually after fueling and not another word about our previous exchange   NCO walks out and zooms away in that spotless Corvette  That could have been ugly for him and the New Corvette,2401,531
663,ivqf9z,1,126,Some cant take a joke  some own it  This is a story from a few years ago  but I just found this subreddit and it reminded me I was a cashier at a local supermarket  and we have a law that if alcohol is being bought and the cashier estimates someone to be under   they have to ask for ID  While it offends some people  it is a pretty good way to get to check an ID and see if someone is over   the legal age to buy alcohol  No ID is also no alcohol I decided to have sone fun with it  and whenever I estimated someone to be over   I would also ask them for an ID  Usually this got a laugh  sometimes it got people offended  once a lady even called for a manager  who had to come to clarify to her that it was a joke  You know the type   However  one man ruled the joke  He was just buying a few beers  and I asked him for his ID because he looked way into his s  He laughed  grabbed his wallet  and handed me a card in a plastic casing  Still with a huge smile on his face  he asked me  Do you know what that is  It looked sort of like an ID  but I had never seen anything like that one   What I could tell was that it was old and something from the military  He said   What you are holding now is my military ID from the second world war  Is that a valid ID here  Because I no longer have my drivers licence  It was at that point that I was at a loss for words  This man took my joke  handed it back and won,1433,294
664,ivptcx,1,4,Customer is always right   pardon  Okay  tell me who in the world came up with this phrase and who actually believes that  Because everyone who worked in a retail would question that I work at an online retailing  Most of my inquiries are online  so at least I dont have to communicate with anyone face to face  Ive had my own share of every single kind of people  Nice and just generally sweet  people who appear just once in a blue moon with interesting questions  and then disappear   people who dont question you any questions and just buy and are happy with their purchases and then     nightmare ish Karens who appear during the full moon or before one when it is quickly approaching My story consists of a Karen  I sell clothing  and they   of the time are brand new  with tags  although I do mention if the clothing dont have tags and or the customer has to be aware of something  They are original on the cheap prices especially if they have not been bought for months and they are just dusting at this rate  so sometimes you have to make discount just to sell them  Its okay I was contacted by a Karen who bought a pair of boyfriend jeans  Alright  And today she arrives with a message asking me if those are male jeans   I told her no but I also explained her the model and that boyfriend jeans is just inspired by male jeans  Makes sense  cue the name  right  I thought this will be the end for me  Haha  you know I wish it was  There is an inside tag where you can check the model in the internet for yourself  too  I also explained it to her and said that she can compare it to what she sees in the pictures  as in to help her out   This was only the pair of jeans of that model that I was selling and I dont remember the code nor the model name  We dont write these things down Before she starts attacking me  saying that there is a defect and that jeans shouldnt look like that  because she had other jeans of this model  yet the moments ago she was accusing me that those are men jeans    I told her to send me the pictures of a defect   Did she send me one  No  I am still waiting  She attacked me with a hunch of messages right away and now that I have requested her to send me the proof   she is awfully silent I will probably keep updating OP as the story revolves  So far waiting for the pictures You know  what pisses me off the most  Is that you always have to be tactful and nice with them  But they are losing it with an each passing message and you can see how offensive they become  Yet you have to try and be opposite of them because this is what its required of you  It did ruin my mood  I wont lie  Karens are especially talented at destroying your mood,2716,514
665,iv9r4y,1,27,Customer Wants A Outlet With A Light That Last’s Forever  I just thought of this one time a few month ago where I had a customer with one of those electrical outlets the have that dim glow from a built in LED  Told me she bought it a while ago  but the light has gone out  and wanted a new bulb to replace it  I told her the outlet still works  so she can still use it normally  but she didn’t want to use it without a working light  I told her they don’t make new lights for those outlets because they are built in  so she’d have to buy a new outlet  I take her down and show her the options  She then says something that kinda flabbergasted me  She said “And the lights in these are guaranteed to work forever right ” I told her no  they will burn out eventually  She says “Well  I want something that lasts forever ” I told her that was not possible  and she asked me why not  I explained that everything goes through wear and tear  The lights in the outlets are no exception  I said to her you could get months out of these lights  or quite a few years  But eventually they will give out  and the light will burn out  She wasn’t to thrilled by my answer  and reluctantly took a new outlet  I just laughed after she left  Anyone knows all things wear out and give out eventually  It’s not a question of if  it’s always when,1335,258

671,iuq4ng,1,3,Hurricane season Since we’re waiting for a storm to hit it reminded me of this story my mom told me  My parents went through hurricane Andrew in the s in Miami and my mom worked at a large grocery chain  They decided that a manager from every store had to stay IN THE STORE during the storm  For her store the manager they chose they told him it was because “he was young and didn’t have a family” so they were literally willing to sacrifice his life for product  The entire front of the store was glass and he was on the phone with another manager when it blew in   Underground telephone lines  He told the other manager he had to go because the storm was now inside the store  They left that man to die there  She said he was beyond traumatized when they came the next day and he was just kind of sitting in what was left of the store  He didn’t even have a flashlight because all hurricane supplies had been sold  I can’t even imagine how much that lawsuit would be if there was even a WHISPER of that happening now  That’s honestly one of the worst things I’ve ever heard a corporation doing to workers at least in the modern age  If there’s a better place for this let me know and I’ll move it there,1207,232
672,iungx7,1,12,The Curse of the  Item on Hold  So  youre a sales clerk working on commission  Thats respectable  Admirable  even  Lord knows it takes hustle to earn that paycheck  more power to you  Youre a powerhouse But wait  whats this  Ah  a customer approaches  But not just any customer  Well    technically not yet even a customer  Theyve got something in their arms  but they dont want it now  they need to think about it  They need to ask their mother for an opinion  They left their wallet in the car  Theyd like to shop the rest of the mall first and then return to you at the end of the day  dont worry  though  they parked in the ramp connected to your store  so theyre guaranteed to swing through again   What do you do  Youre technically not allowed to put items on hold   against company policy  they say  Everyone does it  though  even the managers that make that claim  Exceptions are made for clients you know    or have a good feeling about  Plus  this person seems so excited about the item  Surely  holding it for them this time would be fine  Especially if you let them know that youre technically not supposed to do holds  but youll make an exception for them  The gratitude  You can see it on their faces  plain as day  They feel special  Important They go about their business  and you tuck it away and mark it as ON HOLD  You feel good  You feel positive  Youve finally made a sale today  in the future though it may be   and the ever present stress of  sellsellsell  eases off of your shoulders just slightly  You breathe  Unbeknownst to you  someone slips through your department during the minute youre in the back  on a mission for this exact item  They dont find it  and leave  dejected You re emerge onto the floor  a renewed confidence in your step  No one else asks you to put anything else on hold  Better than that   you make some sales  Something your eyes unavoidably miss  though   the coworker working order fulfillment in the back  searching for the very item youve put on hold  On their screen  it shows that your store has only one in stock  and  neither able to find it on the floor nor in the back  theyre forced to reject the request  This person has already paid for the item through online ordering  but alas  if its not there then its not there  Theyll get their refund if no other stores end up having it in stock  either An hour passes  and then two  Your shift is nearing its end  and the sun has long since set  The store itself is subtly shifting into end of the day mode  and you begin to have doubts  Another hour passes  The store begins to close  A personal stylist swans their way up to your cashwrap  asking if youve seen a specific item  Well  yes  actually  Its the one youd put on hold  They glide into the back after it and then whisk it away  destining it to a fitting room for tomorrow where it will accessorize a curve fitting Max Mara suit and sleek Manolo Blahnik heels  Its just as well  you think  Shell be the one most likely to make the sale  anyway  True enough  you never see the customer from earlier again The next day  a repeat with subtle changes  Another customer  except this time shell be back in ten minutes  You kindly and regretfully inform her that youre not allowed to put anything on hold  Shes taken aback  Shes a regular customer  she tells you  and shes put things on hold here before  Recently  even  You fully believe this and delicately explain that the policies have changed  You apologize profusely for it  She is very startled by this newfound knowledge  She buys her   hairclips  of which we have over a dozen  and are at no risk of selling out of in ten minutes   and then leaves The next day  a repeat with more significant changes  Someone wants to buy one of the few designer pieces you have in your department   a Burberry  specifically  More than that  actually  a thick  heavy Burberry cape that is  in your store  one of a kind  Its priced at over     it alone will max out your sales numbers for the day  and    you succumb once again  agreeing to put it on hold  This woman is waiting for feedback from a friend  Its an investment  and she needs a second opinion  Understandable Surprisingly  she  does  come back later  Even more surprising  Shes in  She wants it  One snag  though  You freeze  dread and resignation rising in equal measure  and immediately stop the transaction  A literal snag  going straight up the back a solid six inches  You point it out to the customer  and her jaw drops  She is  incredibly  grateful to you for spotting this  An idea does occur to you  though  You have an amazing alterations department  You cant make any promises  but they frequently work miracles and its possible that theyd be able to fix the snag  Spoiler  They are  and they do  She comes back an hour later and  imperfections vanished  she buys it You’re floating for the rest of the day  from both the praise your service received and the reprieve from the   SELLSELLSELL        that’s scorched into the deepest recesses of your mind  Thats never been your focus  youve never cared about the numbers  and my god this is a relief Two days later  a coworker from a neighboring department sheepishly walks over  shes your friend  and youd told her about your dramatic sale   It turns out that someone had come over to do a return with her just minutes before and she  of course  was tasked with bringing the item back to its correct department  She hands you your beautifully mended Burberry cape  Your heart sinks You dont put things on hold anymore,5612,983

679,it1jhg,1,19,A customer gets upset with me for spelling her name wrong  When I was working for a retail store  we had a system where if you were a rewards member  you could type in your phone number and have us type in your name for you on your receipt  this does serve a purpose but I dont want to get into that because that would disclose my workplace    Well  this one older lady and her younger  but still older  friend comes to my register   The younger older friend tells me that she told her older friend about this fantastic sale we were having on a certain item I ring up the older lady for her item and she has a rewards account so she types in her phone number and asks to personalize it with her name  again  cant mention the details without giving myself away    You see  Im hard of hearing and after fruitless attempts from both women to spell it out  I ask the older woman to write her name   I go to type it in and  by accident  got one letter wrong because it looked like another letter  and it sounded like it  too    The receipt prints out and Older Woman looks at it and scowls    Well  crap  Older Woman was upset that I had spelled her name wrong   I tried in vain to tell her that one letter looked like the other and apologized but she didnt have any of it   She was upset that I got it wrong despite her writing it out and looked at me like I was an idiot   I looked to her younger older friend who told me not to worry about it   I offer the Older Woman her receipt and she just snatches it out of my hand and slightly storms out of the store with her friend behind her,1591,316

681,isutus,1,37,Oh  you didnt need to bring me flowers  Yall ready for a wholesome story for once This happened half a year or so ago when I was working on a little tobacco store  It was pretty laid back as we were allowed to have an attitude with rude customers  We were the only one who sold cigarettes in a mayor train station so wed always have enough customers  But no one was allowed to be rude to regulars  EVER  Most of the regulars were really nice and since I worked the registers most of the time I got to know all of them a little bit  Especially this one mechanic who always got his Pall Mall Red every day at the same time between trains  Now  wed always crack jokes with people and keep it laid back  My favourite joke was when a customer happens to carry flowers and came to the register Id say  Oh  you didnt need to bring me flowers   Most people laughed and we carried on like normal  maybe a bit happier  So one day the mechanic comes in carrying a dozen white roses wrapped really beautifully in gift paper  I give my usual line of  You didnt need to bring me flowers  and he was like  Yes I do  its your birthday today right  These are actually for you  MY REGULAR REMEMBERED MY BIRTHDAY THAT I MAYBE TOLD HIM ONCE  This was so touching and what I like about retail  You build a good connection with your regulars and get to know random people your otherwise wouldnt know Hope you enjoy,1425,263

684,iseybg,1,40,So much for calling in sick to avoid customers  All the context needed here is that I work as a Store Manager at a phone retailer and I called in sick today  Suddenly  my phone rings  I dont have any friends so I immediately know its my rep calling for some help   usually his questions are quick and easy or he needs a Spanish translation for a customer  He apologizes for bothering me but hes having trouble with a language barrier  No big deal  or so I thought  put them on the phone  I spent the next  minutes or so going back and forth with the customer telling me every single variation of the same thing  Digging in their account revealed they had a family plan with us and that her son had recently taken his line to another provider  Without going into boring detail  basically no matter what phone provider you are with in the US  with the exception of Prepaid providers   when you sign a contract for a phone  the most important line is that  If you leave the provider  they will charge the remaining balance of the contracted phone to your bill  in one lump sum   The customer refused to listen to me when I told her that she broke the contract by taking the line somewhere else  Everytime I tried a different phrasing to explain to her she just came making up excuses refusing to take responsibility  even saying this was my companies fault for not bringing back the line when she asked customer service to do so  At this point I had run out of ways of asking why she left in the first place  reiterating that if she leaves its not our problem and I told her flat out  this cannot be solved in store  go talk to the other provider  they still have the line in question  then talk to customer service  Before I could say anything else  she told me  I can tell youre Puerto Rican as well  and im not here to argue with you  As I was about to answer she hung up on me herself  I was beyond annoyed and just happy I didnt have to talk to her anymore  I know Puerto Ricans are stubborn but JFC its not that hard to understand you have to take responsibility for your actions  Sorry for the long post  after this my Sunday was soured so I just felt like I needed to rant a bit,2202,417

687,is4nbf,1,31,Everyone shut up the Prophet has arrived Obligatory not my story disclaimer  This is from my sister’s job from about a year ago  I’m gonna write in first person for the sake of avoiding unnecessary verbosity This was about a year ago in the summer and I was working a long shift  I work at a store that rents and sells tuxedos and suits for prom  weddings  etc   Anything you need a suit for we can do it   This was an out of the ordinary occurrence  I was helping out a couple with their wedding colors  a wedding that would round out to be a couple thousand dollars in suits  when a mysterious fellow walked in  He announced to my store  “I am the Prophet Eric TheCrazyMan Taylor ”  Fake name  but I promise the real one was just as strange   “And God has sent a message to me ” The only other person working with me was new and has only been in the store for two weeks so I had her take over the wedding and went to help the Prophet  I knew this would be above her pay grade  Me  What can I do for you sir The Prophet  God has sent me a message  that I need a suit and a celebration to mark the end of my fast  Me  We can do that for you sir  Any specific styles or colors you have in mind Queue some on script chit chat and insane responses from the Prophet and I get his ideas  A white tuxedo with tails and a top hat  Now  we don’t sell top hats  The best we have are the small top hats that we give to toddlers to be ring bearers  Furthermore we don’t stock tails  We would need to special order from our plant to make that happen  I order everything in  I get him out of my store  He comes in a week later to try everything on and do alterations  The next week comes  I’m helping the new trainee with ringing out a Quinceañera when he arrives once more  His standard greeting  of course “I am the Prophet Eric TheCrazyMan Taylor ” Now  this man is dressed to the  nines   He’s in a bright green coat that brushes the floor  he has dreadlocks wrapped around his head  and a tall wooden staff with green  I can only assume fake  gems  I’m giving you more details than you need because you have to believe this was really a real man I encountered in the st century in an upscale formalwear setting  He tries on his stuff  looks dapper in his tails  and requests his top hat  I tell him we can only give him a small toddler sized hat and he seems pleased  He puts it on  and wraps his dreadlocks around it to keep it in place  He is a sight to be seen  Everything seems to his liking and he takes it off  but arrives out of the dressing room with his hat still on  I request it back so I can ring him out and he takes it off  His dreadlock falls on the floor  He doesn’t notice  I ring him out but he can’t pay  After a long hour of him calling around he finds a woman from his church  cult   to front the bill  After all  it is a divine god mandated expense  The bill comes to over   and the woman tells me her card details happily over the phone  stating “Not as much as I expected ” What  You expected this  He leaves with his things  and his dreadlock is still on the floor  Trainee looks at me in confusion and asks “Do we    throw it away ” I nod silently and she puts on gloves  picks it up  and tosses it in the garbage in the back  Other customers in the store are really starting to get a kick out of this  Just one more step  returns He doesn’t  He doesn’t return his things for over five weeks  racking up a   late fee  all charged to the church woman’s card  She calls and asks me why these charges are appearing and I told her this was the card on file for the Prophet  She hangs up crying  The Prophet returns in three more days  He calls his bank to transfer the charges to his own card  luckily  and puts his card on file for me  The bank has to call me to confirm everything and while that’s happening the Prophet informs me he’s missing his sermon  I tell him I can’t go any faster  so  like a sane human being  he calls his church  In the middle of my store with customers being fitted and spoken to he calls the church  and gives a sermon over the phone in complete gibberish  Passionately  Loudly  I couldn’t believe it  I didn’t know what to do so I just went to help other people but I could hear it no matter where I went  Customers are laughing and I’m apologizing profusely but they’re in complete awe of this character  This hero of a man  Finally  after thirty minutes he hangs up and passes the sermon over to what I can only assume is another pastor  but who knows  The card is accepted  the charges go through  He finally leaves I clock out early,4637,885

699,iq9hwz,1,2,Scanner Cancer  Standard on mobile disclaimer So this particular customer was    interesting to say the least She comes up with a fully loaded cart  easily   worth of items and most are    Before I can even pick up the first item  she tells me that I have to type in the SKU number for every item  and I cant scan them because her doctor told her the radiation would give her cancer I explained to that it isnt a laser  its just a light  I made up the fact that the plastic lens blocks ionising radiation  I told her that even if it was a laser the radiation they emit isnt harmful ionising radiation and it would only be a ridiculously low amount  and of course  it isnt a laser  just a red light  On top of which  the items are mostly in boxea  and paper doesnt hold ionising radiation  That she was absorbing more radiation from the sun and the florescent lights  That if she was really that sensitive she would have gotten cancer while walking to the store,982,177
700,iq8vct,1,1,One smokey afternoon A few years ago we were experiencing some nearby forest fire smoke in the atmosphere in town  Things were rather red  smokey  dramatic looking   you get it  I was working at an upscale kitchen store at the time and our customers ran the gamut from colourful  out of touch  to the downright mean  rude Tiffany clad reptiles   On this smokey day a customer comes in and they are at the til paying for their trinkets  A discussion about the wildfires is happening nearby as its pretty darn noticeable  She pivots to this conversation   an opportunity  They moan about the air quality and the lack of visibility together  We finish our transaction at the til and before she leaves she is wrapping up her air quality critique by directing at me  Its awful  I dont know how YOU PEOPLE put up with it  And she leaves Now  a  you people  should always be used thoughtfully  or not at all   but Ive always wondered what she meant  Did she think I started the fire  Or some other young urbanite set to ruin her week at the cabin I thought about her today  I hope shes happy choking down whatever air those people have subjected her to without complaint,1180,207
701,iq4uol,1,17,Thrown under the bus for saying “She throws us under the bus ” This was years ago  as I was working at a fabric craft store  We were pretty busy that day and it was one of those times that you would be darned if you did darned if you didn’t leave your post and go up to help at the register  Both lines were uncontrollable  We were short handed for some reason  My manager back then was  well to put it nicely  extremely out of shape  She’s one of those  how in the world did this woman get to be manager types  Lazy and stupid to top it off  There were two Karens who were together to return something and complain to the manager  Nothing better than a Karen who has a wingman right   I would go up and ring someone and go back to the counter and was trying to balance the lines  There was only maybe  or  of us all together on the floor  not enough of us to get rid of the lines and the manager  the only key holder  was holed up in the back  I called and called again  Kept calling over and over and she just wouldn’t come out of the office  Finally the Karens were like “Is there a manager who can help us   We have been waiting and waiting and you guys won’t help us  ” I walked by them and with my voice cracking said “I have called her like seven times  I’m trying to get her out here but she won’t come out of the office  She throws us under the bus all the time ” Which she did  She was ALWAYS just sitting in the office because she was so out of shape  It was like pulling teeth getting her to come up to the registers and I was done with it that day  As I was clocking out for the day back in the office  she was telling me and another coworker about the Karens  how awful they were and she goes “they told me that you said I throw you guys under the bus  can you believe that  ” I froze  trying not to have my eyes as big as silver dollars  Her back was to me  My coworker said “I can’t believe that  That doesn’t sound ANYTHING you would ever say ” I made a snap decision to roll with it  “Pshh  Yeah  That’s weird  Unbelievable ” It was a perfect opportunity to make Karens sound like Karens  I was in the clear  They threw ME under the bus  I was trying my best to get the manager out there and they ratted me out  It was one of the only times in my life where I had to make a snap decision to bluff lol,2331,466
702,iq4osw,1,31,Customer’s child makes my day This was a story that happened to me a while ago but I’ve decided I feel like sharing it today A couple of years ago I was working the customer service desk at a grocery store  Our store sells lottery tickets at the service desk  and as I’m sure most people who have dealt with them know  people can be very picky about their lottery tickets  Well one day a woman who looks to be in her mid late s comes up with her child who was probably only   years old max  She asks me for two Mega Millions tickets  So I get them for her and the exchange went as follows Me  Here are your  Mega Millions Customer  I asked for  Poweball Me  Uhm  I’m sorry miss but you definitely asked for Mega Millions Customer  I know what I said  I said I wanted two Powerball Kid  No Mommy you said Mega Millions Customer   looks at child then back to me  Oh  I did Me  Yes  but I can still get you two powerball if you like Customer  No that’s okay  I’ll just take the Mega Millions She then pays and they leave  but everyone I told about it that day got a kick out of it  Wherever you are kid  thanks for looking out,1150,213
703,iq0a8e,1,21,Almost made a TalesFromTheCustomer story by seemingly being disrespectful Few years ago  but Im having a bad day so I wanted to recount this silly story  I was working in Electronics at the real world version of Dane Cooks Super Club  This middle aged guy came up to me to talk about laptops  a very typical exchange He gives me enough information to know which laptop he wants  its just not on sale  Never buy a laptop from Super Club not on sale  because Newegg Amazon will have better for cheaper  So I pull out my phone mid statement  The convo went like so Me  Yeah I definitely think this one will work for you  slightly under my breath  but I dont like that price  let me see here  Proceed to check online if its on sale here but online  or if Newegg Amazon does indeed have cheaper Man  You think this one will work huh  Well I think  uh   He pauses here and I didnt really know why until he continued Man  I see  Well  thank you for your time This gets me to look up as Im not expecting such a turn  As he starts to walk away I realize whats happening Me  Wait  Wait  Im sorry I should have explained  Im looking this up to see if this is online for cheaper I turn my phone to show him before he starts to laugh  then we both share a chuckle as he explains he thought I just lost interest during the conversation  I still feel bad that I made him think this way and Im glad I showed him it was my mistake,1443,263
704,ipsoxv,1,32,Why isn’t the internet working   I topped up yesterday   So I work in a telco retail store  We have to deal with technologically challenged people all the time  obviously tech isn’t everyone’s forte which is fine  But patience and learning is always something you would assume someone is capable of  Anyway  I had this elderly gentleman come into the store for probably the third time this week  He has a pre payed plan which he tops up every month and every time he comes in he asks about his internet on his phone  in which we assure he has because it’s provided within his plan  But today he came in pretty pissed off  “here we go again” I think to myself  He’s complaining that we are taking his money and ripping him off  “why is there no internet  ” He says  I check his account and his plan is active and working  there’s heaps of data available  So I grab his phone and have a look  Not to my surprise  his Mobile Data isn’t even switched on   So this is time where my patience has worn thin and my stern grown up voice is switched on  To his defence he is a foreign older dude who struggles with English  but how can you use a smart phone  know how to txt call  use what’s app and then not know how to turn the Data on  Even when I went to show him make him turn it on he was arguing the fact that he isn’t good with tech  I just had to tell him that it doesn’t matter  I will show you and then you will know  The problem was fixed in a matter of a swipe and a click  I just hope he retains the information I provided and doesn’t come back in to endlessly grizzle about technology  It just becomes frustrating where you have a stubborn customer not willing to even listen and learn,1701,320

711,io1ki1,1,26,Woman tries to get a refund on a defective product  was using the wrong charger  So this happened today  which is the last day of my work week so that sucks TL Dr Karen brings in wrong charger for her device  blows up when it needs testing just to be shown that shes been using the wrong charger the whole time I had a lady call up first thing in the morning asking for a refund for a product that hasnt worked since the day she bought it which was  weeks ago Company policy is if an electrical appliance isnt working  weeks after purchase  it needs to be assessed to ensure its being used correctly  Had karen dealt with this when she realised the product was malfunctioning  it would have taken half a second  but alas  for some reason  she left it I explained the policy over the phone and she started ranting about Fair trading and consumer law  I explained that she was welcome to drop in  have an assessment done while she waited or did other shopping  Nope not good enough She said she was going to speak to consume affairs and hung up She comes in to the store a few hours later  says Fair trading took her side and shell be receiving her refund  I say   nope  Im checking the machine first  thats when I find the wrong charger piled up with the rest of the stuff   Sorry maam  this is the wrong charger  have you been using this charger the whole time or do you have other rechargeable devices plug in to the same area    I offer to plug her machine in to the charger of our display unit to check if using the correct charger will fix it Karen goes nuclear  demands I call the person dealing with her complaint at fair trading so I do after getting her machine on the correct charger  and I explain to fair trading that the machine has been brought in with the wrong charger and if this is the charger being used the whole time  that would be why the machine isnt working  thus no refund  I offer to plug her machine in to the charger of our display unit to check if using the correct charger will fix itBy the end of the phone call the machine has charged enough to run for longer than Karen has ever had it run  showing that the correct charger  which should be somewhere in her home  will make the machine charge normally I wish the story had a happy ending but because Karen was causing such a scene  manager stepped in and did the refund anyway just to get rid of her  but it was a joy to have fair trading go from being on Karens side to on the companys side,2508,467

713,ino4p2,1,28,That’s not how this works lady A few years ago I had this lady come in asking about her layaway  She asked me if she wanted only a few pieces out of her layaway if she had to get the whole layaway out or if she could just get those few pieces  I told her it was all or none of it and what ever didn’t get she’s getting the money back for  She said okay and continued to shop around for a bit  Now one thing to note was this was at the height of springtime for allergy sufferers  I have really bad allergies and honestly this day I was riding the struggle bus on being at work  You could tell I wasn’t at   and that all I wanted to do go home and sleep  Anyways so she comes up to the counter to get her layaway out  She picks out the two pieces she wants to keep and tells my coworker she wanted to return the other four pieces  Co worker returns the four pieces she didn’t want and gives her the money back  The woman tells her she didn’t give her enough back  My coworker looks at her confused and the following conversation takes place  CW coworker  M me  W customerCW  yes ma’am I gave you back the price of each item as it states on your receipt  W  no you didn’t  I had six pieces in my layaway  you still owe me for the other two pieces  CW  no ma’am you kept those two pieces so you don’t get the money back for them  W  let me speak with your manager M  what’s going on  CW  she wants her money back for her layaway  She had six pieces in the layaway  She paid for the full layaway  only way to get her pieces out at the time  We ran off a very outdated system   and returned four of the six pieces  See   She shows me the receipts   M  ma’am the math is correct  The register isn’t going to mess something up like that  You started with six items  decided that you wanted to return four items and keep two items  which are in your bag  You can’t get money back for the full layaway unless you return the two items you kept  W  you aren’t understanding  M  yes I am  It’s simple math  I grab her four items she didn’t want and pulled the two out of her bag and set them on top of her bag  Now you started out with these six items right  W  yesM  and they totaled to  xxx xx  you decided not to get these four items so you return them for  I add the prices up plus tax   xx xx  W  that’s right M  okay so why would you think we owe you for these two items you’re keeping  W  ugh you don’t get it  Woman walks away and leaves  Husband grabs her bag and shrugs like he’s over it while apologizing and saying I’ll talk to her  Our store phone rings a few minutes later and it’s her  She then preceded to tell me she wants to talk this out like mature adults because she doesn’t want to call corporate and complain  She said she felt like I didn’t care that we ripped her off and that I didn’t want to be there and I was very condescending towards her  I stopped her and said I wasn’t condescending and that she didn’t understand at all and that she can’t get items for free which is what she was telling me she wanted  I told her I’m sorry if it seemed like I didn’t want to be there because I really didn’t as I did not feel good due to allergies  I told her I really wanted to be home sleeping because I was having a bad allergy attack that day but I couldn’t get anyone to come in and work  I told her I didn’t appreciate the fact that she couldn’t understand the simple math problem and to have her husband explain it to her better since he clearly understood what we were saying  I preceded to tell her to feel free to call my District Manager DM  at blah blah blah number because I would be calling her as soon as this conversation was over with and informing her of this issue  DM was called and I explained the situation  DM could tell just by talking to me on the phone that I didn’t feel good  I had worked for her for a few years by this point   I faxed her the receipt information so she could look at it all  The lady called her  minutes later and DM told her the same exact thing  DM calls me after the conversation and tells me to go home and get some rest once so and so from another store gets there in  minutes,4179,824
714,inlgej,1,1,Here’s how being nice enough to help customers while off the clock resulted in my first and only complaint Old story  but still makes me cringe  A couple years ago I worked in the retail area of a drug store  mostly in the cosmetics section It was a couple hours before closing  I  along with almost everyone else  had punched out for the day  I gathered my things from the back but had to do a little shopping before heading out      So there I was  still in uniform but very obviously off duty  with my shopping basket  jacket  and purse in hand  I’m picking out an eyebrow pencil when I get a text from someone I’m about to meet up with  so I reply  After maybe  seconds I start hearing sighs and whispers from  I think  an older mother and adult daughter a few metres away  But I’m not really paying too much attention to other customers  since right now I AM a customer  I continue texting when I hear the mother say         “EXCUSE me  is this product suitable for  x y z     so I  pocket my phone and answer their questions even though I’m not actually being paid to do so  and then we part ways  Eventually I end up just behind them in the checkout line  when this scene unfolds           “Can I speak to a supervisor ” The daughter   younger woman asks the cashier on duty  who also happened to be supervising covering breaks             Supervisor  “yeah that’s me  what’s up ”          Daughter  you’re gonna need to tell your staff that it’s extremely unprofessional to have PHONES on the sales floor ”      Both keep glancing back at me in line throughout this interaction           S  I’m the only person on the floor right now  everyone else is done for the day or on break            D  i know that’s not true  You should really pass this message along to whoever is in charge of YOU   because you’ve got staff on their phones instead of serving customers       S  there’s nobody working but me right now            Both ladies are not buying it and storm off after getting their receipt  I’m just standing there completely baffled as to how they can both ignore all evidence that they’re mistaken            I felt the need to text my manager in case either lady complained  which only resulted in the manager praising me for essentially working off the clock  and reassuring me that I had no obligation to ever help someone when I’m not being paid for it🤷🏼‍♀️,2402,502

717,in9dwg,1,16,Prejudice of some Quebec customers So I live in Montreal  Quebec in Canada  And this experience always stuck with me  It shows how strongly prejudiced some French Quebecers are  When I was  I had my first job working at Winners  a retail store with racks and racks of of clothes and shoes and all that jazz  When I started working there I was not good at french  raised in a completely English family  So I wasnt always able to help customers in French  But I knew enough french to tell them I would get them help from another employee  The customer thats always stuck with me came up to ask for help with her little boy  And when I told her Id be back with someone to help  She told me no  And asked me if I speak French  When I told her that I dont speak French well  she became incredibly upset  This mother in front of her kid felt it was appropriate to berate a  year old kid in front of everyone because he is English and isnt good at french  She told me I shouldnt even have a job and couldnt believe anyone would hire me  And forced me to get a manager to complain to them about me working for them  I was   First job  At this stage I had never really experienced something like this  That kinda fucked me up for a little while  Its crazy but its like that here  just based off the language we speak sometimes  I speak French now but i still dont think inexperienced  year old me deserved that,1428,273
718,in44kr,1,1,Customers and the stock room I have had to deal with customers that insist you check the stock room after you have informed them all you have left is on the sales floor  This store I worked at had expensive clothing and we had been hit hard by professional shoplifters  So there was a strict rule about leaving the sales floor we had phones on the sales floor to call back to the stockroom  managers office ect  So I would have a customer that did not believe we were out or limited on an item  I would call the stock room and the stock person would tell me what I already knew and told the customer  I tell the customer what the stock room manager said either we were out or what we have left is on the floor Then they insist I go myself and check the stock room  When I would explain how I was not able to leave the sales floor that is why I called for you  I would have to call a manager and get their premission to leave the sales floor  I can call a manager for you  Some get so mad before they storm away  A classic shoplifter trick is to get the sales person off the sales floor back in the stock room on a wild goose chase so they can steal hence the rules So usually after the customer storms away they find a manager and tell the manager you refused to help them  Then you are being questioned by a manager you explain we are out or all we have left is on the floor I called to check  Then the manager would have to call the stock room to verify my side of the story and prove to the customer what a sales person has already told them,1551,307
719,imyjoi,1,54,Had to find a severed finger This is from when I worked in a supermarket when I was  but I thought I would share  At our supermarket you can get joints of meat cut like ham or turkey  And my coworker was slicing some beef on this machine that had a spinning blade and she accidentally cut the end of her finger off and there was blood everywhere  The walls the floor just everywhere  She was then taken to hospital whilst me and the manager had to look for the end of the finger  When we eventually found it my MANAGER threw it away in the bin inside a plastic pot  We then got a call from the hospital that they wanted the finger but my manager had already threw it away in these trash bags  The trash bags belonged to a different department that cooked meat like chicken or ribs so they were full of grease and other disgusting stuff  My manager THEN ASKED ME TO SEARCH THE BAGS for the finger SHE threw away  There were  bags  So I search through all the bags for this olive pot and probably already crusty finger tip  I get to the LAST BAG and I find the pot but the finger is missing and as I am holding the bag open looking inside like     The finger is next to my hand sliding down the plastic  Thats when I realized I hate my job xThey didnt reattach the finger and I bought my colleague a condolence card and flowers for her lost finger tip,1359,265
720,imu8pz,1,17,Lady  I’m the wrong person  So  yesterday afternoon  I’m on cart duty since I work at a grocery store   This woman comes out of the store and stops to tell me  yes me  who is very clearly on cart duty  to tell me that she’s fed up with the store  and not coming back again  yada yada yadaTurns out that she had to remind the guy bagging her groceries several times to put the cold items together and he didn’t listen I should mention that he’s only been here for a week or so  give the guy some slack    She had to spend ten minutes rearranging her groceriesAll I told her was “I’m sorry to hear that” but she just breezed right over my attempted sentiments   well I tried  She was a nice lady too  So  yeah  I couldn’t decide whether she chose me to vent her feelings to  or she actually expected me to pass along her complaints  Oh well  I tried flagging down the store manager  but that never happened and by the time I saw her again today  I had completely forgotten  So  yeah  that’s my first tale from a grocery store girl on cart duty  I love it by the way  since I get to greet customers and get carts,1122,213
721,imrglp,1,7,A common mistake I see employees in smaller shops make is confronting suspected shoplifters inside the store after witnessing them conceal an item  Theres a reason big box loss prevention waits until  after  the suspect attempts to leave the store  or at least passes up the final point of sale  before stopping them  Up until that point  the suspect still has a legally reasonable argument that they intended to pay  They probably didnt  but they could either dump the merchandise  or change their mind and pay because they got spooked  Employees who are not loss prevention or management should approach only to offer assistance  That way  the suspect knows they they have been noticed by staff  Those with authority to stop suspects should watch them at all times to make sure they dont dump the merchandise  and then stop the suspect as they attempt to leave  Bad stops are a huge legal liability I live in an area that has a  bring your own bag  law  so they suspect has an additional excuse in that they can say they were just bringing their own shopping bag We all know they probably were trying to steal  but you must remove all doubt,1150,199

725,ildbsr,1,0,Asking for Opinions About a New Job Hey  So my friend and I are looking to start a company where we help Pest Control Companies to hire great people  Weve found that many of these company owners feel like there are few people out there who are good candidates for the job  which to be good at really just requires being nice to people when to go to their homes and being able to work independently and with your own schedule while youre out and about helping people with their homes   It also seems like a lot of really nice and considerate people are out there and feel like there arent that many good jobs  I want to try to help both groups of people by helping company owners orient their businesses towards what good people are looking for in jobs and help those good people find those jobs  All that said  my question is this  as someone in a retail position who has a lot of experience with customers  what is the   thing you would want to see in a new job offer For example  many people may want to see training and development opportunities within the company to get promoted raises more responsibility  Or someone may want to work somewhere that has more long term stability and can be a great career  Etc    Would love any and all thoughts  Thanks,1270,230

734,ik96fj,1,78,The “Pay It Forward” Chain  If there’s any formatting issues  I’m on mobile    so here’s the obligatory apology  For the past two years  I’ve worked part time as a cashier at a grocery store   I’ve been privy to several acts of kindness in the past  but there’s one instance that really stood out to me as particularly rare I remember it had been a fairly busy day  and I had already been at work for about   hours or so  I think it was one of those weird middle shift days because I don’t remember closing the store that night  Regardless  I was in a good mood and looking forward to my break  I was scanning the items of a lady in line  making small talk and smiling and generally trying to enjoy myself while making someone’s day a bit brighter  She looked to be fairly young and seemed tired  but was kind  and got about   worth of microwaveable stuff  I finished bagging her groceries  all of our baggers were busy  which was nothing new  so I was trying to be efficient  and she stayed at the end of the register adjusting her purse and wallet after paying  Since she was taken care of  I started ringing up the gentleman behind her  I don’t remember much about him other than the fact that he had quite a few small items and his total was about twice that of the lady before him  When he went to pay  the card reader gave him a chip error message  I directed him to try a few more times  since our machines are pretty sensitive and if the card is even a little smudged it won’t read it  Oftentimes when a person rubs the card’s chip between their fingers it will work  try that if you ever get the error message    However  when he tried it again  this time it registered as declined  He stepped away to call his bank and I saved his order so that I could move onto the next person  but I was stopped by the lady who had yet to leave  “I’ll pay for him ” She said  and she still looked    tired  Kinda done with life  That kind of expression  I could see a bit of hesitation there  and the guy had stepped away  so I said  “Are you sure  The total was  about   ” Again  this was about twice what Tired Lady had paid for her own order  I remember that she kinda paused for a moment  but she nodded  So I recalled the saved order and she payed for his items  I bagged them up  stuck the receipt inside one of the bags  and moved onto the next person in line  Tired Lady had just left the register when the guy came back with his card  and I got to tell him “Your groceries are already paid for  the woman in front of you took care of it ” I got a really weird look from this guy  Like  he looked like I told him I was keeping a tiny man in the register to organize the change  or something equally ridiculous  He looked    confused  “She did ” I nodded Confused Guy turned and looked at the guy behind him  then back at me  “Well  I guess I’ll pay for him then ” The dude behind him was not paying attention  and had only gotten a few items  so I just sort of blinked at Confused Guy and was like  alright then  I finished scanning the items  and Confused Guy stuck in his card  which was approved  guess he got his bank stuff worked out   About this time Distracted Guy realizes that I just handed him a receipt and is about to become Confused Guy    Before he can say anything  he’s told  “The lady ahead of me paid for mine  so I’m just passing it on  Have a nice day ” I’m just sort of standing there at that point  waiting to see what would happen next  Distracted Guy thanked Confused Guy and looked me dead in the eye and stated “Well  I’m paying for hers then ” This literally repeated three times down the line  and only stopped because no one else entered the queue  The last woman who had her groceries paid for by the person in front of her was a mom of two kids  and she was floored when the guy paid her   bill  She flipped when I told her she was the sixth person in a  “pay it forward chain” and I had a great time telling my coworkers about it when I went on break   I feel like there’s a lot of perceived peer pressure that is the incentive to be kind  And  for a few of them  I certainly felt that vibe But overall  it was just people paying it forward  And it was pretty cool  So thanks  Tired Lady  I hope you had a nice day after that  because you made a bigger impact than you realized,4383,836
735,ijnglr,1,10,Elderly guy made me sad  This happened a little over  weeks ago  but I still think about it  We get non English speaking customers all the time on the floor  and it can be a frustrating event for both of us  I usually make do by using google translate to help figure out what they want  but sometimes it ends up with me being scoffed at because I cant figure out what exactly they want  I was expecting it to be the same with this guy  but no  It seemed he had others try and help him  but they couldnt figure it out  so I stepped in  After him trying to describe what he needed  we finally figured out he wanted  a couple shelving units  When I took him to the aisle  he told me thank you  He looked like he was about to cry because he told me   this is my life   It just made me sad  It made me wonder how much he had been dismissed to react like that  He was quite elderly  I forget sometimes how patronizing these interactions can feel for the elderly  especially if English isnt their first language,1009,196
736,ij21a4,1,11,Thanks for threatening me  I’m keeping your stuff  This happened quite a few years ago but after reading some stories I thought I’d share  Near the end of the video rental era I worked at a game shop that was sometimes attached to a major video rental chain in the United States  Essentially  they would partition some of the stores and sell video games out of the other side One night I was by myself closing and a guy comes in with his wife to complain about a defective game  He had purchased Wii Play  a collection of mini games for Wii which at that time came bundled with a controller  The customer hadn’t brought the game disc which worked fine but complained the controller was defective and that he wanted a replacement  If we had a used copy on hand it wouldn’t have been a problem to swap out the bundle or just the controller but we actually didn’t have any used or new Wii controllers in stock  I explained to the guy I could get one from the closest store on my way in tomorrow morning but couldn’t replace it now  He saw that we had a new copy of Wii Play on display and demanded I exchange it from that one  This led to two problems  he had bought a used copy which was cheaper so he’d have to pay the difference and he hadn’t brought in the disc so I wasn’t even getting the old copy back I explained this to the guy and he started to lose it calling me names  threatening to report me  and eventually telling me I’d better do it or he’d “reach over the counter and beat my ass ” At this point some of the staff customers in the video store were taking notice but I offered calmly again to get the copy the following morning from our other location and then it occurred to me  I hadn’t asked if I could try out the defective controller to see what the issue might be  So  I asked him if I might take a look and maybe see if I can fix it  The manager at the video store is watching at this point and tells him to leave  The guy’s wife asks him to go and we get the obligatory “I’m never shopping here again  I spend so much money in this store   blah blah ” Since he’d put the controller down  I decide while he’s distracted to sync the remote to the demo WII behind the counter and start playing Super Mario Galaxy  I look over to him and ask “you didn’t know how to sync this to your system did you ” The dude freezes in his embarrassment and without collecting the controller the couple walks out  So I put the controller in the back and finish up delighted to have made that guy look like an idiot in front of the whole store  I wait a few weeks to see if they return and when they don’t  my manager eventually decides I deserve to keep the controller for the trouble  I did see them in the video store one more time a few months later and neither would make eye contact  I think the manager must have closed their rental accounts that night because I don’t think they ever came back again,2930,558

751,ignn32,1,19,When price matching fails For a while I was a volunteer working at a thrift that was run entirely by volunteers   This is the story of why I decided I would work there  I had selected what I wanted to buy and was waiting to buy it while the lady in front of me spoke to the cashier  She had about a dozen identical pieces of stemware  Half were marked    and the others marked      Now anyone who’s ever worked in a small thrift store knows stuff is dumped at the back door then sorted and put out the front and since it’s done by volunteers  it’s done someone erratically and it’s done as quickly as possible   So sometimes items from the same donation will get separated and priced by different people  which can result in identical items having slightly different prices   Apparently this is A Great Offense to the shoppers  Returning to our woman  she demanded to know what the cashier was going to do about it  The cashier looked straight back at her and said  “Yes  you’re correct some of them were mispriced  They should all be     However since they were put out with the wrong price  you can buy them for the price they’re marked ”Visibly annoyed the woman argued for a bit with her  demanding that they all be sold for    each  then stormed out leaving the glasses  The cashier company put them to one side to reprice the ones marked   Any other store in the same town would probably have sold all those glasses for at least a dollar each  We were a very cheap thrift store  we also had very little space  so we price things very inexpensively in order to move them as quickly as possible    Basically she didn’t buy them over a price difference that would have been about what one of one of them would’ve cost elsewhere  It was a great place to volunteer because we could do things like that and there was no “corporate“ for them to complain to  DEATH says the only bad part was we were not allowed to have a store cat,1953,364
752,igmnen,1,15,A woman is calling corporate to complain about me because I didn’t scan her coupon before ringing up any items This happened yesterday  so hopefully all of the details are still pretty fresh in my mind  To preface  I work for a chain that has a coupon available on their website  so many of my customers will pull out their phones for me to scan them  Usually they just set it on the counter  so I don’t often say anything about it  This woman was next in line after a particularly lengthy return  I had spent  minutes going over two receipts to figure out just what my previous customer was returning  and many items were rung up under the wrong department  So  some aggravation was justified  She gets to me  and I ask her to wait just a moment while I move the return items to the floor at my feet  She sighs  loudly  Not uncommon  people are dramatic  As I’m preparing to ring up her items  she pulls out her phone and makes no move to put any of her items on my counter  So  trying to be helpful  I say I don’t need the coupon just yet  “Well why didn’t you say something before letting me stand here with my phone in your face ” She retorts  I’m taken aback  even thinking at first that she has to be joking  She is not  I don’t remember exactly what I say next  however I know the woman responded with “at OTHER stores cashiers will scan the coupon” “Yes ” I reply  “I just need to ring your items up first ” FINALLY she gives me items to ring  But  I can’t ring anything just yet  She needs to find the slip she got from the fabric counter  Her fabric was still on the bolt  one again trying to be helpful  I ask if she had an employee measure everything out  as cashiers working up front cannot calculate what fabric will cost  It didn’t seem to bother her too much  however she was very short with me  She finds the slip  so I start entering the prices  Things mellow out until she points out that she is taking home empty fabric bolts for free and she already spoke with the woman running the fabric counter  Okay  fine  I think that’s allowed  Frankly it’s the first person I’ve ever seen do this  Still  I feel compelled to ask if she found the cart near the counter because we keep one over there for empty bolts to be moved to the back  At this  she rolls her eyes  flags over my manager  and asks if she can have the store’s number  He tells her it’ll be on the receipt  and she corrects herself  she wants the CORPORATE number  Mind  I’m still halfway through her transaction  so she has yet to pay and actually get her items  Finally it’s time for the coupon  I’m completely over it at this point  I’d been fasting for over a day  autophagy  and was hungry and cranky  I walk her through everything   not really caring how nice I am at this point  Not great customer service  but still  Somehow she finds no reason to be upset about my sudden attitude change  She leaves without any further fanfare  and I am reeling from the interaction from the rest of the night  Frankly  I’m still reeling  Working retail is great,3054,570

755,ig3q0x,1,11,Reading is Hard and Being Told Your Wrong is Harder I am a cashier at a grocery store and I was at the first lane  That means I always have a steady flow of customers  A customer was buying a lot of items for some place that required her to be tax exempt  It started off well  but then something didnt scan the  correct  price  The items were country ribs  She believed they were  Buy One Get One Free BOGO    just like the pork chops were  So I called the service desk and they told me to call the meat department  The meat department said that the ribs were on sale  but not BOGO  The lady insisted there was a sign above and below the ribs that indicated BOGO  She then told me to call a manager  but before I could call up the manager she dragged another poor cashier walking by into the mess  He had to run over to the meat section to find the signs  He did and took pictures proving the ribs were not BOGO  just on sale  The lady then said she would buy the ribs to not hold up the line bit too late for that   but will speak to a manager to get the  actual  price  Now items can be misplaced by both workers and customers  but that is why reading signs and not just the bold letters and pretty percentages is important,1227,237

768,id97su,1,18,On my second day of work  i accidentally withdrew  thousand dollars over  As im danish  and this took place in Denmark  i apologize for my English  and if some customs seems off So this takes place back when i was  years of age  and had just started my job as a cashier down at the local supermarket  We offered to withdraw cash to a certain point above what the customer had bought in goods  which converted was about a    On to the story This was my very second time working as a cashier  and the first time i had been a cashier without a trainer helping me  so i was still new to how the machine worked  A middle aged lady wanted to withdraw a   above the amount she had bought groceries for  and i happily complied  I pressed   in  and the machine for some reason didnt allow it  No problem i thought  I will just press   in again  And the machine allowed it The lady put in her card  paid for everything  and asked for the receipt  in which to my horror  said she paid   above  meaning i had to pay out over a hundred thousand dollars in cash  My dump ass immediately notified her  that we probably didnt have that much cash in the registry  and she was  for obvious reasons  rather frustrated  and demanded to see my manager while yelling and screaming at me  As this was my second day at the job  i were rather scared that i was going to get fired already Introducing Good Guy Boss  We will call him Mike Mike came down to assess the situation  and the customer and i explained the situation to him  all the while she was insulting me and basically demanding me to get fired   Which in hindsight  is probably not that unreasonable a reaction  Mike calmly looks her in the eye  and tells her he will fix it  and she can go home without a worry Hearing this  she began to scream at Mike  How could i ever possibly go home without a worry  when Ive just withdrawn a hundred thousand dollars in a supermarket  Are you stupid or something  This very clearly annoyed Mike  and he immediately replied   Yes  because i know how banks works  Now go home   He was very doing his very best to not start a yelling competition with the customer  She begrudgingly  after some more arguing  went on her merry way home At the end of my shift  i was called in by Mike to his office  where i was absolutely certain i was going to get the boot  What actually happened  ended up being one of my fondest memories from retail Basically  he immediately told me that it was not my fault  and it was her own fault that she had paid the hundred thousand dollars  as she could see on the screen the amount that was going to be paid  After that  we spent a solid   minutes laughing about how red her face had been  and the whole situation  I was also informed that the bank had straight up just not allowed the transaction  and it had been fixed within an hour or so of the incident I didnt end up getting fired  and ended up working there for a few additional years  but i will never forget the day in which in withdrew    in a supermarket  and how amazing a boss i had at the time,3122,575
769,iczvmd,1,69,You think you can steal   worth of groceries  Think again  So  I work at a reasonably large grocery store  I’m a manager for the front end  and have a pretty good eye for people stealing  Most of the time  though  they make it extremely obvious  Well  I’m up at my computer filling stuff out  which just happens to face the front door  Now  there are two doors to the store  one is used primarily for entering  while the other is used primarily for exiting  There are no signs anywhere  it’s just how people have collectively decided to do things  I look up  and see a lady with a FULL cart of food walking out the “entrance door” with everything loose and not in bags  Obviously  she’s stealing  Because we can’t just claim people are stealing  I immediately run to the back to look at the cameras  I see her walk to the bathroom  then immediately leave the store So I run  I see he standing a few stores down from work  and sprint over there  As I sprint  a car drives up and she starts unloading  Here’s the conversation  Me  meThief  tCar driver  CDMe  hello ma’am  I’m sorry  but you took this cart pretty far from the store  and I noticed you didn’t have anything bagged  Is it okay if I ask to see a receipt for your transaction T  oh  my sister has the receipt  I’m just loading things up to my Uber  Me  well  I will need to see a receipt otherwise I’ll have to call this in to the police  T  well then  I’ll call my sister to come back and show the receipt  Until then I have to go Me  Ma’am  I saw you on camera  and didn’t see you shopping with anyone  so if anyone has the receipt it’s you T  you can’t stop me from shopping  I bought these  okay   Continues loading items into the car Me  look  I saw you walk out from the bathrooms on camera  I saw you not pay  and I saw you walk over here  You need to give me these back or I will call the police  T  call the police  then I then went to the front of the car  and took a picture of the driver  and said “just so you know  what your ride is taking is over the amount needed to be considered a felony  So if you don’t want to be involved  I’d deny this ride ”CD  I’m not her ride  I’m her friend Me  well  as a friend  I would tell her to stop or else you’ll be involved with a felony  I went back and took pictures of the license plate  and pictures of the lady loading things into the car  Me  Just so you know  if you take these items  you and your friend will be convicted of a felony charge  T  well fine then  take your damn food back  But keep it in the cart because I’m coming back with my receipt and you’ll be sorry  You’ll be fired  You’re whole store will go down Me  If you come back with a receipt  I’ll gladly quit my job  Just do the right thing  She ended up giving back all the groceries and leaving  Surprise  She never came back  Stupid people  all I deal with are stupid people,2912,550
770,icxl3e,1,38,He liked his stolen watch so much  he came back to  buy  one  I used to work as Assistant Store Manager at a retailer of primarily watches and leather goods  At the particular location where I worked  we had three points of entry and never much staff working    depending on the time of day and the day of the week   The floor plan was set up so that  even if you were trying really hard  while also not helping any customers   you could barely see two entrances at once  Additionally  we only kept about   of our display product under glass  had no security guard  and our watches were in all the        range  It was an LP nightmare  and uniformed officers and detectives got pretty used to visiting at least monthly  if not weekly during busy shopping seasons  to take down theft reports and to follow up on them  It was stressful  tedious  and probably the worst part of the job One busy summer weekend day  when I was the only manager on duty  we noticed two watches were missing from their displays  so I had to step off the floor to review our security camera footage  We had something like  different cameras  and throughout my tenure at this retailer  I had gotten extremely proficient at snipping footage and capturing stills from our security cameras to provide to our LP team and the police department  So while reviewing the footage  I found some great angles of the culprit concealing watches and a pretty good shot of his face from when he entered the store  Needless to say  I knew what the guy looked like We informed the other retail location in our area that we had been hit  only to find out the guy had gone straight there  and  in the short amount of time it took us to figure out the watches were missing and review the footage  he had already returned one of the watches for store credit  Bold Cut to  About a month later  Im the only manager working again  and guess who enters the store  The shoplifter  He has returned to the scene of the crime  and guess what   Hes brought his fiancée  And guess what else   HES WEARING THE WATCH HE STOLE AND WANTS TO USE HIS STORE CREDIT TO BUY ANOTHER WATCH AS A GIFT FOR HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATE   Knowing that  the best deterrent to shoplifting is excellent customer service   this is something I learned in luxury retail that has worked pretty well in my experience  since you can keep an eye on things while also not being the jerk whose behavior is blatantly accusatory   I started helping the guy as he and his fiancée shopped  while also whispering to all my associates that we needed to watch him because he had stolen from us before He shops with us for about an hour  playing up how excited he is about his watch and about getting one for his associate  But folks  he had no clue who he was up against  Five years of improv training  anyone  On the sales floor Im all smiles  trying on watches with him and his fiancée  but in the couple of moments I get to walk away and hand them off to my associate  Im able to sneak off into the office to call the police and to confirm from my footage that this is   our guy By the end of the interaction  Im in the cash wrap with my associate who is gift wrapping the new watch  and our thief kind of corners us to see what were up to  We can feel him getting progressively more antsy    which is reasonable  since were taking our sweet time finishing the transaction as we await the cops  We assure him our system is just slow  and he sees my associate  clearly  trying to perfect the gifts bow After weve finished the transaction and handed him his ill gotten wares  we watch as he hurries his comfortably seated fiancée out of her chair so they can get the hell out of dodge  They exit  and we see him through our window fumbling with his phone to reactivate the app based  ride share moped they were using to travel  As hes doing this  the cops cruise by and stop just a few car lengths ahead  They get out of their car  and as they approach our door  I look at them with eyes wide  frantically pointing out our thief  They go and arrest they guy literally just as hes sitting down on the moped with his fiancée  who is visibly baffled by this development After all was said and done  the detectives come and commend me on doing their job for them  shoplifting arrests after the fact rarely happen  so they were pleased to close a case   and I end up looking the guy up  because   he gave his real name   for the transaction   and I find out hes some kind of jet setting yoga instructor  I did see his yoga instructor bio  who travels the world    and literally has Instragram posts of him   wearing his stolen watch    Clearly  the guy couldve afforded it but got some kind of thrill from shoplifting and returning to the scene of the crime  As for the fiancée  while I have sympathy for her  its probably better she found out about his kleptomania before saying  I do  Anyway  I left that job a few weeks later to work at another company  where Im happy to report that I havent had to file a single police report for the entire year Ive been there,5118,930
771,icuwbj,1,2,Can you buy this for me  I used to work for a retail store and due to where it’s location was it had a homeless camp inside a small patch of woods located right behind the store    Occasionally there would be homeless people frequenting the parking lot or even cone into the store    One day a homeless person comes in and starts looking around   One of the assistant managers  Bart  saw him and was available to help so he approached asking if he needed any help    The homeless guy was looking for a new backpack    Bart showed him where they were and assisted him until he left the store    In which Bart came up to the customer service desk where I happened to be and asked me to put a backpack he was holding behind the counter    I did so and being as I witnessed part of what happened and recognized the homeless guy I asked Bart what went on   Bart said that it took the guy a few minutes to pick out a backpack to his liking and as he saw the price asked Bart If he could buy it for him or lend him the money to buy it  Bart informed him that was not allowed by the company for employees to buy things for the customers   The guy then asked if he could hold the bag for him and he will be back later with enough money   I had to leave shortly after that but to my knowledge the homeless guy did not come back to buy the backpack,1343,278
772,icp0wn,1,24,A Disorganized Supplier Can’t Do Things Right  So where I worked  we would often order a good chunk of our plumbing supplies through a certain supplier  And each time I’ve dealt with this company  it’s been nothing but headaches and just stupidity on their end which I will tell about  The first time I dealt with them  my manager placed a order with them  and I had to receive it when it came in  However  when the ordered arrived  I didn’t get any info from them on how much they were charging us for the parts  so I had no idea what I needed to charge for retail  So I contact the company  go through their auto system  going through the prompts  until I get to their accounting department  I tell them what’s going on  saying I need the cost of our order  They tell me they don’t do that  I have to speak with their sales and orders department  and they give me the phone number  I call up Sales  give them the same story  They tell me they don’t do that  that I have to get the pricing from Accounting  I was confused  and told them accounting told me I get it from you  They told me they don’t do that  and give me the number to contact accounting directly without the auto prompts  So  I contact accounting  tell them I talked to sales  and they told me I get it through you  Accounting told me they don’t deal with that at all  it’s sales that handles that  To summarize the next little bit  I phone back and forth maybe  to  times  getting the same response from each department  I forget which department was on  but the person on the other end said to me “I can’t understand why they can’t just give you the invoice ” I was getting rather aggravated  and told the person on the phone “That’s what the other department is saying about you guys ” So the person says they’ll look after it  they contact the person needed  and ask for my email to it can be sent to me  I was glad I was finally getting somewhere  so I end the call  and wait  A day goes by  still no email  Fed up  I talk to my boss  asking if he has any contacts in this company  because I still haven’t gotten any invoice  He tells me he’ll contact his rep  and get me one  Less then a hour later  my boss hands me the invoice  Now here’s the kicker  I think close to  months pass  and I suddenly see a email from the supplier  and low and behold  it’s the invoice for the order  This is just a for shadowing of what this company is like  There is still more to this story  So maybe about two years ago  my boss wanted me to set up another order with the company  I get the order sheet the company provided  and make up a order  and send it through  Not long after  I get the confirmation email  with them asking me to look through the order  and make sure everything is looking good incase changes needed to be made  I look through it  and notice I made a few mistakes I needed to change  So I phone the name that was attached to the email confirmation  and explain to the person that there are mistakes  and just need to make a few changes  The person responds with “Well  the order is finalized  so it can’t be changed ” I was flabbergasted  I said I never gave the final approval like the email specified  I can’t remember the exact wording she used  But it was along the lines of its been sent to their warehouse for the workers to pick  and changing it would be tricky with their computers  To me  sounded like they could do it  but they just didn’t want to be bothered by it  Angry  I asked them if the order can be canceled  She told me it can be canceled  so I told her “Cancel it  I’ll redo the order  and send it back to you ” So she tells me she canceled the order  and I redo it and send it in again later that day  A week later  the order arrives  and everything seems good  But  a week later  another order arrives  After a while of looking through the items  I realize the second order was the order I had originally canceled  I call the company  steaming mad  but kept my cool  as I explain to them what happened  There was some small confusion on their end  because I used the same Purchase Order for my store for both orders  so I had to read them the different invoice numbers  and tell them which one was the one that was canceled  The person on the phone says “Ok  It doesn’t look like you were charged for it  We’ll give you our shipping account number  and you can just send it back ” So I seal the box  put a shipping label on it  and the next day  it’s on it’s way back to the supplier  It gets worse  So a few weeks later  the person at my store who handles the accounting called me to her office  and says she has two invoices from the company  with the same purchase order number on it  When I looked  I saw the supplier did indeed charge us for the canceled order  which was over  dollars  I told her hold onto it for now  and that I’ll call the company  So I call again  feeling like I’m about to snap  I go through the same process on the phone where I explain to them what happened  with them being confused with the two different invoice numbers  Finally  they get what’s going on  and tell me they’ll submit the refund  but it will take  months for it to be processed  “I told them that was completely unacceptable  That my company shouldn’t be out  dollars for  months  because of a screw up that happened on their end  They told me their accounts are swamped with issuing refunds  so that is the reason for the time  I roll my eyes thinking “Gee  I wonder why ” So  we wait  months  still no refund  I call them again  They tell me they refunded has been processed  and are just waiting for it to be signed off by the head of the department  and that we should see it soon  Not long after  I had to leave a few weeks because of surgery  When I come back  the accounting worker told me she still hasn’t received any refund  So I call them again  and get the same answer from them  that it just needs to be signed off  I tell them to hurry it up  because we are out of a lot of money  and they assured me they’ll get it to me soon  So I tell my accounting worker what went on  and she told me she’ll keep a eye out  Months go by  still nothing  I phone every few months  giving them hell  and with them apologizing saying they’ll get it out right away  Probably before Christmas  we still haven’t gotten the refund  and we are going on over a year since the original order  I contact the company again  doing my best to stay calm  because I know how it feels to get yelled at for something that doesn’t involve you  The women I speak too on the phone was really good  She was just as shocked and mortified about how long we’ve been waiting to get a simple refund back  She tells me she’ll contact the their rep for our company  and he’ll call soon to get this resolved  Guess what  never got any call  I’ve since been transferred to another store  so I don’t know the status if the money ever made it too us  But I told my boss at one point  that we should look into other suppliers  because this one can’t seem to do anything right,7111,1360

780,ibuabb,1,9,The barbeque and the credit card When I worked for this retail store  I got this one customer coming to me at my register   She had with her some stuff and a    barbeque grill   She also wanted to sign up for a credit card as well   I was excited that I would be making a killer sale and getting a CC signup   This woman  well call her  Betty   was told that if she got the CC  shed save  X dollars off of her purchase   I had to tell her that she would only get the discount if she qualified and she seemed ok by that so I walk her through the process  As I walk Betty through the process of signing up for the CC  she had a little trouble understanding some of the questions that the application asked her for since English was not her first language   After answering all the questions  she gets a printout stating that she was not approved for the CC and I had to tell her that   Betty asks if she would still get the discount and I said no because she was denied approval for it   She then looks at the grill and asks if she can get a discount off of the grill because it was missing the instructions  it wasnt  she was confused as there were three kinds of instruction booklets inside the grill    Betty then tells me that she knew someone who worked at the same store and said that they would let her use the employee discount and it was X    I told her that wasnt the case here and I couldnt do anything for her at this point   Betty changes her mind and decides against buying the barbeque grill because she would only buy it if she had the discount  we had other similar items for sale that were half that price and still worked just as good  I shouldve made that suggestion    She then asks me to put the barbeque on hold for her because she was going to call the number on the denial printout and talk to them so that she can get approved for the CC AND THEN come back and get her grill with her  X discount   After she left  I pushed the grill over to the customer service department and told them the whole story   After I clocked out for the day  one of the ladies from customer service told me that the woman never came back for the grill at all so they put it out on the sale floor I dont seem to think that Betty understood the whole  discount with the credit card signup  thing,2313,460

783,ib4qgi,1,31,Faith in humanity   dwindled Back in the mid s I worked in a local music store  instruments  not CDs   We had a nifty device that was basically a PC in a KIOSK with a touch screen  The PC contained thousands of songs worth of sheet music  You could pick the song you wanted in the key you wanted an it would print out to a lazer printer a few feet away  For the time it was magic   For the time it was also a bit ahead of its time as the touch screen wasnt too incredibly durable and stopped working after a while  There was a big thing with the company who provided the PC and kiosk but in the meantime we added a mouse and placed it on a small shelf right next to the PC along with a brightly lettered sign right at eye level above the screen that read  Touch Screen Broken   Please Use Mouse  along with an arrow pointing to the mouse   This same mouse that was about  inches away     Not a single day went by where there werent fingerprints all over the screen  thick greasy ones too   ewwwww  and at least one person would stop me with an incredulous look on their face to inform me  hey    this isnt working     It made me ponder  If we had our average customer in one room with the sheet music kiosk  and an adjacent room with a gorilla  a banana dangling from the ceiling  and a tire  rope  and stick   would the customer get the music first  Or would the gorilla get the banana first  Personally  I think the gorilla would get the banana then print out a song and leave  Possibly the gorilla would have to show the customer where the mouse was  After a few years of this it started to get upsetting,1628,306

793,i9ecg2,1,59,For the fifth time  no  you cant buy those  Pretty short anecdote from a terrible shift last week that was full of little annoying encounters throughout the day  A truly cursed shift  Sorry for mobile formatting For preface  I work at a small record store business  Were on a college campus  so with school coming into season  were getting my  favorite  type of customer  people coming in looking not for records  not for CDs  or even cassettes  but posters  which we have about  of  maximum  at any given time    nobody buys them   This one kid comes in  probably just moving into his dorm  looking for posters  At the front of the store  faced right towards the entrance  we have a display of the posters we actually keep stocked  Its even complete with a big sign that says  POSTERS   x price   in massive bold letters  Like I said  there arent many  but the ones we  do  have in this display are at least new  and feature currently popular artists  Kid walks straight past this  but somehow manages to find the ancient flip book of posters that we have wedged wayyy back in the corner of the store  Its essentially as close to being in our backstock area of the store as possible  with a wall partially blocking it off  because we dont stock these posters anymore  The only ones left are rolled up in the bottom rack  covered in dust  and the ones in the flipbook are just an old display  We cant remove them without taking the whole booklet apart  which nobody has even shown me how to do  so well only sell whatever posters still linger in the bottom rack  covered in multiple years of dust  but are easily retrievable  Anyways    this kid goes to the rack  Looks at the posters for a couple of seconds  Comes to the counter  and asks if were still selling the posters  I tell him yes  as long as he can find the poster he wants in the rack below  and not just in the flip book  because we cant remove the posters from the flip book  He says great  and goes back to the posters  About  minutes later  hes back  and lo and behold  he isnt holding a poster  I know whats coming   Can you get one of the posters down from the book or are you only selling the ones from the rack   I  deep internal sigh  and repeat that no  we cant get the posters out of the book  but he can grab any of the posters from the rack  or the display by the door  I am not kidding when I say he came back  more times  each with the same question in slightly different wording  before deciding to just go ahead and buy the   sticker hed grabbed  and leave  I cannot express to you how many times a very similar thing has happened  but this was absurd  How people fail to understand information after its been repeated this many times is beyond me  TL DR kid cannot comprehend that we can only sell him the posters I told him were for sale,2856,524

800,i70cwi,1,5,Learning a lesson from my couponing customers About a decade ago  fresh out of college  I was back home with my parents and working retail for a few months until getting a more full time career For reference  the store I was working at was the merchandise store for our local NFL team  and often ran specials and cross promotions with other local businesses A few weeks before christmas I had a few ladies come in to make a large purchase and paid all in   coupons  I was actually surprised the system rang it up  but it all worked and they got a few hundred dollars of stuff virtually free  Purely out of curiosity  I asked them how they got so many coupons and they just cryptically replied  frozen vegetables  When I get home I look it up  The coupons came from a supermarket promotion  buy  items off of a list and get a  dollar coupon  One of the items on the list was frozen vegetables  which often went on sale for   each  Close to a solution  but not quite there  Then I found it  The grocery store also had matching on manufacturers coupons under    And newspaper coupons for  cents off on this brand came up pretty often Did you know you can buy bulk clipped coupons online  For about  bucks I got  coupons for frozen vegetables on Ebay  Over a couple of weeks I  bought  hundreds of pounds of peas  carrots  and corn without paying a cent  and getting coupons for sports gear with every checkout  I ended up filling  freezers at home and still donating a ton to the local food bank and my old fraternity house  Two days after I quit my retail job  I strolled back in with a fat stack of coupons  I was able to finish my full Christmas shopping list for my entire extended family  plus get myself a   dollar leather jacket  basically for free  And my whole family ate healthy for months afterward,1835,337

802,i6w9qk,1,2,My Self Respect goes down the toilet This story is going to have some rather graphic descriptions so continue reading at your own risk  So Ive mentioned before in other posts that I used to work at a Gas Station years ago   The one I worked at was right off the freeway and given how we were the only major city for miles we were normally pretty busy  and unfortunately some days our restroom would reflect that  Inside the restroom there was an additional light switch  that when flipped would turn on a blue light outside letting us know that someone felt the room needed cleaning  If you saw it on you were suppose to go check and clean or restock whatever was needed  We also cleaned it at the end of the day regardless  Now Ive seen some bad messes in there  weve had construction workers use it as their personal shower before  someone who  well  didnt make it in time  And the of course the evidence of drug use you find in there as well All that to say Im not squeamish about what Ive had to clean up in there except for one time  That time was any normal day  started my shift early and everything went normal  Had just a couple hours left when our assistant manager asked for me  She said a customer just came out of the restroom and  said there was an Issue  All he sad was it wouldnt go down and he left  She looked inside and said she tried using the plunger but it wouldnt work and asked told me to take care of it  When I asked how she handed me a trash bag and a pair of thick rubber gloves  they went all the way to my elbows thankfully  Knowing my fate was sealed I walked over and opened the door  The smell that came from that toxic cesspool was downright awful  no human being could have done this  I opened the lid and start retching  The only thing keeping my stomach contained was the knowledge of where Id be putting my face over to do so  I open the trash bag and just reach in with my thankfully gloved hands and pull out this sin to humanity and in the bag it goes along with my gloves  I take this and sprint out of the store  back exit  and throw the unholy abomination in the first dumpster  I then run to the next dumpster and settle my stomach there  I slowly walk back into the store and my assistant manager just says go home when you feel you can drive and Ill punch you out when your shift is over  I nod and without a word go to my car and drive off  Needless to say I spent the rest of the day in the shower Just as a final note I dont resent the assistant manager for this  she had her reasons for not cleaning it herself,2581,498

807,i63z5e,1,0,A short and funny tale I recently spoke to a former co worker at a big chain pharmacy and we were discussing dummy employees  She still works there so I was treated to the following story    A shift supervisor was in the backroom when the door alarm for the entrance to the sales floor went off  An apologetic customer told the supe that the employee up front was in trouble and laying passed out on the counter  When the supervisor got up front  the cashier was asleep on the photo counter  but not really in trouble   just sleepy  The supervisor began ringing up the customers while the cashier pulled herself together  Except she then put a few chairs together and curled up for a nap  while the supervisor was still ringing customers It seems she did claim she was having some sort of stress emergency but was somehow not fired  and is now wondering why shes not scheduled more,889,160

809,i5zyco,1,53,But I want my money back My work only provides a refund if the customer brings back the same card used to make the purchase  for security reasons This happened a couple of years ago  A lady came in and wanted to return something   and decided to stand there on her phone messaging someone throughout this whole transaction When I asked if she had the same card   she said  no   my daughter paid for it   I informed her    that we need the same card   otherwise I can give her a store credit   no   I want my money back I informed her again    what our return policies are   and what we can offer as an alternative  I also informed her that she had another week available to return the item  I cant come back another day   I need to do this today  I want my money back So I repeat to her    that if she wants it done today   I can give her a store credit  At this point she is still on her phone  and she looks up   yes okay fine   do that  As shes on her phone  I repeat myself again    to make sure she knows what Im doing Me   okay so Im going to return these items and put the money on store credit   is that okay   The lady   still on her phone   doesnt bother to look up at me and says  yes thats fine  So I return the items and complete the transaction  The whole time she was  of course   on her phone  Me   okay so here are your receipts and your store credit Customer  finally breaking eye contact from her phone    I said I didnt want a store credit I once again repeated    what the return policy is   and told her that I asked her if this was okay and she agreed  but I said I want my money back I called for my manager and walked her through the whole ordeal  While I was explaining everything to the manager  the customer was once again standing there on her phone  The customer ended up leaving and coming back about  minutes later with her daughter  who was in the Shopping Centre the whole time     We ended up putting the refund onto the daughters card  This whole situation could have been avoided if she had just asked her daughter to come to the store to begin with,2135,407
810,i5wxtj,1,50,Man screams at me because we dont hold meetings about him specifically Back when I worked at a gas station and was a new hire I had a lovely interaction A part of the job at the cash registers was that you had to promote sales of whatever was on offer infront of your register  usually some cheap candy  cookies or chewing gum  You get the idea This man comes in and I go through the normal interaction  confirming the pump he got gas at  asking for his bee themed reward card  etc When I asked him if he would like to make use of our offer for a packaged cookie for € he turns irate He starts yelling about how we always offer them  why we still offer it to him specifically and why we dont discuss that we shouldnt offer then to him because hes not interested  ever I was a bit shaken after the interaction because it was my first week and I was still actively trying to do the extra sales   weeks later Ive already learned that noone does the extra sales and management doesnt really care and that the customer is definitely not king Queue angry man There was a sizeable line at my register and I didnt much try to speed things up  By the time the man is next in line hes fuming and barely talks  so I take my sweet time bring extra super friendly  going through every line of interaction   asking for the pump number   asking for his rewards card  offering him a reward card with a in depth explanation of why he should get one  asking him if he was sure he didnt want a card  asking him if he wanted to join the savings program for whatever crap we were peddling to save for with stamps  explaining the entire program and the wonderful product he could get  asking him if he would like to make use of our special offer with regards to whatever was infront of our register and telling him how much he could save  finally he gets to pay and I offer him his receipt   give him a very friendly goodbye whilst he is raging internallyOther customers and my colleague were pissing themselves  the man never spoke up againGlorious,2065,379
811,i5uyii,1,9,Ill remember this for years to come Its hot out where I live right now  c or f  we are not used to that  usually summer is   with rain  and that reminded me of an old story A couple of years ago I worked in a store at a trainstation without airconditioning  It was summer break and we had a particularly quiet day  We were bored out of our minds  melting into the counter and eagerly waiting for any customer so we could finally do something  Now this was a trainstation  so people usually come in all hurried because they are going to catch miss their train  But then this guy came in and told us he missed his train and now he had to wait an hour because the next train   minutes  had been canceled  The platform was already full of people and he knew in  hour he had to cram himself into an overfilled train while it was cooking outside and our trains dont really have quality airconditioning  He looked a bit bummed  So we chatted with him for a while  suggested some books and magazines he might like  He was shopping a bit and nobody came in for over half an hour  We were eating cookies and we offered him some  It was genuinely nice to have a gentle soul in our shop  So after  minutes he went to slowly catch his train   minutes later he came back with ice cream  two spoons and two cold drinks  gave it to us and left to catch his train  We felt like the luckiest people in the world  And Ill remember this random act of kindness for a long time to come,1487,286

815,i5amom,1,2,My fault for letting a customer drop a TV  A customer I was trying to help buy a TV dropped the TV in front of me and left me there for a manager to see First time posting here and on mobile so please be with me as I cant sleep without getting some answers So I have been working at a decent wholesale club chain for not very long  It has been a really bad week  one bad event leading to the next each day today but I think this is one of the worst things you can do I had just clocked in and was moving some carts around as thats what Im supposed to do when a call comes into meet a member at the front desk  I get there and the lady at the desk asks me to help a customer out with getting a TV  Everything was going fine as I spoke with the customer saying how it was a good deal and all of that  the supposed buyer being a middle aged black woman  as the clerk searched for the tv remote We start proceeding to the TVs once the remote had been found  Now Im not exactly the muscular type  Im pretty skinny really  but I have been pushing carts and have helped move pallets of stuff in the back  I was expecting the TV to be relatively smaller  maybe around  inches or less  in the box or something like that but at the that much of a discount it just makes sense now  The TV was about  feet above ground  appearing to be mounted to a stand  At this point it would have been a good time to ask for some help but the customer then starts asking me if Im new to this in which I reply yes to an extent  She then suggests she get on a roller I had brought to bring the tv and does so saying  please dont let me fall    From here I start considering calling for some help so I can help her with the TV but she was still in the roller so I couldnt let go of it  She then finds out that its not mounted to the stand but placed on it and starts pushing it to the side for whatever reason The next thing I know it  the TV hits the stand  and she screeches  The TV was completely fine before  but now its got a good amount of scratches on the screen  Im dead pale at this point  which is interesting because I have been baking in the sun the entire time Ive been working there so Im really tan  Im thinking about how this is the worst thing that I could happen  in pure shock  and in the middle of that shock I try to get up there  trying to prevent any furthur damage  Dont let me fall   She says  as shes now just trying to come down from the ledge  I try to keep the cart stable while barely holding this TV now  She comes down and I get up to set it upright and it doesnt  I then call for back up and in the middle of all of this she saying Im sorry and that shell  be back  or something of the sort and Im still there holding the TV for an excrusiating  minutes as another guy  better built then I am  finally comes down and manages to get the TV away from me by himself  He calls the manager and I tell him the customer made the TV fall just as this manager comes around and he tells her everything He then tells me to find the woman as we  or rather I  didnt know at this point she really didnt buy the TV yet  and tell her to come to the front  Im shaken ad I dont know what this would do to me but I look around and find her on the OTHER side of the store  I come up to her and ask if she bought the TV in which she says she doesnt   Youre not going to get in trouble are you   She asks   I dont really know  I say  as that just comes out of my mouth  probably not he best thing to say looking back at it now  She then asks for my name for whatever reason and asks for my phone number but I tell her they may need her in the front  She then wants to give her phone number to me but I believe I tell her again they may need her in the front and I leave for the front desk  I look around for the guy with the TV before finding the manager in front  I ask her if the customer needed to come up and she says she didnt  How embarrassing   I thought my interaction with the woman would end there but just as I was helping with an order I hear from behind me  Im pissed now   and  Oh Im really pissed now   And low and behold its the same woman from earlier  She was heading to the front desk and we made eye contact and I turn away as I just needed to take a break  She then proceeds to go the front desk  I head outside and that was that Thank you for reading up to this point  Looking back at it now I definitely Ill call for back up when I really need it but I really want to know what others think about this situation as I havent really told anyone close to me about this situation yet  The big question being  is it my fault  What do you think the managers will think of me,4738,962

819,i4vkyr,1,0,Tired of  Get so many customers to sign up for use the rewards app   I work at a   We are launching some new functions to the app soon and so of course  we got a letter down the chain saying all employees need to get to   of customers using the rewards  phone number or the app  This isnt terrible of an option  besides the fact the rewards do nothing for anything outside of food and drink  a few coupons for specific beers and tobacco products in specific amounts  but nothing general   So on third shift when everybody is just grabbing a beer or a cigarillo pack of smokes    there is no reason to have the rewards app  Yet the corporate guys above the franchisee breath down all our necks to pester everybody to sign up  amp  xB I honestly dont mind my job  I like the customers and love the tasks  when I get to do them without interruption   but I feel blah at being pushed to ask if they have the app want to sign up  then give them a sales pitch until they agree    Especially if there is a line and Im trying to help every customer as fast as I can  amp  xB Needed to get that out before this new app stuff launches,1149,209
820,i4qa9t,1,3,Got in BIG Trouble I work at a gas station  and recently we’ve been having problems with the registers  they’re fine now Yesterday night while me and a coworker were changing shifts  the register wasn’t letting either of us log in  I had logged out on mine  and kept saying that someone was already logged in  I called the help desk and we tried rebooting it and such  The guy asked me to get my manager  who wasn’t at the store at the time  it was am and she came in around am   to use her code to see if it would let her log in I should’ve called her  problem is  she gives me really bad anxiety  She scares me and I was afraid she’d get angry that I was calling her so late I wasn’t sure what else to do  so my coworker and I figured we’d close the store  She couldn’t ring people out and we thought it was a good idea at the time  but it wasn’t This morning my manager questioned me on why I thought it was a good idea to close the store rather than call her  I froze  I couldn’t speak  I have social anxiety and when I know I’m in deep sh t I can’t talk She told me I should’ve called her  or why I didn’t as I had recently talked on the phone with her an hour ago and that we’d both be getting written up due to what we did What I did was stupid  and I feel really bad because it was my idea  I feel like I don’t have a good relationship with my manager and it doesn’t help when I do stupid things and make it worse,1433,285

822,i4d2wg,1,5,I Know You Can Read The Sign I’m out of work rn because my indoor mall in CA in temporarily closed  but a few posts on this thread reminded me of this My store has two entrances  both with gates that close from top to bottom  Corporate is insisting we keep both entrances open  use Gate  as an entrance exit so the metering associate can keep a headcount  use Gate  so customers can window shop while they’re in line  They gave us a flimsy ribbon to string across the second entrance to keep people out  and a tall sign that says in bold lettering on both sides “PLEASE USE OTHER ENTRANCE EXIT”In the short month we were reopened before getting shut down again I’ve witnessed the following happen at Gate    Multiple customers sneak under the ribbon to get inside the store without having to wait in line  Then complain and fight with staff when asked to leave and please wait in line    Customers approach the sign  take a moment to read it  look around  and proceed to duck under the ribbon to exit    Staff ask customers headed out Gate  to please use other exit  customers blatantly ignore staff or respond with something along the lines of “don’t tell me what to do”  Customers that waited in line will sneak multiple friends through Gate  once they’re inside so their friends don’t have to wait in line And my personal favorite       The ribbon is taped to two poles on either side of Gate   Seeing this  customers will karate chop the ribbon down during their exit so they don’t have to duck underneath  and then will leave the broken ribbon on the floor for the staff to reluctantly retape  Hoping corporate lets us keep Gate  closed when we reopen,1694,302
823,i40r7y,1,79,Customer complains about us not having enough of a product  but wont place an order  ShortI work at a smallish store thats basically for farmers  We have fencing and feed and stuff  This customer who Ive seen before several times comes in and asks me if weve gotten a pallet of rabbit feed in  thats  bags   lbs   I check with our receivers and they say that we dont have any in the back  I check in the spot on the floor and we have about  bags  Rabbit Guy says he needs a whole pallet since theres a   discount for  bags  He says he has been waiting for  months and we havent gotten it in and wants to know when its arriving  I explain to Rabbit Guy that the cashiers can see if its on order  but not what day it will arrive  I then tell him that he can place an order  A special order like this is held in the back and the customer is called when it arrives  The waiting time for special orders is   weeks  After I tell him this he just walks out of the store My main frustration is that we probably got  different pallets in the time that he was waiting and he just missed them being full  If he had placed an order before he needed them  we could have had it for him  and he wouldnt have needed to even pay in advance,1253,248
824,i3vy5n,1,23,She needs to apologize   Mere hours ago  I had just started my shift for the day and went to my stores front register  Not even  minutes in  and Ive encountered the first rude person of the day  Most arent reddit story worthy and I tend to brush things off  but this was something that made my coworkers laugh  On mobile so apologies for anything misspelled This older lady comes up and places her things on the counter  I barely get a  hello  in before Im cut off and it begins Me   myself  C   older lady  M   managerC   places our stores brand of allergy medication on the counter   boxes to be precise   you all normally give me   off on this   As she holds up one Me  unsure as to what she is referring to  pardon  C   you  all   raising her voice  give me   off on this Me  still visibly confused  is there something wrong with the packaging  I dont see a sticker on it for a markdown C   no  Its buy one get one half off  Me  finally understands what she is referring to  ok  did you not want to get a fourth to complete the two buy one get one half offs or were there no more of the size you were looking for   Need to ask  cant just give out discounts on a whim C   I dont want any more than these three  You never have enough on the shelves  Well that answered bothy concerns  She didnt want to mix and match  and it seems like we might not have any others on the shelf from her choice of words Change the price of the cheapest not coming up with the half off already and applied the    ring up her other items  asked is she wanted to use her saved up store currency  she paid and the receipt printed C   was that the total after the senior discount   That was today  The days just blur together  especially as of lately I even told her the total as she was watching the screen  not sure as to why she didnt say anything  before  she paid Me   ah  sorry maam  I didnt even realize that was today  Let me call up a manager to post void this and Ill re ring everything  It will only be a moment longer  As I call the manager  I can see as she rolls her eyes in quite a large ark and huffs every other second  Manager comes up  voids it  I re ring all the items by typing in the upcs on the receipt instead on unbagging everything  change the price once more  apply the discount  use her currency once again  and a good   off  She pays for it and leaves Paid it no mind  rang up other customers happily and didnt think anything about how snippy she was Until she called Maybe an hour later is when it rang  I answered the phone  cheerfully recited the company words and then recognized her voice immediately C    let me speak to the manager  Responded politely and placed her on hold  paged for an available manager to answer the call and went right on back to working the register From maybe   feet away  I can see the manager pick up the phone  Couldnt make out words but after long periods of silence the managers responses sound like a mixture of cheeriness  direct  and also a little snippy  A few minutes pass of what seemed like them going back and forth  the manager hangs up the phone and walks off  Didnt want to ask what all that was about and minded my own business without question  It wasnt until I called for something at the register that she turned around and started to inform me of the call  without even being questioned about it M   so you know that call that came in a little while ago  Me   yes  it was the lady I helped earlier  Let me guess  it was a complaint on me wasnt it M   you are correct  The manager went on by saying how the lady had started off the complaint that I was unbelievably rude to her  and she demanded that I apologise to her and that I need to be reprimanded for my behavior  Not once did I raise my voice or go anywhere from a cheerful tone  However  the manager had told the lady that she did not believe her complaint  that she couldnt see me being rude or that I had to give an apology in the first place when she knows I did nothing wrong The customer didnt tell her anything about the transaction  so when I explained what exactly happened  my minor mistake at the end with the senior discount for the first transaction  and the customers responses attitude to things  it just got the manager laughing  And the assistant store manager behind her was laughing as well They both agreed that nothing in there showing that I behaved as she had stated  But I am expecting her to call the corporate number and we might need to speak with the district manager,4614,835
825,i3s76d,1,6,Its always an eventful night on the graveyard shift This happened a couple years ago when I was the main graveyard shift manager at my pharmacy retail store  We normally have a security guard during this shift because    our store was in a crime filled city and    lots of people tweaked out on meth  heroin  etc  liked to come in and steal or threaten to hurt us during this time of night  The guard on shift this particular night was new to our store and I had been communicating with him the codes we have  our routines  and pointing out any regular thieves that came into the store  It was during one of these conversations I was having with him that I noticed a woman come inside the store  She looked extremely familiar  but I could not remember whether I knew her because she stole or because of something else  We both decide to watch from afar to see if she was stealing  The woman had walked down an aisle that held all of our seasonal summer items like pool toys  sandals  and sundresses  We kept watching from a good distance away  but then I turned my head to answer a question the guard had  When I turned my head back to look at what the woman was doing  she was wearing one of our sundresses and was proceeding to take her pants off underneath the dress  I was a little shocked at what I was seeing and it took a second before I yelled out  HEY   The woman now had taken her pants off and was trying to reach the front door to leave  The guard stopped her by blocking her path  which he technically wasnt supposed to do according to store policy  and demanding that she take the dress off immediately  She starts screaming obscenities at him but the guard doesnt budge  I call  because it looks like the woman is going to start assaulting the guard  She is screaming so loudly that the dispatcher can hear her through the phone over my voice  While waiting for police to come  the woman decides to give the dress back since the guard still isnt budging and letting her leave Now during this whole time weve dealt with this crazy woman  one of my coworkers had been outside taking a smoke break  He walked inside the store just as this woman was attempting to put her pants back on underneath the dress  She then throws the dress down onto the floor and then proceeds to take her shoes off and hurl them several aisles over  She then leaves barefooted and still screaming random obscenities out into the night  Police showed up not long after  but the lady was already gone Afterwards the coworker who was on a smoke break comes up to me and tells me that he got a full view of the womans   lady parts   as she was putting on her pants  Turns out the woman was going commando  It didnt phase him though  he previously worked at an adult store  and got a good laugh out of it  And before anyone asks  we did NOT keep the dress she wore  We just took inventory of it so that it could be thrown out for sanitary purposes  The woman had come in before to steal  which I remembered after this ordeal unfortunately  but she never did anything that crazy up until that point  She came in multiple times afterward  but I can leave that for another post if anybody is interested,3207,590
826,i3qs1l,1,24,“You need to go back to elementary school ” The other day I was working the closing shift  so  to   pm  Our store closes at  but of course people LOVE coming in at the very last second  My last customer came up to my register and I did the usual “How are you today  Would you like all your items in a bag ”  I scan her items and tell her the total  I ask her for cash or card and she went with cash  Now  I will be the first to tell you that math is not my strongest subject  Yes I’m  years old and yes I still need to use a calculator for most things  So I whipped out my calculator and just subtracted the total from what she gave me and didn’t pay too much attention to the numbers because I knew the calculator would get it right  I then hear her say something about  cents  I look up at her ask her to repeat herself and she goes on to say “My change back is  cents  You had to use a calculator for that    ” And I was just like “oh ok  yeah  cents”  that’s also what the calculator said   I continued to get the change while she began to say “WOW that is pathetic  You really have to use a calculator for THAT    I’m a teacher and that is so sad  You really need to go back to elementary school  that is PATHETIC ”  I just gave her the change and said have a good night  I think she was having a bad day and for some reason felt that belittling me would make her feel better,1394,285
827,i3pvus,1,2,Angry Potatoes Lady before i get into it  here’s our cast  RC   Rude Customer    FC   Friendly Customer  RC’s friend     CSL   Customer Service guy    Me   me   FM   Front End Manager  only mentioned   OM   Other Manager mentioned cuz I don’t really know what part she’s the manager for   For a bit of backstory  it was pretty early in my time as a cashier  so I was still learning how to do certain things and what I was allowed to do by myself and what I wasn’t  So anyway these two elderly ladies  RC and FC came in through my line and RC sets her stuff down on the belt and a couple other things on the counter with a slip for a rain check  I don’t really know how many stores actually do rain checks  but basically they’re just slips of paper that we give the customer if we don’t have something that’s marked down for that week that they want in stock and then they can come in and get that thing for the price on the slip whenever we do get it back in stock  Anyway  as I’m ringing up RC’s stuff  her potatoes end up coming up as the wrong price on the screen  She points it out in a fairly rude tone  but I say nothing and call someone up  We were pretty busy from what I saw  at least mine and a few other lines  including self checkout  so it took CSL a bit longer to get over to me cuz he had a bunch of other stuff he had to do  so I just continued ringing RC out until he came over  In the midst of me ringing out the other groceries RC had  she let out one of those really annoyed sighs that sound like you have something in your throat  looks around and then at me and says “Can’t you call over FM or OM ” I was just barely clocked in  I didn’t even know if either of them were that day  so I just shrugged and said “I don’t know  I just got here ” Her friend  FC  told her to calm down cuz I had my “I need help” light on  A few moments later  CSL walks over and asks what was wrong  I told him the potatoes came up as the wrong price and didn’t know how to change it  As CSL is voiding off the potatoes  RC asks him “Isn’t FM here ” He says “No  she just left about an hour ago ” “Well what about OM ” “I don’t know if she’s working today  I haven’t seen her ” to which RC replies with “Well is there anyone here who knows what they’re doing ” And CSL just goes quiet and fixes the price on the potatoes  I then tell him  I still need him cuz I have a rain check for RC  so since I didn’t know if I was allowed to register rain checks into my computer or not  nor did I now HOW to yet  he took the slip and the minced garlic and typed it in as a rain check  Everything went fairly smoothly after that  I rang out FC and they paid and left  though CSL was obviously very hurt about RC saying he didn’t know what he was doing  especially since you don’t just become CSLs for not knowing how to do the job and at one point RC came back through a different day and said “I’m not going through HERE” as if I did something wrong when literally all I was doing was what I was told to do by the people who trained me  I have a few more if anyone wants to actually hear them  but they’re WAY shorter  so if I do end up posting them  they’ll prolly be put into one post,3180,656
828,i3c72s,1,30,A Random Act of Kindness So  my last night at the store  I had two customers in at the same time  This woman came in and was getting water  Gatorade  Powerade  stomach medicine  and was on the phone with someone explaining that our store does not carry baby aspirin  She waved the customer behind her to go ahead and explained that she had to find a substitute  because no one else was open that time of night  true  The customer behind her  a man  looked at her items as he handed me his items  two  oz beers  and told me  quietly  to ring up her items as well  So I did  and he paid for it  Then  after I bagged his beers and handed them over he asked me to print a receipt for the paid items and put it with them after I had bagged them  Which I did  He walked off as I was bagging the items She came up to me  flustered  and said   He said he paid  For my stuff   As I was showing her the receipt he left the store   But  but why  I shrugged   I dont know   I said honestly   Its not like he  told  me why  after all    But  if you see him again  you should say thank you  Were you able to find the medications all right  This may be short  but I thought it was too good not to share  People  can  be nice and considerate towards each other  and I think that sometimes we just need a reminder of that,1322,257

831,i2usvk,1,54,Yell at me  no refund for you  This is my first post in Reddit so hopefully this is the right place Also English is my secondary language and Im on mobile  and Id classify this as long  so  sorry   Ok so  I work in a pretty popular online shopping store as a customer consultant service  one that shall not be named  Now  this really happens to all of us  almost daily  but this one I had just yesterday and I think its worth a share Whenever someone orders something and doesnt get it or returns it  of course theyll get a refund  No matter how rude they are  its their money after all  This one was a special case though CS   CustomerMe   me  A customer calls and I start with the basic  Hello and welcome to Blah  my name is Blah  what can i do for you    and without even finishing the sentence  the CS goes yelling  WHY HAVENT I GOTTEN MY MONEY BACK YET   ITS BEEN SO LONG YADA YADA YADA   Im used to these customers but I get so angry every time  I keep my cool tho  and I go to the order to check why he hasnt gotten his refund yet  While checking  I saw that he returned the item almost  weeks ago  it takes  week  seldom  to get a refund   and that this was the fourth time he called us about this  the colleagues always told him to wait and be patient and so on  I thought  Okay  Id also be a tad angry with this   but then while checking  I noticed that he paid with Coupons  Alrighttttt  Side note   coupons here are given either with special offers  buy  EUR of this  get  EUR coupon   either  usually  theyd be given to the customers from the customer service  us  as a way of apology or compensation when a package is delivered late or badly  or in general about other problems  and coupons can only be used one time and they are non refundable  since theyre considered as a discount for future orders  We also have a way of checking how it was given to them  I dont know why the colleagues kept telling him to wait  They either did not see that it was a coupon  or were avoiding confrontation  I inform the CS that he paid with coupons  and since theyre for single uses  he will get no refund  I explain it pretty politely and clearly  He doesnt understand  I tell him that since its a coupon and it counts as a discount  the item is considered to be a  gift  of some sort  Since he technically did not pay for it  he wont get money from us  After a lot of explaining and him yelling at me the whole goddamn time  he probably ran out of excuses as I explained the gist of it numerous times  he said something along the lines of  I have no idea what these even are  This is the first time Ive heard of a Coupon   Bad move  bro  I checked to see how he got the coupons and all of them were given to him from the Customer Service  and were obligated to send a confirmation email each time  so I knew this was a straight up lie  He just desperately wanted those   EUR from us  I proceed to inform him this  and told him that I have numerous  confirmation emails in front of me  and I can gladly send them again for him to see  He pretends its a misunderstanding and that he knows what the Coupons are now  Sure  Thing is  I now notice that the CS was actually abusing the system  so to speak  as hed call for extremely minor inconveniences  and ask for a coupon from us as compensation for the trouble  Things like  Why is this particular thing in your website so hard to find  The customer should have it easy  I demand a compensation    We always leave notes after every call and say what the call was about  so I was reading the notes my colleagues left from previous calls  I was smelling a Karen  Except it was a man  A Bob  Anyways  I was getting tired of repeating the same things so I basically told him that we can talk all day but theres nothing I can so as the system wont allow it  Sure enough that shuts him up and we end the convo  Since he was abusing the system and customer service  I proceeded to report him to my superiors for this  which meant no coupons anymore  and we were allowed to hang up if he wouldnt cooperate   Normally the client has to hang up  we have this dumb  Disconnect Rate  that we have to take care of   Furthermore  I actually COULD make an exception and just put another Coupon on his account on that same value  but he yelled at me all the time  so of course he wasnt getting it  The CS wouldnt know this  but I did and it gave me a lot of satisfaction  Basically  whether we  refunded  the coupon or not was entirely our decision  and it was kind of an unwritten rule to  refund  it if the customer is nice and genuinely made a mistake didnt see it  but if theyre bitchy or Karen y to us  wed give them the good ol  Im sorry  the system wont allow it   Moral of the story  be nice to customer service,4817,917
832,i2db7y,1,13,Angry Customer Spills His Tools Everywhere  So just for some clarification for those who haven’t read some of my posts  I work for a store that is under a multi store ownership  Our other store sells building material  and often customers will request it to be shipped to our store for easier pick up  During the height of the lockdown that went on in my area  a contractor who we don’t like because he is arrogant and rude came in  saying he got a call some material he ordered arrived  We look through our whole receiving area  and found nothing  At this point  the customer is getting rather angry  saying he got a call from us saying it is here  We go around  asking every staff member if they saw the other store come by  and drop the material off  Everyone said they never even saw the other store arrive  So my manager tells the guy to wait in his vehicle  and he’ll make some calls to figure out what is going on  The guy is spewing  saying we don’t know how to do our jobs  and stuff like that with the usual rant  I see the guy angrily stomp back to his truck after his rant  Since it was close to us to close  I go outside to put stuff away  The whole time  I see the guy angrily stomping around his truck  slamming doors and the tailgate of his truck  After several minutes of observing his fits of rage  I see him get back into his truck  turns it on with the tailgate open  and a open toolbox resting on the back  He then hits the gas hard  and speeds out of his parking spot  going for the exit  But his tool box slid off the back  and slammed onto the ground  spilling his tools everywhere  I bit my tongue trying not to laugh as I see him stomp out of his truck  and go back to collect his fallen tools  Just as he finished and got back in  that’s was when my manager came out  and walked up to the driver side window  I see him talk to the guy for a moment  then I see the guy give a similar hand gesture like you give when you saw screw you to someone  and then he speeds out of the parking lot  So my manager comes over  chuckling  and ask him what went on  He told me his material did arrive  but it arrived at the other store  which is who phoned him  And they didn’t send it over because he never asked to have it brought over   So a few days later  I talked to a coworker from the other store  and this person dealt directly with the contractor  They told me he was nice and sweet on the phone  when he was asking about why his material wasn’t sent to our store  My coworker is not one to tolerate much  so they told him he never asked it to be sent  that they discussed if it could be sent over  but he never said yes do it  They then told me when they said they would send it over  my coworker told them “You better be nicer to the workers at the other store when you get it ” He asked “What do you mean ” My coworker replied “Because I heard how rude and disrespectful you were to them for something that wasn’t their fault  If I hear you treat them similarly like that again  we aren’t gonna bother ordering anything for you again ” He goes “Well  I’m under a lot of stress with this job  trying to get it done ” My coworker replied “That’s no excuse to treat them the way you did  So treat them better  or don’t shop with us at all ” So his material did arrive  and when he came to pick it up  let’s just say he miscommunicated how much he actually wanted  We could see his face turning red with anger during that time  but it was funny watching him trying to keep his rage under control  Hope that gave everyone a good laugh  I laughed a lot witnessing it,3610,701

835,i27vr9,1,14,yo goes from hyper and happy to destructive in  seconds flat i used to work in a little hardware store that had a cutesy pet aisle  For some stupid reason we kept the ceramic dog dishes on the bottom most shelves  Cuz you know   thats a safe place for them  One day   around noon a family comes down there to check out the aisle nearby with camping  fishing and hunting gear  This adorable  yo is running just in front of the parents and the parents are keeping a close eye on them   I was cool with it   because its not busy in that department on most days and  so far the toddler was just burning off some energy  Then you see the switch   Its instantaneous   The kid goes from happy hyper to overtired in a blink   Suddenly the  yo isnt listening to mom and dad any more   I was nearby and had a premonition immediately   The toddler suddenly is running into the dog aisle touching everything and getting mad mom and dad wont let them touch or take anything  Mom and dad start to rush toward the yo to grab them up   I think they saw what i saw   White   ceramic dog bowls sitting pretty on the bottom shelf and kid was gunning for it    I was less than  feet from the dog bowls   but toddlers are stupid fast   I reached   they reached calling the kid to stop   the toddler reaches and wins  They snatched up a dog bowl   quick as lightning glances back to incoming parents whore almost on top of the child trying to grab the bowl back  I put my arm out to try to snag it from the toddler when   I  can see it   that split decision  YEEET  Smash goes the dog bowl  The kid is already in parents arms when it lands  The mortified look on their faces  White to red in seconds   They immediately begin apologizing and offering to pay for it   Scolding their child in between   I was understanding of course   Told them Its no big deal   The dog dish shouldnt be where little hands can grab anyway  I told them to not worry about it   just make sure the little one isnt hurt  And Ill just claim it slipped from the shelf and shattered   I waved them off   they rushed red faced to check out and i cleaned the mess  I have my own toddler now in her threenage moments and i understand even more now   You can be the best parent in the world   but that wont stop a toddler from anything really,2323,468
836,i22345,1,3,The Change Man cometh Reading these posts has reminded me of something that happened to me years ago when I was a cashier at a gas station  auto parts store on a military base  We had one guy who would come in almost every day and give us a handful of change to buy gas  He drove a big old car  one of those ones that were made back when Detroit was king and got  gallons to the mile   and rarely got more than    in gas  Even though it was years ago and you paid less for gas on a military base  that still wasnt even  gallons of gas So every time he pulled in we rolled our eyes  Wed end up having to take time to count his pennies and nickels and set the prepay amount for him  holding up the line  and he always came in after work  when we were at our busiest   Other than the  month deployment he went on in the middle  this went on for more than  months  He never said anything  just came in and told us the pump number and put his change on the counter for us to count One day things were really jumping  It was pay day  it was close to a holiday  and there was a hurricane heading towards us  In the middle of a serious rush and watching anxiously for the gas truck  we were almost out of regular   we saw the big green boat that was his vehicle pull up to a pump  We sighed  knowing what was coming  But right behind him came the gas truck  Due to the age of the tanks  amp  pumps  we couldnt have anyone pumping while the gas truck delivered  and all of our regulars knew it  so they either pumped fast and left or prepared to wait  minutes or so  Change guy wasnt aware  so he came in to prepay and handed me a   bill  I was so shocked I almost dropped it  I said Id set it up  but that he would have to wait  and explained why  He responded  super quietly  almost a whisper  that that was okay  he could wait  He just needed to get on the road soon  Oh   I said   Trying to outrun the hurricane   No   he said  shaking his head   My mamas sick  Ive been sending her most of my paycheck to pay for her doctors  but its not doing much good  Ive gotta get home and take care of my sisters while shes in the hospital  I just hope this   worth of gas is enough to get me there  Yall  my heart broke  I gave him back his   and told him I would pay  he should keep it for a fill up on the way  He thanked me and went outside  we always went outside and yelled out when people could start filling  so he was going to wait for that   When I turned around the other two women at the register held out   and told me to let him fill up and we could split the change  We never saw him again after that  I hope his mom was okay TL DR  I get my comeuppance when an annoying customer turns out to be a hero,2742,548
837,i207he,1,22,Put it on ours   I work at a grocery store  and I was just getting done  I only had one item  a sweet tea   and joined the line  still in my uniform Both of my coworkers had long lines  and  everybody  had a full cart   and they are newer  so I knew itd be a bit of a wait  The lady in front of me sees I only have one item  and insists I go ahead  The lady in front of her is already unloaded  but sees my one item  and again insists I jump ahead of her  The couple in front of her are just finishing up  and spot me  and ask that I put my tea down  and theyll get it for me  I try to refuse a few times  but they tell me  honey  you earned it  you look like you had a long day  well get it for you   So they paid for my tea  Im still floating on air from these interactions  I love my customers,808,170
838,i1z1uv,1,115,Seriously  just hand me the change I just remembered this story of my time working as a cashier  It was a fairly average day  not too busy or slow   A pair came through my line  a middle aged woman  and a younger woman who Im assuming was her daughter   The two separate their items and I ring up the older woman first   It goes pretty standard until it comes time to pay   I hold out my hand for her to hand me her cash  but instead of giving me her money she drops it on the belt  activating the sensor and causing me to scramble for it before its dragged under   Luckily I managed to get it all in time but Im pretty annoyed now   So when I give the older woman her change I set it on the counter instead of handing it to her   She tuts but steps back   Her daughter steps up and I start ringing out her order   When its time to pay she hands me the money and I return the favor   This causes the older woman to tut again  and say to her daughter   oh he must really like you   Loud enough for me to hear  Later in the day my manager talks to me about a complaint I got because I  threw someones change on the counter,1129,234
839,i1ob1i,1,1,Customer goes silent after I show him our prices compared to buying prices  Many of my stories take place in my stores old location    INCLUDING THIS ONE Like many of my stories  just heard of the store  boxed up as much stuff to sell to my store  laser focused on getting cash and not store credit because doesnt care about what is on our shelves  Nothing wrong with that last one  but we cant do as much in cash So one day it was a typical slow day and we were doing inventory  Person comes in with a Playstation  and his whole collection  Well his collection included the common PS games  MGS  Ace Combat   and sports games   Literally nothing stood out  The PS he brought had a lot of wear and read disc very slowly  like from the menu to start the game  and of course discs were scratched For the life of me I cant remember what was the total value we offered him  He was dead set on getting cash though  I remember he specifically got his ace combat  and said we were going to sell it for  dollars  that one I do remember specifically  We were offering him  dollars  I went to our shelf and showed him we sold it for    He showed me many other games claiming similar and since they were all common fodder we sold all of them for less than  dollars  He eventually after showing he cant talk down to me from a position of authority just said  I am not recommending this store to anyone  and didnt say anything afterwards,1451,272
840,i19d2b,1,52,Sir  we can’t set a tent up on a BRICK PATIO So some background  I work for a rental company that setups and delivers tables chairs and tents as well as miscellaneous party stuff  Never in my  years working for the company have I came across an issue such as this   Is also like to note we are under new management because of my old boss getting fired  long story  can repost if anyone wants to hear it  On our contracts  we specifically state that our canopies go up on grass specifically because we have to put in stakes about   feet into the ground after the tent is laid out  We go to the guys house  the guy has a brick patio but we then tell him we can setup the tent because ya know  the stakes hold up the tent  he freaks out and calls my new boss blaming her when  literally he came to the shop and acknowledged the contracts terms and agreements which he signed  Tells her names I won’t say on reddit for protection sakes and me not wanting to get subreddit banned but they were not nice things to say the least  After much heated argueing  our boss calls and tells the guys who are setting up the tent to go back and grab a frame tent and water barrels  another type of tent we offer  basically the tent we setup but on top of a frame and is secured by water barrels   after they setup the frame tent  to the guys credit  he does tip them graciously among three guys    each   and they go on their way  Goes to show that sometimes the customer is not always right,1487,286
841,i0fk9y,1,81,the largest sale i’ve witnessed yet  im on mobile so i apologize if the formatting gets messed up   i work at a chain clothing retailer and our company’s major focus is caring for the customer and doing our absolute best to assist and help them  one of my managers did an incredible job of doing that today  a mother and daughter came in looking for some new clothes for the daughter who is a first year college student  she’s moving into her dorm pretty soon and wanted to get some new clothes for college  they had never shopped with us before and weren’t aware of how our sizing works or how our clothes fit so my manager helped them every step of the way  she pulled items from clearance and regular price that spanned almost every category of what we sell  tshirts  workwear  camis  kimonos  dresses  shorts  jeans  leggings  shoes  belts  and intimates  she piled everything up that they liked and put it behind the registers  when they were done  she went through every single item with them to discuss how they felt about it and confirm if they wanted it or not  it took three of us  my manager  myself  and a new employee that i was training  to ring them out  the new employee de censored and my manager scanned items before handing them to me so i could bag them  after everything was said and done  my manager made a    sale  it’s the largest single sale i’ve ever seen anyone make in my  months of working there  it might not seem like much but it’s really exciting to me to see my coworkers who i adore so much make great sales and give customers a wonderful experience  our customers expressed that my managers help made their shopping experience so much better and easier  our team let our district manager know about it and she then emailed the story to other stores in our district  it’s also nice to have a good experience like this to reflect on during these times  we all know us retail workers are stretched pretty thin right now and have more negative customer stories than we can count since returning to work  at least in America   it’s days like these that make it all worth it  i love my team and our customers,2154,391

846,hz937j,1,14,Theres A Gate For A Reason I was on a piece of lift equipment today packing out a couple of bays  which happened to be the last two bays of the aisle for me  The machine was about a foot away from the gate  and I was facing the opposite way  I hear the gate chain rattling  and next thing I know a woman comes walking in the aisle She never acknowledged me or said anything  and starts reaching right under where the machine is raised  so I looked at her and said “You know  there’s a gate there for a reason ” She  finally  just looked at me like I was an idiot so I continued and said “I can’t have you in the aisle while I’m on this which is why it’s blocked off but if you give me about  seconds I can come down and you can get what you need ”She didn’t like that  She shouts “You don’t have to be a                           about it ” and leaves the aisle  slamming the gate as hard as she could  I could hear her going off about how I was a “                         ” to whomever she was with and how rude I was  I moved forward a couple bays and came down  but she never came in the aisle so I guess she left In my three years of working with this company  and eight years working in general  no customer has ever called me that  I’m not even mad that she said that   I feel like it’s more a badge of honor than something that’s supposed to offend me honestly   I’m just appalled at how stupid people can be   even though I should know by now  Just like I told her  there’s literally a gate for a reason  so why would you go in the aisle with a machine a foot away   feet in the air  If I hadn’t heard the gate  I  easily could have backed into her since I wasn’t facing that way  or dropped something on accident  so I don’t know why she had to get so defensive about it,1792,357

861,hwnswo,1,169,Threatened a yof because his order had burnt in a warehouse fire  Hello  i thought Id share a tale from my first ever job  Im on mobile and English is my first  and only  sorry  language  The title is pretty much it tbh I used to work at a now shut homebase store in the UK  I worked up from a check out chick to staffing the customer service desk  I started at  years and quickly rose up  The day before this happened we had been informed that one of the warehouses that made and shipped new kitchens had been set on fire by accident by a group of kids messing around in it after finding a broken door that didnt lock properly  Unfortunately the fire killed  of the kids and seriously injured the rest of the kids  Starting a fire in a wood and chemical filled warehouse was a terrible idea but they were kids and didnt deserve that end and nightmares An email had gone out to people who had ordered a kitchen from us explaining that there was going to be a delay and they can wait or get a full refund and a   voucher I had been inundated with calls and people coming in asking for refunds and such in various degrees of anger but one stood out I had just swapped a screwdriver for someone who had gotten the wrong one  The old one was still on the desk when our protagonist turns up Cast Me me  C  Customer Me   hello  how can I           C   what has happened to my fucking kitchen Me   ah sir Im afraid that a fire in the warehouse has caused us to loose the entire stock of kitchens and      C   I dont fucking care what happened to your fucking warehouse  I want my kitchen Ive been waiting for weeks Me   please dont swear at me sir  C   I will do what I like  I want my kitchen  now Me   unfortunately sir due to the fire the kitchens will not be          This man just could not let me finish a sentence it seemed C   you dont listen do you  I want my kitchenMe   Sir     At this point the customer hit his limit of sanity  He grabbed the screwdriver and started waving it at me  Luckily the desk was quiet high at about chest height and big enough to have  people work in the box without too much difficulty so I was able to back away from the mad man He was shouting at me at this point but I cannot tell you what he was shouting as I was just watching the screwdriver trying to not get stabbed  What our irate customer didnt know was that this store had a security guard  Steve  who was short  muscular  permanently angry and was a good friend of mine from all the time he spent leaning on the desk pretending to work  Steve had been watching from the other end of the line of checkouts where he was stood next to the exit to the shop At seeing the guy pick up the screwdriver Steve started sprinting towards us and fully flying rugby tackled the customer around the middle and to the ground slamming his head into the concrete floor  The customer dropped the weapon and Steve dragged him out of the shop and sat on him till the police arrived  It was when the police watched the cameras that i could see the flying tackle in all its glory  Steve was very proud of that take down  I think the customer did get his refund but I dont think he got the   discount voucher that others were offered,3269,614
862,hwh3w1,1,80,Tiny thieves After reading a very recent post about a kid stealing some white chocolate kit Kats and eating them in the bathroom  it reminded me of the one time kids tried to steal from my job but got caught  Years later  this story is still very strong in my memory and thought it would be time to write it out  Dont remember many of the words used  but I do remember the sequence things went in and what the conversations entailed About   years ago one evening  it was somewhat close to closing time  I was doing the closing duties which involved alot of cleaning  and just so happened to be cleaning the bathrooms at the time  Normally I keep the cleaning cart outside the door  blocking it  because its a little too big to bring in  So every now and then I would need to open the door to the hallway to get a different cleaner Two little girls  sisters  stood in the hallway  A younger Id say about  or   and the older maybe  or   were waiting by my cart  I politely told them  and apologized  that the bathrooms were currently closed but should be open again in a few minutes  I had just sprayed cleaner on everything  They scurried away and I went back inside and quickly finished When I came out  they at first werent there  It wasnt until I pushed the cart over to the mens restroom and cleaned a little in there before coming out to swap cleaners  that i caught the back of the older sister running into the bathroom  Few minutes pass again  finish with the mens restroom  and push the cart to the back to tidy up and throw out the trash bags My manager had come in and asked me if I had cleaned the restrooms yet  and when I replied yes  she made the follow me hand motion and we went towards the front of the store  On the way up  she faced me and was walking backwards as she explained quietly that she found boxes of empty toys in one of the tiny trashcan located within the stall  and asked if I had changed them out  I told her I did but did see the two little girls go in and described what they looked like Upon getting to the front of the store  I was told to monitor the little girls through the mirror on the back wall  who were still in the toy isle   while the manager told the cashier up front about the situation and to notify her when their guardian came up  Didnt have to wait long because only a few seconds later their grandmother came up with some medication followed by the two little girls  who were empty handed Once she was checking out  my manager came up and asked if the grandmother would like to add the toys to the transaction  Of course the grandmother had no idea what she was talking about  so the manager removed box after box from the bag and placed them on the counter  The two little girls were trying so hard to act like theyve never seen those before  So grandma stared at the boxes  looked at the kids  and started yelling  They both start tearing up and remove the toys from their pockets  Whatever is in those little blind box num noms  I assume chapstick at the time  Just kept unloading them onto the counter The grandmother was so mad  yelling that this wasnt how their family has raised them  said she would be back to purchase  and stormed out with the kids  She then came back in after minute  paid for everything including the toys  but said we could keep them in the store because she was not going to be rewarding their behavior  Profusely apologized and left  I was talking with the cashier  telling her about everything leading up to this  all she was told was to look out for the family with two little girls because of a theft   Next thing we know  we hear crying  And its getting louder The grandmother walks in practically dragging the younger one who is just nothing but tears and a red face  They come back up    with a num noms toy   and its not broken into  She pays for the toy  hands it to the little girl  and leaves with the child all without a word When I asked my manager later that night how exactly she found the empty packages  she said that she noticed the little girls run out from the bathrooms hallway and had a small feeling to go check  Noticed I wasnt in the hallway anymore  and went into the bathroom  The stall trashcan was not only stuffed with them  but overflowing too  We are talking maybe   boxes  and theyre pretty decently sized,4369,806
863,hw2w4x,1,3,You cant write something thats printed I usually travel working at renaissance festivals rn im home because of the current apocalypse lol  but this happened in Tampa in   I sell handmaid clothes and we have some expensive stuff on of which being corsets  the corsets start at   and go up from there  We had a lady and her boyfriend walk into our booth wanting to do an exchange on a black cotton   corset that was from us and it was all least  maybe  sizes too small for her and had mud splattered on it  She said she had bought it the week before and that my co worker Ill call RC had sized her for it and she didnt wear it out and havent worn it because she cant fit into it  Manager at the desk  Ill call her Lizzie  informed her we couldnt exchange it because its covered in mud the girl doesnt press the mater but her boyfriend sure did    He started yelling telling us we had to refund there monie  Lizzy said   we dont do refunds and we dont do exchanges on worn clothing   He didnt like that and said  it doesnt say that on the reseat  Lizzy pointed at the to of the reseat where its printed on there and circled meaning that it was explained during the purchase  He said   you wrote that on there today     Lizzy showed where its printed on all of our reseat in all of our reseat books  I think I went on break at this point but they just argued back and forth for a while until she told him to go home and call the owner of the company to see if she could do anything for him  Afterword we all decided she probably never purchased the corset in the first place it was way too small for her nobody could get her in it unless she gained  pounds in the last week  She either got it from somebody else closet of found it on the ground while walking out last week  Anyway  thats a short version of the story I cut out a few things like me trying to get her in the corset and us asking RC if he remembered her from the week prior but yeah just another fun day arguing with a random customer,2025,395

865,hvfd3b,1,166,The Bathrooms Have To Be Along The Back Wall   Happened earlier today  still pretty miffed about it I work in the back room receiving area of a large store whos building is older than I am  Anyway  there is a gate that normally goes across this back area blocking it off from the rest of the store with a sign on it saying   Employees Only Beyond This Point   This is a nice thing to have as it allows me to do my work without being bothered by customers with questions  since I dont know much about our stock other than how much of it we have or when the next shipment is due  But unfortunately  most of my fellow employees dont understand it  and constantly leave it open when they come through  usually to just throw away trash  I am pretty tired of having to shut it at least  times an hour and sometimes just let it stay open Today  an older gentleman comes into the back while I am working  and just stands there  huffing to himself  Normally  I try to help out lost customers the best I can  but this guy just marched himself back there  into an area that is clearly different from the rest of the store and stood there  wrists on his hips and a pissed look in his eyes  so I pretend like I didnt see him and got back to work Just my luck  he doesnt take the cue and walks right up to me and huffs in the most perturbed voice I have heard from a customer thus far   Hey  where are your bathrooms   I  already having a bad day as we are slammed with freight and the night crew left half of their work laying about in my area  look at him and answer   Other side of the store  sir   I just came from there   he huffs louder at me   and they are most certainly arent there  Me  still not caring enough to deal with him   I am sorry  sir  but I know they are  They are between Electronics and the outside retail doors    crosses arms and narrows his eyes at me    I didnt see them  I went up and down the back wall and its not there  I sigh as I realize whats going on  I have to answer this same question daily   The bathrooms arent along the back wall  its on the side wall  But still on the other side of the store  He then goes into a mini tirade about how there should have been a sign  there are  and they are bigger than me  and how all bathrooms should be along the back wall Me  now getting pissed   Sir  its not on the back wall and cant be on the back wall   Why not   Because neither I  nor you  where here when the building plans were being drawn up  Now  if you want the restrooms  they are on the other side of the building  He starts huffing and trying to say something further but I cut him off   Sir  if you want I can show you to the bathroom   He scowls at me  but agrees  I walk him towards the rest of the store and point above the racking at the ceiling on the other end of the building   Can you see the bathroom sign  sir   Yes  finally   he huffs once more  Good   I say as he gets to the other side of where the gate goes  and I slam it close   You can handle the rest from here   I cant say what his face was like after that as I turned on my heels and returned to work  but I do know he stood there for a hot second before stomping off towards the bathrooms,3235,615
866,hv7t2e,1,8,The confused shoplifter Saw a post about a dumb shoplifter and it inspired me to tell this story While I was working on my degree  I worked at a gas station to make ends meet  This gas station was in a pretty low income part of town  Not dangerous  just full of    interesting people I should add that I hated my job  They were greedy  and didnt care about their employees at all  we were expendable  For example  I got robbed while working there and was assaulted in the process  Had a black eye and everything  I found out upper management specifically asked the police to investigate me for involvement  After having been there nearly a decade  in both management and regular positions  and never having had my till come up short  Really proved to me that I was just a warm body to them Anyways  I was working late shift one night  It was about a m  when this girl  probably late teens early s came in  She was obviously drunk  She was also the only person in the store  I saw her walk to the beer cooler and grab a couple of Mikes hard lemonades and then meander around the rest of the store  Lo and behold  she comes to the counter with a stick of gum and nothing else  Best part is  she didnt even hide the beer well  I could see it in the inside of her jacket  which was open  Me   Should I ring up the beer  too  Her   what beer  Me   those   pointing at the cans in her jacket She looks sheepish and takes them out of her pocket and sets them on the counter  apologizing Im thoroughly entertained at this point and chuckling  I tell her it was a good try  ring up her gum  and tell her the total  She obviously thought she was going to be in trouble so she looked really bewildered  I wasnt about to get this girl in legal trouble over a hilariously bad attempt at shoplifting  though  Hell  if it wasnt alcohol  I probably wouldnt have even stopped her  F    their profit margins Anyways  still looking confused af  she was like   so    am I in trouble  Me   I mean  youre not getting the beer  and you shouldnt steal  Her   So can I still come to the store  Or are you going to ban me  Me   Nah  just dont try to steal next time   Her   uh    okay  Sorry  again  She paid her    for her gum and left  still looking thoroughly confused  I spent the rest of the night laughing to myself over the whole interaction No big climax or crazy people  just a drunk girl being dumb and getting caught  It just still makes me laugh to this day  so I thought Id share  I have a lot more crazy  and more eventful  stories from my time in fast food and convenience stores that Ill share sometime  Just was reminded of this one today,2677,483

870,htqaak,1,386,I TOLD YOU that you DO sell them here   I used to work at a medium department store popular for its overpriced furniture  imported foreign food and candy  and wine selection  Our stores tend to attract a lot of   The customer is always right   types because most items are just on the cusp of  high end  retail  A customer walks in and wanders around the snack section for awhile before flagging me down  Customer   Yes  Im looking for these chocolate Italian bears    Me   Im sorry  Ive never heard of anything like that here    I should point out that Ive worked at this particular location for five years and was the head of the gourmet department so I did all the inventory and stocking by myself  I also have a huge sweet tooth so if something new comes in  I dont miss it    Customer   No  no  I bought it here last Christmas  I know you carry them  Theyre little chocolate bears in CLEAR cellophane wrapping   I ask her if she can remember any part of the name and shes stumped  but insists theyre here Im thinking it must be a Christmas exclusive item so I go to our Italian aisle in Christmas and start looking around and then back to our regular chocolate aisle  I suggest a few similar Italian chocolates  maybe she just meant there was a bear on the package because Baci does have a polar bear on some of their boxes and thats Italian   After thirty minutes  I give up and try to search keywords into our AS system  For those of you who were blessed to never deal with this system  its an archaic application used for inventory but you have to spell things EXACTLY in order or the system either spits out  retired SKUs or nothing at all  The customer is starting to get irate that Im trying to find the item in the computer and I can tell my actions of trying to go above and beyond are just annoying her because it doesnt look like Im physically doing anything  so I finally just tell her that it doesnt look like that particular item is in stock anymore She leaves back to the chocolate section and not even five minutes later  comes stomping back to the register waving a white and red box in the air  I FOUND IT  I TOLD YOU that you DO carry it   she says in this sing song smug as fuck voice I look at the box and reply   Maam  those arent chocolate bears  Theyre Happy Hippos  And theyre German   As much as Id love to tell you that she saw the error of her ways and apologized  she instead says   Well  you should have known what I meant  Edit  For people complaining that Kinder is Italian  in America  all imported items come with a fat paper label to give you the nutritional information in English  On any Kinder product  it says Product of Germany  In my store  items also have special labels on the shelf to say where it originates from  which ours says Germany and it is always grouped with the German candies  Kinder was also created in Frankfurt  Germany the year before it was introduced to Italy  Americans consider this a German product  so if you said Italian  youre not going to get what youre looking for unless youre specifically like   The ferrero brand   and even then  its going to take the cashier a moment to figure it out  Theres no giant logo aside from Kinder on the boxes   So yeah  made by an Italian company  but imported and made in Germany  Considered German here,3368,602

873,htacx1,1,25,Customer wants refund for   reward she got for free  This just happened an hour or so ago but it was so frustrating dealing with this fucking Karen So I work at a home goods store in the returns department  It’s my last customer of the night so of course she had to be difficult  Customer wants to return some items she paid for  okay no problem But then she shows me the receipt and I see that she used multiple   rewards that were given to her from her ‘Store Brand’ credit card  Problem is  these   rewards are a one time use and deducts a certain amount of cents from each item on the receipt so it’s not just one line item you can return  So if she bought something that was    the   reward only took off    or    depending on how many items she bought I try to explain this to her and say that the    reward is a one time use but she wasn’t buying it  It was so hard to explain to her that she wasn’t getting the reward money back and I could only refund what she spent by credit card  I ended up calling two managers over who debated with her back and forth for TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES  She got the reward for free  but she was acting like we were stealing from her  She kept saying she might as well burn up the reward paper she had with her  No matter what way we tried to explain it ‘you only get back what you paid for with your credit card’ ‘you didn’t pay for the   it was given to you as a reward’ ‘rewards are void after use’ she just WOULD NOT GET IT Eventually I got her to complete the return but she also tried to return some clearance items that we rejected straight away cause they were final sale  But JFC this lady just got on my motherfucking nerves,1703,331

875,ht98s6,1,9,A not so normal return I am putting my two weeks notice in tomorrow as I head off to college  This was my first retail job  and let me say  retail is a whole new breed of work  When I first entered the store  I was a timid sales clerk that stumbled through my sentences  Now  I am funny and love to interact with customers of all types   I look back at this one customer  and you know what  I realize that some people are a whole different type of shopper  To the story  I work at a retailer that supplies a lot of home appliances and furniture  We have some of the best customers I have ever worked with  and we pride ourselves on being customer friendly  I have only had a handful of customers that get on my nerves  but most of my customers are lovely people  We opened before a lot of other stores in our area  and we had a lot of people coming in and out  We were also one of the few stores accepting returns  Us associates have very strict instructions to follow with returns  and some customers get confused  amp  agitated with those instructions  Eventually  they get their money back  and we are able to quarantine those items  Most times  It was a sunny afternoon when I was working on the return desk  we had a specific register for returns at this time   The queue was rather thin  and the story was empty  I was one of two cashiers up there at the moment  and the other cashier was fetching a price check for something  The queue is set up where you have to go around a certain section to get to the front  The end of the queue is near the front of the store  so people typically realize they enter the wrong side of the queue and follow the directions on the floor  But  no  not this person Lets call him Richard  for obvious reasons  I am getting ready to help the next people in the queue when Richard storms in with two bags in his hands  He is agitated  a blind man could see it  He cuts through the queue  the wrong way  and slams his receipt on the table  Return these for me   His tone immediately sets me off  I couldnt tell if he didnt see the people standing right there  or if he innocently went the wrong way  Sir  there is the queue  you came in the      No  I didnt  Return them  now   I was taken aback by his tone  I would have thought he was joking  honest to god  But  no  This guy was furious  for no reason  Folks I will be right with you  okay   The two people in the queue nod and I get to work on the return  He proceeds to put the bag on the desk and a piece of torn off cardboard falls in my hands  The front of the tag is cut off  keep that in mind  I look at the first item and notice it is a set of bath mats  I look at the receipt on my screen  and it shows that there were two bathmats purchased  I look at the tag  as it is the one that goes to the mats  It clearly states that it is    The other purchased mats  that he didnt bring  are     Alright  sir  So this one will be refunded    If you could put your card in  it will go right back on there   Give that to me   he snaps as he takes my receipt  He then points at the    That is    I dont know what you are talking about  This is ridiculous   I give a small prayer up above before nodding and marking that return at    I wasnt going to fight him  As I am almost finished with that return  I notice he has a bag in his hand containing a small rug  Do you sell this here   I nod at him before he throws it on my counter  I look at the receipt and to the rug before realizing there is no way that this rug was on the receipt   Sir  I am afraid this rug is not on this receipt  There is not a tag on it either  However  if you give me a moment I can get you a price  I will need to see your drivers license   This is ridiculous  put it back on my damn card already  I dont have my license  why do you even need that   I take in a silent breath before excusing myself to get a price  I come back and notice him tapping his fingers on my desk  he is looking at his phone while muttering something under his breath  It is   sir  I need your drivers license through or I cant give you the return   I told you before  I dont have it   Then we cant take it   He snatches the rug away  but he leaves the bag on my desk  I say a small prayer before finishing the transaction  or so I thought  Sir  I am afraid we are unable to take the bag  It is for our safety        Why  Its your damn bag  Youre acting absolutely ridiculous at this point   I feel like the only work he knows is ridiculous  I start to get teary eyed as he continues to rant at me  The people in the queue feel bad  but no one bothers to say anything  Just return the damn r     I am going to get my manager   I am starting to cry at this point as I cant handle being yelled at  You dont have to cry just      I didnt hear him as I walked over to one of my managers and tell her that she can go deal with Richard  I am sobbing and take a moment in the break room  I never had a customer that angry before  After ten minutes  I composed myself and ignored my tear stained cheeks and bloodshot eyes  My manager asked me if I was alright  and I managed to choke out a yes  The rest of the customers that saw it apologized and asked if I was okay  I was My manager ended up giving me a small thing of candy as she felt bad  I never thought I would have to deal with that  and I pray he doesnt come back

876,ht3tlm,1,66,Sir  those break pads were installed upside down    This was probably  years ago at this point  but I worked at an auto parts store right out of technical college   We sold brake pads with a lifetime warranty   The warranty covers manufacturing issues as well as  long term wear  you wear those brake pads down from normal use   You can then buy new ones and bring back the old ones for the warranty  or  bring us the old ones and we can swap them out right there    What is  NOT covered is improper use  installing on something other than the  vehicle s  the pads were intended   modifications to the pads  or  as in  this case  improper installation  Cast   Mekanik   the  mechanic  guy who purchased and apparently installed the pads  Me   yours truly   Boss   my boss  duh   CW   my coworker who was a master mechanic at a car company with a blue  logo before a motorcycle accident prevented him from actually working on cars anymore   I say that all because hes the guy who would know what hes talking about    He was also in the back of the store and didnt hear any of the interaction Mekanik guy comes in with the brake pads he purchased a short time ago   They are not at all usable anymore   He bought our top of the line ceramic brake pads   These pads were a fairly new product in our store at the time  and we didnt know how they actually performed   But they  were marketed as the best ceramic pads you could buy for every day  driving as well as a little high speed fun on the weekends   So to have  them go bad in a short amount of time was odd to be sure Mekanik    These pads are garbage   I bought them a few months ago and theyre already trashed   AND they ruined my rotors   So you guys need to give me new pads and pay for new rotors too  I explain that were sorry about the issue and wed be glad to help  in any way we can and blah blah blah     I take a look a the pads and  immediately notice the odd wear pattern  It looks like the pads were  installed upside down Me    Umm    Sir  these pads look like they were installed upside down    Mekanik    UPSIDE DOWN   No   I am a mechanic   I have been working on cars for loner than youve been alive     this goes on for a hot  minute but the conversation followed those lines   how dare you  who do  you think you are  threatens my job blah blah blah      Boss man hears  the commotion and steps in to try to calm things down Boss man    Hi sir  what seems to be the issue here  Mekanik    This punk seems to think he knows better than me and claimed I installed my brake pads upside down  Boss Man    Sir  the wear pattern on these pads show that they were installed upside down   With that being the case  unfortunately we cannot warranty the pads out   The warranty does not cover improper  installation  Mekanik    What kind of a store is this   Is this how you treat all of your customers      Blah blah blah    you know the drill Boss Man    Sir  if it would make you feel better  we do have an employee who was a master mechanic for   car company   and keeps his ASE   Automotive Service Excellence  certifications current   Would you like  him to take a look  Mekanik    Absolutely   Get someone up here with a brain      Boss Man    Hey  CW  Can you come up here for a second  CW    Yeah boss     walks up to the counter   Whats up  Boss Man    CW  do you notice anything odd about these brake pads  CW    Yeah  looks like they were installed upside down  Mekanik guy is fuming at this point   He finally leaves with no new  pads  and no new rotors   My coworkers and I had a pretty good laugh  about that as well as a conversation about how the hell he installed the  pads upside down   Some context   I did look like a punk   I was   years old  long shaggy hair  and was fresh out of mechanic school   I was in no way assuming I knew everything about cars   I just noticed the wear pattern and the notches worn out that indicated that the pads were installed upside down ASE certifications are needed to get a job at any reputable mechanic shop   Getting one is tough  and getting multiple takes specialized  training and studying   Master mechanic certifications are even tougher to get because you need specialized training from a specific company   car manufacturer  semi manufacturer  agricultural machines manufacturer  motorcycles manufacturer  etc       So CW absolutely knew what he was talking about  Anyone who has done a break job before  its really not that hard if you have the right tools and a little know how  knows its pretty difficult to put new pads on an old caliper the  right  way   The pads and caliper are literally curved with the curvature of the brake rotor  How this guy got them on upside down is beyond me,4783,914
877,ht188j,1,31,How should local retailer boycott credit card processing fees  CC processing fee has eaten a large part of profit  Its usually     of the total transaction amount  We are in a small town  only  grocery stores here  One store recently become cash only except EBT  but their customer base are mostly Hispanics who are used to carrying cash  while ours are mostly English speaking Americans who dont usually carry more than   of cash Debit PIN transaction is secure  fast and has a much lower fee of     so we would prefer being paid in debit PIN transaction than credit  How should we boycott CC processing fee  On the business side and legal side  what can we do  Retail companies cannot legally organize all  to stop accepting CC because that will be a  cartel  with antitrust violations   Can the retail workers union boycott CC  if the stores promise   of the saved CC processing fees will give them a salary boost,942,163

879,hshiy4,1,0,Customer complains about paper bag being placed on floor to be unhygienic for her clothes I am a till operative in the UK at a clothes goods store  Since lockdown has been lifted to an extent  our store has reopened with the typical health measures  glass panel per till  more space etc   This was my first shift back and probably  customers in  Every customer I have served I have placed the paper bag their items go in on the floor beside me for security purposes  also there isnt so much space on the counter now due to the panel   Ive been doing this method even before lockdown and we have all been told to do this anyway  Anyway my customer and her friends approach my counter and I start bagging their items up  bag on the floor facing upright  and her face drops and gets nasty and she bluntly says to me  Are you putting my clothes on the floor    I got annoyed and lifted the bag up  with her clothes inside  and said  No   And then she snaps at me and goes  youve been putting my clothes in a bag on the floor and now I want you to put them in a new bag and put this new bag on the counter right now   She then rambled on and said  what you just did is very unhygenic I cant believe you did that  First of all it doesnt make much difference where I put this bag  if I put the bag on the counter then technically its still unhygienic because people put their hands through the glass panel to give me money or to grab their bags  think of the lack of hygiene there      Secondly the only part of the bag that is unhygienic is the bottom and its hardly likely shell keep the bag once she goes home so whats the big deal  Also her clothes wouldnt have been affected Thirdly if hygiene is a big deal to her then maybe she shouldnt be out shopping in a busy store filled with people and limited social distancing Has anybody experienced strange things like this going back to work from lockdown,1927,359
880,hsdbxe,1,113,Maam  the store is on fire  I was working at a large chain store   This all conspired towards  the end of my shift  go figure    I was just taking some trash back to  the dumpster when a customer stopped me to inquire about a smoky smell   I  call my manager on a radio Me   Hey    boss    Ive got a customer telling me they smell smo    Fire alarm blares  That answered that   We  escort guests out of the store and make sure all staff is out  with  section leaders making sure all of their staff is out   What happened  next is    just plain stupid   Some Karen was flabbergasted that the  manager of the registers wouldnt go in and ring out her groceries Karen   Hi I have a cart full of groceries   Can I just check them out really fast  Manager   Maam  the store is on fire   Its against company policy  not to mention illegal  for me to return to the store   K   Ill give you my card and everything   Its not that much stuff    but its a cart full of groceries  M     I am not going in there to ring out some groceries   The building is  on fire   At best  I can have the fire department retrieve any personal  items  K   But I need those groceries  M   There is a   different store   the next block over   Im sure they have the groceries you need  K   But I already did my shopping here   There are frozen items  M   Im sorry  but I am not going in the store while    its on fire     This  went on much longer than it should have before Karen eventually huffed  off   My manager explained multiple times that THE STORE WAS ON FIRE   but she just couldnt grasp the concept of how dangerous and stupid it  was to demand we risk our lives for her groceries Mind  you  there was no mistaking that the store was definitely closed for  the evening because of the fire   Fire trucks were all around  cops   ambulances  ect     But there were still people driving by asking if we  were open For those wondering   our trash compactor caught fire   Turned out some teens thought that  lighting garbage on fire was funny   They were caught  arrested  and  charged with a felony   Fortunately  the fire was contained to the trash  compactor  no product was lost  the building was not damaged save for  the smell of smoke the next few days while it aired out  and most  importantly no one was injured,2337,444
881,hsar60,1,21,JUST READ Ironic TLDR  Lady doesnt want to read the sign  nor pay for her sh  tI dont know about you guys  but I cant stand these customers   the ones who stare at a sign  seemingly have some kind of brain cell between their ears and then turn to ask exactly what the sign answers Did you not just read it   This story takes place a few months ago  prior to this whole rona  during a popular holiday in my area  This holiday is very similar to Halloween with one exception  the customers love to print labels  I honestly dont know what they do with these labels  but they really   really   need them right that second and no one orders them in advance or actually has any clue what theyre doing  Which means a lot of repetitive explaining  pointing at signs  and frustrated and angry customers The thing is  my printing center doesnt actually have any label paper for them to print on other than this very simple return address label which you have to order through our website  Thats it  Theres no magic system in our computers that can magically set up these labels to print perfectly on whatever sheet our customers find lying around their house  So if you want us to set up your design for you  thats a fee  Also it takes like  hours  which they never have since they need it RIGHT NOW Also we only have two giant  industrial ready  LASER printers  If a customer brings in paper thats meant to go into an inkjet printer  a more high quality photo like printer  it will absolutely get demolished in that machine  It will and has broken our fuser in the machine  a   part   So no  I wont just  try it  when they demand that its worked before in the past  You could be lying  and I wont stake   on it and be stuck with a broken machine until new parts come in For all of these reasons  we had to post signs  MULTIPLE SIGNS  which basically read  gt   For any   Holiday   Label printing      gt    gt      If we set up your file  you will be charged a minimum    design fee  plus the price of printing  Here is how to set up your file with labels bought from  the retail part of the store     insert instructions       gt    gt      You paper MUST say  Laser safe   We will deny any order that is placed with label papers that does not have the original packaging      gt    gt      Turn times depend on how busy we are  You can pay an extra   to get your order faster  however the P amp M Associate will determine when that is based upon current order queue   Regardless of the sign  the customers still ask the same questions  So a woman comes in with a USB in her hand  After waiting in a lengthy line which Im doing my best to serve as fast as possible  shes a bit huffy when it gets to her turn Now Ive already told the customers ahead of her to look at the sign regarding our labels before placing their own order  So  hopefully  when she comes up she will do the same Nope Label Lady LL  Me ME LL   Jabs USB towards me  cuz f  ck me I guess   I have a picture on here I would like on x sticker paper ME    Okay  is your picture already set up to go on x label paper   lol I wont grab the USB stick until I know for sure shes going to place this order  I know from experience if I touch the damned thing  its assumed Ive accepted the job and wont charge for anything  LL   I want sticker paper  and no   you set it up for me  ME   while Im saying this  I also gesture to our sign thats printed in a large format and mounted right in front of her face    Label paper is what we print on  and we charge an additional    fee for any set up we need to do  Also  we do not have x label paper behind the counter  but you can—  LL         Thats absurd  You guys did it for me last time and set it up and everything  This is outrageous  Where does it say that   ME   literally points to it on the sign   You mean last   holiday    that was a year ago and the policies have changed recently  However  you can just go to this website here and—  LL   I never had to do anything like that  This is ridiculous  ME   Regardless  this is the policy now and I have no problem walking you through the steps on how to do it  You would just need to buy the paper from aisle— LL   and now Ive got to buy the paper too    she puts her hands on her hips and glares at me ME   Youve always had to buy the label paper    At this point Im just angry and probably not doing a good job at hiding it  ME   I interrupt her since I can tell shes just going to argue again with me   This sign will tell you how you need to set up your files  We are a print ready shop  as in you come in with your prints ready to go  If they are not already set up  we charge a fee for that  LL   I want a manager or someone who knows what theyre doing  They didnt charge me for this last year  I dont deserve to pay this  So I call a manager over and they dont know anything about the printing department so my manager turns to me and asks MANAGER   So  whats the policy this year  ME    states exactly what I told her  MANAGER   Okay    repeats exactly what I said to the customer   LL   furiously tries to stammer out that its ridiculous yadda yadda MANAGER   Okay  so know our policy  would you still like to place this order or not  LL   turns around and walks away,5363,984
882,hs75zd,1,216,Customers get trapped in the store because the closing announcements didn’t apply to them  I guess  I’m a cashier at a shop in the UK that sells clothing and home goods  For some reason we’ve had a bit of an uptick in    interesting     customers ever since we reopened post lockdown so if you guys want more stories I have a couple more to share  but this one is probably my favourite so far I tend to cover a lot of closing shifts  and a lot of the time I get to do the announcements to let customers know the store is closing  At       and   I say  roughly  “This is a customer announcement  The time in  shop  is  X  and we are closing in  Y  minutes  Can all remaining customers please make their way to the checkouts so that we can finalise your purchases before we close  Thank you ” and at  the announcement goes “The time in  shop  is  o’clock and we are now closed  Can any remaining customers please make their way to the checkout so we can finalise your purchases ” Basically  if you’re in the shop after   it’s pretty hard to miss the fact that we are in the process of closing up On the day this incident occured all the shopfloor colleagues got to leave right on the dot of  because they’d finished all their tasks for the night  so after we closed there were only three of us in the shop  me  my supervisor on checkouts  S   and my colleague  M  who was acting as the manager on shift  After I did the last closing announcement we waited a couple of minutes in case any more customers appeared  finished cashing up the tills  and then M locked the shop and went to the cash office while S and I went to the warehouse to do some jobs there  By this point we had been closed for about   minutes S and I have been in the warehouse for a couple of minutes sorting out returns when  suddenly  the warehouse door  which doesn’t lock so people can get in and out easily with heavy cages  flies open  And a customer  accompanied by her   year old son  pokes her head in I’m like “Um    hello ” because frankly my brain is refusing to process this situation a little bit  and the customer  honestly less stressed than I would be in this situation  goes “Can somebody let us out please  ”I call over to S  who’s further back in the warehouse  and she asks me to call M  who has the keys and can let them out  The only phone that the cashiers have access to is at the checkouts on the other side of the shop  and I don’t really want the customers to wander off again  so I go “Okay  if you just follow me over to the checkouts I’m going to call my manager on shift so that she can let you out ”And this customer’s face LIGHTS UP  And she goes “Oh  Are the tills still open ”Please bear in mind  it is  minutes after closing  This woman is actively trapped in the store  The shutters are down  There has been nobody on the shop floor  let alone at the checkouts  for several minutes  She had to go into an employees only area to get help  And now she thinks the checkouts are open and she can buy something At this point I feel no obligation to be polite and I’m honestly also just baffled so I go “No   There were actually several announcements letting you know the store was closing ”“Oh  I know ” she says  and at this point I feel such a boiling rage overtake me that all I can do without getting myself in trouble is shut up and walk over to the phone The story wraps up pretty quickly after that  I call M  whose verbatim response to “Hi  there’s some customers stuck in the store” is “Oh  for fuck’s sake ” M lets them out  but not without also locking herself out of the cash office because she didn’t bring those keys out with her in the rush to let these customers out  And I lie awake at night wondering how on earth I can make “We are closed  Either come and pay NOW or get out of the store” into a polite and professional closing announcement for future use,3916,735

890,hr98ss,1,23,Tales of disgruntled customers I work as a cartpusher for a retail establishment  one of many upsides of being a cart pusher is you don’t have to deal with disgruntled customers as much as people on the sales floor but not on this day  I’m pushing up a line of carts to the grocery side when I get to the garage door for the grocery entrance  I hear what sounded like incoherent screaming I turn around to see a man parked by the grocery pickup area    early s   mid s  pacing back and forth in front of a white Honda Civic   not sure year or model looked like a newer model  Him “yeah you   ” Me  visible confusion  Him “because of your dumbass one of the carts you left over there  the wind caught it and blew it and it hit my car  ” Me  visible confusion  as he’s standing bare minimum  feet away from me with no carts near his car  “right well   unfortunately sir there’s nothing I can do for you regarding this would you like to talk to a manager ”Him “no I don’t want to talk to a manager  Look at what you did to my car you f cking dumbass ” Me  gets radio out  “I need assistance out here I got a man accusing me of damaging his car  He is screaming at me  cussing at me  He’s very dissatisfied ” Less than a minute later the asset protection manager  support manager  and assistant manager come out  I quickly met them right outside of the garage door and quickly tell them that I have no idea what happened he just started loosing his mind accusing me of damaging his car  We all walk over to his vehicle and  the man has his finger pointed at an incredibly small dent in the front left side of his vehicle  If he didn’t have his finger there screaming “LOOK AT WHAT HE DID TO MY VEHICLE   ” I wouldn’t have even seen it  The guy starts going off yelling at the managers how I’m a dumbass and  this is all my fault that the wind supposedly blew a basket over  feet to hit his car  On a smooth flat surface with no hill incline and  no strong winds that day Him “Do you have any idea how hard I work to keep a spotless vehicle and his dumbass f cks everything up  ” At this point I couldn’t hold it back started letting some laughs out because  I didn’t lay a finger on this mans vehicle and I don’t control the wind  Assistant manager “stop laughing” I left to go to a cart carol to get more baskets because   I was thinking if I kept laughing this guy could attack me or something  I get back up about maybe a minuet or  later with more carts parked them right by the door and walked back over and the guy is still loosing his mind screaming at the managers  At this point the guys wife comes out of the store doesn’t even question what’s going on just walks right by it and sits in the passenger seat of the vehicle Him “Are you even going to pay for this  Look at my car ” Assistant manager “sir  if our associate did not damage your vehicle but  rather the wind picked up a basket as you told us then this is an act of nature we are not responsible for acts of nature ” Him “So the store even won’t pay for this  ” Assistant manager “sir you can file an incident report with us and we can do an investigation but there’s no guarantee that we will be held accountable for the damages ” Him “FORGET IT   ” Guy sits down in his vehicle and I turn to the managers  Me “I have no idea honestly where this guy is coming from I didn’t see a single basket near the c   ” Turn around to see him sitting in the drivers seat  one hand on the steering wheel the other hand flipping me off while repeatedly screaming “F ck you    ” Me  gives the guy the biggest smile I can while waving at him goodbye as he’s backing up  In the end I didn’t get in trouble for any of this and  there was no investigation launched regarding this issue,3793,719

894,hqt8sn,1,0,Playing it unsafe When I worked for a thrift store  I had this interesting  yet frustrating story   As a thrift store  we got all kinds of random stuff  including sporting equipment   We would occasionally get rollerblades from time to time among the sporting goods   This is important I was doing my thing by putting away newly arrived merch and go backs when I saw a kid that looked no older than  or  messing around the store   I didnt think much of it as people would bring their kids while thrifting   A moment later  I saw the same kid crawling around the store with his hands in a pair of rollerblades  gliding down the aisles and I have no idea where his parent or guardian is   I tell him politely that he cant do that because its not safe   He smiles me and ceases doing this activity for what seemed like five minutes  And then hes at it again I ask him kindly  again  to stop scooting on the floor with the rollerblades and he smiles at me and ceases doing it momentarily and then starts it up again   I tell him AGAIN to stop doing this  He stops and starts again  rinse and repeat   I am sick of this and quite concerned that he could seriously hurt himself so I pull my supervisor aside and tell her that I have been watching this little imp scoot around the store with rollerblades on his hands for the past   minutes and ignoring me  She nods in acknowledgement and leaves to do something else   At this point  I didnt know if he was trying to be defiant and do what he wants  my logic was that he ignored me because I wasnt his parent or guardian  About  minutes or so passes and I go to ring a Hispanic woman at the register and I ask her if she had any discounts for seniors  military  etc   She looks at me funny and tells me something along the lines of  no English    Standing with her was her son and it turns out that he was the Wild Child that was scooting around the store with rollerblades   Turns out that the kid ignored me because he didnt understand English  From what I observed  this woman did NOTHING to corral her kid or tell him to knock it off  She was off hanging out with her friends and perusing through clothing   Parents need to parent,2202,422

896,hqp0q4,1,10,You Have Fun With That  This incident happened a couple years ago so Im going off what I can remember There was this kid  no more than  years old  who would come in occasionally during the night and graveyard shifts  More times than not the kid was high out of his mind and would just say the dumbest things that made no sense  He also tried to act like he was tough s    t all the time but to me he was just an idiot  Some backstory  The city my store is located at is notorious for its crime  Weve been ranked in magazines as the worst city to live in in America  So I am fairly used to encountering people on drugs  theft  and violent people at this store  One night I was working in our stores photo department  entering in something on the computer  when the kid comes up to my counter  Ive already had it with this kid on past occasions  so I was less than polite with him as the following conversation ensued  Kid  You gonna give me a hug Me  Nope Kid  Aww why not Me  I dont know you like that and youre not worth it Kid  Thats cold By this point I was done with the conversation and went back to the computer  This blocked my view of the kid to where I could only see his shoulders and head  He said something else to me  but I wasnt paying attention to him anymore Me  Well you have fun with that Kid  What Me  I said  you have fun with that Kid  Damn  you tough He then lifts up his shirt  but since I was behind the computer I could only see the hem of his shirt was by his shoulders  I just thought he was being weird from the drugs again  He then walks away  My coworker  lets call him Steve  walks up to me a few minutes later Steve  Hey  did you see that guy Me  Yeah  proceeds to tell him about my encounter with the kid Steve  Dude  he had a gun Me  WHAT Steve  Yeah  he was telling me that he was high on thizz and he showed me his gun under his shirt Me  Why didnt you call the police  Or tell someone immediately  Steve  I wasnt gonna snitch on him   I think thats what I remember him saying at least So I was very lucky nothing worse happened that night  Im assuming that the part where he was talking and I was not paying attention was him talking about his gun  to which I responded with  Have fun with that   My lack of fear must have made him lift up his shirt to show off said gun  and since I could not see anything I did not give the reaction that he wanted  Who knows  but I never saw that kid again after that,2501,470

898,hpyrqh,1,31,Marilyn Manson Gets Mad About Cigarettes First post here so hopefully I’m doing this right  Shouldn’t be too hard  right  Ok so here’s the story I work at a convenience store in south Texas  It’s like a mom and pop type shop  so it’s a single store  not part of a franchise or whatever  I’ve been working as a cashier here for almost a year  it’ll be a year in August  This happened about half a year ago or so  Honestly I can’t remember exactly when  I wasn’t the cashier involved but it happened when I was working  Anyway   I come back from break  or out of the bathroom or something  and I see one of our regular customers yelling about something  He’s a tall guy in his late ’s early ’s and goth  Think  Marylin Manson lite  He dresses in the same style  I’ve seen him in the store many times and rung him up a few times as well  but never really spoke to him  This particular day he’s yelling loudly about some cigarettes  He said they expired and he wanted a refund  At our store we are not allowed to do exchanges or refunds for tobacco products  The only exception is if they come back within like maybe ten or less minutes after buying it  and it’s unopened  And even then we don’t really do anything like that  So I guess it depends on the case  but I digress  So my boss tries to see the date at the bottom and can’t see what it says  it’s scratched off  Then he asks the guy if he has his receipt  He says no  So my boss is saying there’s nothing he can do  but he’s willing to give the guy another pack of the same cigarettes  for free  or maybe a lower price     Wouldn’t be a refund or an exchange  Sounds like a deal right  Not according to this guy  He started yelling about calling the cops on us and getting us shut down  My boss was done at that point and told the guy to go ahead and do it  but whatever he did  he’d have to leave the store before he did so  Then the guy said this “I’m going to call the—the—the  searches for word  ASPCA on you guys and you shut down ”I was laughing so hard after he left  He never did call anyone and he hasn’t been back since,2098,407
899,hpvn9d,1,18,No Haggling Here The pharmacy retail store I used to work at also had a photo department where I worked at a lot of the time  By the time I was hired they had stopped processing film in store  so we were basically just a glorified print shop  There were a couple touch screen monitors for customers to use so that they could upload photos and create an order for us to print  About half of the customers I dealt with had no idea how to use this machine  so I would walk it through with them until they understood  One day I was helping a woman at the monitor  English was definitely not her first language  so I was making sure to ask multiple times if what we were choosing to order was what she wanted  She said yes  even after I would point at the print size and amount of each print she had told me to order  I placed the order and started to print it Her order had a few x and x pictures  and x photos were around    each if I remember correctly  Most people did not pay attention to the pricing until checkout  but when I help people at the monitors I make sure they look at the total amount they have to pay before placing an order  That way they stay happy and we dont waste materials printing out photos people dont want to pay for  This lady still wanted all of her photos even though she was going to be paying quite a bit for her xs  In the case there is a mistake made when printing  or if someone does not want a certain photo  we do not simply throw it away  There is a special box we place the photos in that get sent to be shredded in order to protect the privacy of customers  So after I print out the ladys photos I bring them up to the counter and let her inspect them before paying   L   lady  Me   me L  I did not want these  pointing at x photos Me  You dont want any of them  I had made sure when ordering them that this is what you wanted L  No  I dont want  Only these  pointing at x photos Me  Okay Im a little frustrated at this point because I spent a lot of time making sure we understood each other  I just blame the language barrier and start to adjust her order so she is not charged for the xs  Then I take the x pictures and put them in the shredder box L  What happens to pictures if I dont buy Me  They get thrown away to be shredded L  I pay    then Me  So  you DO want the pictures L  Yes  but I pay    since they getting thrown away Me  No maam   we do not haggle prices here  If you want them you need to pay full price Lady ends up not buying the x photos  I couldnt help but think that the ladys plan the entire time was to try and get those photos for a significantly cheaper price,2704,518
900,hprxdh,1,144,How dare you give me the correct change  This happened   years ago  It was the weekend so the store was filled with people  My next customer was a middle aged woman with a short blonde hair cut  eyelash extensions that needed refilling  etc  She paid with cash and when I was about to give her change  she decided she didnt want one of the items anymore  So I refunded her the item  I gave her the change from the first transaction  original purchase  plus the amount for the item she returned  She looked at the money I gave her and said it wasnt right  I explained the whole process   you gave me this much   then you returned this item  the value of that item was this much   so this is what you get back   At this point she was adamant I was wrong and she was right  She did the whole dramatic sigh and eye roll thing and began talking very loudly  so other customers could hear   that I had given her the wrong change  I told her again that the amount I have given her was correct  One of my managers was nearby and told the customer that we can count all the money in the register to make sure the correct change was given  Side note  I have social anxiety  so being talked down to  in front of a whole line of customers   and then having her stand there and watch while I counted all the money in the register was horrible  I was shaking the entire time   As soon as my manager told her I had given her the correct change  the customer stopped looking at me and acted like I didnt exist  She directed her conversation only to my manager and made up excuses that she must have gotten mixed up  She then left the store  completely ignoring me  I guess an apology was too much to expect,1712,326

902,hplbvs,1,24,I Cant Understand You I used to work at a major pharmacy retail store until last year  I have many stories working at that place  so Ill probably be posting more soon The story starts off with a regular customer shopping in our store  He was always very serious looking and never responded when I greeted him at the cash register  like many do   so I just assumed that is the type of person he is and didnt think any more of it  We have weekly and monthly deals for tons of items in the store that we mark with tags  It specifically says on the tags that you can get the sale price if you have a rewards account with us  Many people do not read this  but it gets quickly solved when we explain at the register So one day I am ringing up the regular customer for some dish soap that is on sale  Before I can ask if he has a rewards account with us  to get the sale price   he starts to what I can only describe as yelling at me  but without saying a word   He is literally trying to noiselessly yell at me about something  pointing at the screen and using body language that gives the impression that he is very angry  I am utterly confused as to what is going on seeing as that he has never done this before  I apologize to him and explain that I do not understand what he is trying to say  His response is to keep repeating what he has already been doing  He stares right at me as he silently speaks  and since I am a terrible lip reader  I apologize to him again  It then clicks that perhaps the man is deaf or mute  since he was always so quiet in the past   so I quickly grab a pen and paper near me and ask him to write down what hes trying to say  He ignores this and continues to silently yell  I try to get him to write several more times before asking my coworker at the next register if she can read lips  She is also at a loss  and we now have a large line at our registers because of this guy  I finally tell him that I cannot understand him if he is not going to write anything down for me  as I cannot read lips  Then all of a sudden he blurts out about the price of the dish soap  I am now extremely pissed off because we just wasted a good  minutes trying to figure out what this guy is saying  when he could speak the entire time   I then have to explain that he needs a rewards account to get the sale price  as he should already know being a regular customer   and ask if he would like me to enter that in now  He refuses and buys the soap at regular price,2492,495

904,hpa6rd,1,146,I dont know how to email  cant you just do it for me   Our store allows customers to email their print jobs to a server which will then send back a code straight to their inbox and allow them to input it on the machine for quick and easy printing  All of this is fairly obvious  we have signs posted everywhere not to mention we tell everyone how to do it when they ask us  This is a SELF SERVICE option  any order placed with me  a full service employee  is done online or in person and it’s obvious you are expected to pay more for that service  We explain this to every customer Not only that but once you get to the machines it is printed clear as day on how to follow the steps  what the email is  and how to input the code once you get it  The steps are simple  Press your option  print   put your card in  select how you are printing  by USB or Email   put in your USB or your code  then print However  if you’ve ever worked retail  you know just as much as I how people DON’T READ Regardless  for the sake of customer service I swallow all these thoughts down and try my best to help A Woman comes in and tells me she needs to print from her email  I tell her how and she is almost immediately angry   W     “I don’t know how to use email  can you show me how ”   Me     “I actually don’t know your email or the service you use  you would have to find your documents and then I could—  W   “Why can’t you just print it ”   Me     “Well  you need to email it over to this first so we can access it and I’ll show you how to print it over on our self serve printers ”   W     “You have printers back there  just print it”   moves phone closer to me   Me     steps back slightly   “Unfortunately I can’t touch your phone due to   the rona   and this is our full serve area  If I were to print your documents there is a mandatory       upcharge to have them printed on the spot  You can come back at   time   to pick up your order if you’d want to waive that fee ”   W     “It’s one page  you can’t just print it  I need this now  I can’t wait”   Me     Trying to hide my frustration since this is the third time I’m having this conversation and I’ve got    jobs that need to be finished  Her    job doesn’t matter much to me    “No  I can’t ”   W     “Fine  how do I do it again ”   Me     tells her   W     “I can’t get it  something’s wrong ”   Me     looks to see that she is getting an error that she’s not signed into her email    “You just need to enter your passwo—”   W     “I DON’T KNOW MY PASSWORD” Me   stammers   “I don’t know your password either ”   W     “What good is that   My phone service just changed and my husband needs these documents printed so now I don’t have access to the right email but I NEED THESE DOCUMENTS” Me  “ Well you can just hit “reset password” and follow the—”   W     “No because it’s gonna try to text me the code and I don’t have the same phone service WHY DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND IT’S SO SIMPLE”   Me     trying not to hit this woman   “Ma’am  we are not your phone company  neither are we your email service  You are using our self serve area  I’ve done everything I can for you but this is something you will need—”   she goes to interrupt me but I raise my voice so she can’t   “—to solve  If you can’t access your documents  there is nothing I can do  I can’t print what’s not in front of me  I can’t pull it out of thin air ”   W     “Your job is to help me ” Me   “And your job is to have your documents ready to print  Now I have other customers I need to help  when you get your document ready I’ll be glad to help you ” At this point I just ignored her while she sat there and shouted every so often “ It’s still not working ” There was nothing I could do  every avenue I tried to go down to help her she blocked off  Besides  I had a line of six or seven behind her  I’m only one person and I can’t sit there for a half hour and play IT  That’s simply not my job She ended up calling the manager over who spent nearly two hours with her  only to find out those documents weren’t even in her email  She threw a fit  but I was so busy I didn’t get to hear it,4179,770
905,hp3tla,1,18,Tale from the Copy Shop  I’ve worked for retail for the past seven years and I’m glad to say I’m finally out  Which gives me the perfect opportunity to share some stories while working here  The good news is that I have a great relationship with my managers  so they are a bit more lenient on what I’m aloud to say  Seven years hardens you and makes your temper all the much shorter  To start this off  I live in an area where there is a lot of families – as in everyone drives minivans or used Toyota Camry’s  Most are dented and worn down since the area isn’t very rich  and practically no one owns the vehicle they’re driving  A father comes in with his kids in tow and briskly walks to the back of the store – our furniture section  He has five kids  ranging from oldest being around  or   to the youngest toddling behind no more than two years old  I’m working the copy area  however from my perch I can see straight back and I watch with horror as his five kids break off and begin running around the store  They start pulling product off the shelves and whack each other with it  expensive equipment too but they don’t seem to care  I don’t like this obviously  since everything they’re throwing around is going to have to be damaged out  considered too damaged to sell  or put back on the shelves neatly since it’s all laying on the floor  My supervisor doesn’t like this even more and I can see his face turning red The entire time the child tornado is making its rounds up and down the aisles  the father is intensely studying the chairs and holding up my other associate who is glancing back at me wondering what to do about the children  My supervisor finally has had enough when one of them tries to climb up the employee ladder  which is chained and situated against a far wall for the express purpose of NOT being climbed on  SUP   interrupting the conversation between my associate and the father  “Excuse me sir  could you please watch your children  They can’t be grabbing and throwing product off the shelf – thank you ”FATHER   “I’m trying to buy a chair  what do you expect me to do ” SUP  “ I don’t know  watch your kids maybe ” FATHER   looks to me   “I don’t understand  what do you expect me to do  I’m trying to buy this chair ” ME   “Watch your kids  they are wrecking our store ” FATHER   shushes his kids which gets them to settle down for all of  minutes My supervisor and I hear a crash and the toddler starts crying  Thankfully no one was hurt and they had just knocked down a heavy product which hit the ground and scared the youngest one  This sets off my supervisorSUP   “Sir I need you to watch your children  or you can leave ” FATHER   softly  “ What do you expect me to do” At this point we just kinda stare at him  since we just TOLD him what he needs to do SUP   “I’m not the one who chose to have that many kids ” This gets him to decide he wants the chair he’s been staring at and the other associate helps him get situated  I man the copy center as it got suddenly busy but my supervisor runs to help clean up and follows the group to make sure they don’t make any more mess on their way out  After they leave  I hear over this the radio SUP  “ Someone get his plate number ” MANAGER   “Why  what’s going on ” SUP   “He can’t fit the chair in the trunk of his Camry  so he put down the seats  made the kids get in the trunk and put the chair on the folded seats ” What the hell is wrong with people  Unfortunately  he was gone before the cops arrived   I never saw him again  so I wonder if someone along the line got him to stop,3623,663
906,hp15n1,1,5,Two injuries for the price of one This all happened today while I was at work  The people involved are ok  as far as I know  Fall   To give y’all an idea where this happened in the store I was at the raw meat section and the person who fell was by the cheese and breakfast sausage  I was doing my job filling orders when I heard a commotion coming from there  So as a good employee I walk fast over to see what is happening  When I got close one of the people yelled that someone needs to call   Freaked out at this point I sprinted over and saw an elderly woman on the floor bleeding from the head  Thankful she was fully alert and moving around and talking   Note  I didn’t learn this till later by another coworker that a  year old boy pushed into her knocking her over  It was an accident and the child was remorseful  The coworker that called  said “They are on their way  Op you should go find a manager ” So I did  I straight up ran to the managers office and saw one coming out and told them “To just follow me a customer is hurt ” She followed shortly after a pharmacy tech with a pair of the medical examiner glove on  The big boss of the grocery store I work at came in while the technician was talking to the customer and told me and my coworkers to go back to work and their handle thing from there  Last I heard about it the woman needed stitches and went to the hospital  Story   I was putting up my trolley after my shift and saw some elderly woman on the ground outside the store  I asked them if everything was ok and was told she just fell over  I looked under the woman’s head and noticed some blood and told them  So I went and got some paper towels and the same tech from earlier was already there  She told me to get big boss and I try and find him  Got no luck  The woman’s husband just drove her home because she didn’t want to call   Tl dr  two people got hurt and only one went to the hospital,1939,382
907,hov42y,1,9,You’ve got my computer  A couple of years ago I worked at an electronics store and  one evening  found myself cleaning the products after we’d closed  In our big  open store I had the whole floor to clean by myself after most of my colleagues had gone home  BANG   BANG BANG BANG  I looked up to see a smartly dressed middle aged gentleman rattling the locked front door  frantically trying enter the shop “LET ME IN ” he bellows ferociously “Hi  Sorry  but we closed about  minutes ago  We’re open as normal tomorrow ” I say as I look up from cleaning  This was a common mistake of passers by so I didn’t think much of it “YOU’VE GOT MY COMPUTER ”“Sorry ”“IN THE BACK  MY COMPUTER IS IN THE BACK   GO AND GET IT ”“Sorry but we’ve been closed since half  and everyone from the repair team has gone home  We’re open first thing tomorrow so if you come back then  we can help and sign it out for you ” I calmly explain through the door “Listen  I know you’ve got it  so just go in the back  get it for me and open this door ” he menacingly mumbles at a volume still audible through the door “I don’t know what else I can say  I’m really sorry but we are closed  We can’t operate when the shop is closed and staff are not here ” I reply  beginning to lose patience  I feared that I was going to have to explain to this person the very definition of the word ‘closed’ “I travelled half an hour to get here  and you’re telling ME that you’re not going to give me MY laptop which I KNOW you have  Is that what you’re saying ” the confused  angry man continues  This went on for a good few minutes  and it struck me that this man was actually not going to ask for my manager  Perhaps he suspected that his best shot of reaping the benefits of his epic  minute trek was to bully a shop floor employee into submission  I had no other option  I had to do an FRK  Full Reverse Karen   I told him that I was going to speak to the manager  As I walked the length of the store into the back  I could hear the gentleman exclaiming his fury to the world in hope that his needs would be miraculously fulfilled by the universe if he poured enough anger and bad language into his immediate surroundings  the outside of our electronics store My manager walked up to the gentleman at the door  patiently listened to his concerns  simply explained once that when the store is closed we cannot conduct business and told him that his only option was to return at a time when we are open  My account of events and the rage on the gentleman’s face were enough for my manager to see that his only option was to deliver the news and remove himself from the situation  As I resumed the cleaning of my devices  I could hear the gentleman bellowing with the might of Zeus about the ridiculousness of such a farce and that he would be having some serious words with head office the next day Finally  he retreated    as his terrified   year old daughter sheepishly followed him away into the night,3008,551
908,hotepi,1,0,Snow Tubing Hill Stories I work at an indoor snow tubing hill in a very popular tourist area  The entire area is extremely busy right now  us included  so I thought I would share a few stories of idiocy from my time here First  background  we have  positions in here  Ticket booth  gift shop  and the  spots on the hill  Bottom and Top Carpet  who work the conveyor belt that takes you up  helping people on off and checking time  Air  who makes sure everyone is seated in their tube correctly and pushes the button that sends you  and Bottom Hill  who helps people ferry dropped items off the hill and keeps people behind the fence and line of bags that separates the bottom hill area from the rest of the place so that people dont get hit  Bottom Hill is also supposed to give Air a thumbs up when theyre ready to go  but Air almost never pays attention to it and will send people regardless  even if theres someone visibly in the area The positions will be called by their abbreviations from here out  BC  TC  Air  and BH Im mostly working either BH or TC  Or first story comes from a day I was working BH Nowadays  i have developed the habit of standing near to the entrance to the BH area  so I can more easily catch people entering the area  However  I didnt do that yet at the time that our first story takes place  I do this because people are in this area when theyre not supposed to be a lot  People wander into there trying yi find where to go  kids go running into there when they get loose from their parents  and a lot of people stand up from their tubes  walk to the back of the area  and get set up to take pictures videos off their friends and family coming down This lady  however  came walking into the area  to directly in front of the exit to a lane  and got set up to take pictures of her son coming down I  of course  see this and go walking over to her and tell her that she cant be in this area  she has to stay behind the fence  She says that shes just trying to get pictures of her son  to which I say that thats fine  as long as shes behind the fence  because this area is dangerous  I have been hit standing at the back by the bags  She was right in front of the exit to a lane  She refused to move I told her that theyre not coming down until she leaves  which convinces her and she starts to put her phone away when she realizes that there person who was working Air that day has  indeed  pushed the button and they are currently on the way down  She gets set back up again and starts taking pictures  completely ignoring my protests that she has to leave the area I know that it could be my job if she gets hit  so I just walked to in front of her to block that from happening  Thankfully  the kid was small and didnt even reach me  but Id he was even  pounds  he probably woulda plowed clean through us both For the second and third stories  I was working TC  Theyre both pretty short  so Ill try to keep them brief Part of TCs job is making sure people stay on the conveyor belt once theyre on it until they reach the top  controlling the flow of movement through the top area  there are  rings that we can block off or open up depending on how busy we are   and ensuring nobody walks on the conveyor belt  A group of people came in  about  adults and  little kids  The kids looked to be around  or   and twins The twins were constantly stepping off to the side  walking down  jumping back on  and walking up  Wouldnt listen to me telling them not to at all  And not only did the adults from the group not tell them to stop  they started walking up it to  We were busy enough that I had it open to the second ring  and these people would just jump over the chain into the first  cutting in line and completely ignoring me telling them not to do that either After a little while  the manager had some business with the snow machine  which is out a back door from the top area  While he was up there  he saw them doing this and asked me what was going on  To which I said that Ive told them not to at least  times by then and they refused to listen  So he tries taking to them and they dont listen to him either at all  It was the first time Ive ever seen him get frustrated  But not even he has the authority to kick someone out unless theyre trying to stay a fistfight or something  so they got away with it all night The last story comes from last night  Similar to the previous  kid keeps walking on the conveyor belt and I have to tell him to stop a few times  But opposite to the last story  the kids mom actually controls him  telling him that if someone had to talk to him again  hes done  I told her that I really wished more parents would say that to their kids  She was extremely nice and the rest of the night with them went great,4836,928

912,hoo911,1,7,You break it  you buy it  A long time ago  I worked for a tiny  family owned candy store   One day I was working alone with the owner   He left for a bit for his lunch break  and  women came in with  small kids between them   They told the kids they could each pick out a lollipop   The moms continue to browse  and I saw  of the kids drop their lollipops on the floor   When they were done  one woman came up to the counter to pay   She said  “they broke these two   Can they just pick out two different ones  instead ”I was so caught off guard   If I broke something in a small store like that  I would pay for it   “You break it  you buy it ” right  Especially since these were just lollipops    it wasn’t going to break the bank or anything   After a moment of trying to figure out what to say to this woman  I blurted out  “if you did that  then some other kid that comes in here is going to get these broken ones ”I saw her face slowly turn from happy to steaming angry   She snatched the lollipops out of the hands of all the other kids and slammed them on the counter   She said  “come on  we’re leaving and NEVER coming back again ”  The other women looked bewildered and asked what was wrong  they hadn’t been paying attention to our conversation    She just reiterated “we’re leaving ” And they all left   I did feel bad after that  but I was sure I’d done the right thing   When the owner came back from lunch  I told him what happened   I knew he would tell me I’d done well and it would all be forgotten  but it was just the opposite   He said  “if you’re in a grocery store and you knock a jar off a shelf and it breaks  they don’t make you pay for it ”  To this day  I think back and don’t know what I should have done   If I took my kids in a small store and the broke something  I would absolutely pay for it  no question   It’s not the same as a large grocery store  but even there if my kids broke something I would feel responsible   But when you’re trying to make the customer happy  the cost of a couple of lollipops isn’t a big deal  I suppose What would you have done,2106,427

916,ho2lvg,1,77,Not the place to skateboard  This was about  years ago when I was the manager of a video game store  We were right next door to a place that sold haircare products in a box mall setup We would have an issue with the local school kids skateboarding on the sidewalk in front of our store  Even though  they was a skate park about  blocks away  A few times  a kid would not be paying attention and would run into an elderly lady leaving the neighbor store  The worst one  the poor lady was knocked over and broke her wrist  and had bruising on the side of her face  Her head hit the ground pretty hard The neighbour store manager and I talked and we agreed to ask kids to stop skateboarding the second we saw it  We would also let them know about the skate park    understood  and would go to the park  But this is a story of the   I was putting out stock on a quiet morning when I saw a kid go whizzing by on his skateboard  I stopped and watched for a minute to see if he was passing by  or not  Sure enough he is going back and forth  I popped out the front door and advised him about the skatepark and we dont allow skateboarding on the sidewalk due to accidents  He shrugs me off and walks away   min later  he was back with his friends  I advised them again  they shrugged me off  I got a call from the neighbour store manager  she said she told them the same thing  but they told her to  Fuck off  I then went to the front door as one of my regulars was coming in  I told the regular I would be a monet  he didnt care  I stopped one of the kids again and told him he cant skateboard here  same spiel as always   Due to some accidents  we dont allow skateboarding here  you are going to have to leave  There is a skate park  blocks north    Kid shrugs at me and walks back to his buddies I go back to my front counter because the regular was ready to buy his game  We finish the transaction and he walks to the front door  I see him stop at the door and pause for a minute  My immediate thought was he was watching for the kids and didnt want to get hit  He then whips the door open  but doesnt go through  and I hear this loud bang  He turns to me and says  Hey Rob  youre right  Accidents do happen when you skateboard in front of your store    and then proceeds to walk out  I grabbed some paper towel and walked to the door The kid was laying on the ground crying  and nose bleeding all over his shirt  I handed him a peice of paper towel and said   You guys should go to the skate park   I then wiped the grease stain left on my door and went back to work  Never saw those kids again,2620,514

922,hnrff1,1,22,I dont think youre a customer here    I work at a dry cleaner which is owned by my family  I have a lot of nice customers but theres a few because theyre wealthy  they like to treat me as if Im garbage or since I dont have as much money  they think Im not worthy to be talked to respectfully    To begin the story  a woman walks in dropping off her bosses clothes  She was on the phone and pretty disrespectful to begin with   Me   Hi whats your last name    I E  So I know whos clothes I have   Her  The last name is  M   Me   Im sorry  I cant find it  is your boss a new customer    Her  almost yelling   No  hes been going here for years   Me   Are you sure    Her  still yelling   YEAH  Im sure   Me  trying to avoid making her madder   My mistake  Ill just take them   She storms out   A week or two later  she comes back and her demeanor completely changes saying her bosses dry cleaner was someplace else and she dropped the clothes off at the incorrect place  my dry cleaners   She never apologized about her behavior which doesnt surprise me  This happened a couple of months ago but even today someone rudely accused me of  losing their clothes  when in reality it was under their husbands name  As soon as I mentioned this fact  their tone suddenly changed and obviously no apology Its tiring to be a party to this rudeness  In certain situations  such as the woman I dealt with today  I can somewhat understand why someone would be upset but its a bit tiring to be spoken to as if Im an enemy  Im merely trying to help people,1572,298

925,hnmn7u,1,8,Wrong entrance This happened about  minutes before writing this  I was on my unpaid  minute break  eating and chatting in the break room  when I heard the doorbell ring  This door bell was for an employee only entrance  so I figured I would let them in  As I came out of the break room and turn the corner to the door  I saw that they looked like a customer  I figured they might be with a third party selling things in our store  set mywent to go ask what they were doing  As soon as I open the door  they asked  “ is this the entrance to the pharmacy ”As I said just a bit ago  the door she went up to was the employee only door  It’s how employees get in and out of the building when the store is closed  and it leads directly into an employee only area  I kindly told them that it was an employee only entrance  and luckily they understood and I gave them directions to the pharmacy that was inside the store,919,180
926,hnmdan,1,41,No Public Restrooms So about  years ago I worked at a candle store located in an outdoor shopping center  It was a slow day so my manager just had me straightening stuff on the shelves  This customer walks in and I go to greet her   M  me  C customer  SM store manager M  “Hello  can I help you find anything today ”C  “No but do you guys have a restroom ” M  “Unfortunately we don’t  but  insert store name across the street  has public restrooms you can use ”I went back to straightening shelves while the lady was looking around at candles  A couple minutes later I see her go up to the register where my manager was but didn’t have any items in her hand  Our store is pretty small so I could hear their conversation SM  “Hi  can I help you with anything ”C  “Hi  do you guys have a restroom ” SM  “Technically yes  but it’s for employee only  We don’t have restrooms open to the public ” C  “Oh  okay ”I then hear my manager say  “Uh ma’am  what are you doing ” At this point I look over because I’m wondering what’s happening  I see the customer is behind our counter right in front of the door to our back room C “You just said you guys had a restroom ”SM  “No  I’m sorry it’s just for employees only ” C  “Well I’m the only one in here can’t I use it real quick ” SM  “No  I’m sorry  It’s against policy to let non employees in the back room  I could get in trouble for that ”She then tells her there’s one across the street and after a few minutes the lady leaves  It just baffles me how people don’t listen and still try to do something even after being told no,1592,290
927,hnl6aa,1,68,A Customer Handed Me Drugs So this was when I  F  was new to my job at a popular convenience store in the north east  and I was on register  This was in  like  August of last year So a guy comes up and asks for a carton of cigarettes  No big deal  people ask all the time  and it was a popular brand  I took the carton out and told him his total  which was like  something dollars   and he proceeded to hand me a   bill that was folded I open the register up and unfold the bill to find what looks like a tiny bag of either cocaine or heroin  I didn’t know what to do so I kinda just slid it back on the counter for him to grab  The moment he realized I had the bag  it was like he got hit with a huge wave of anxiety  as he quickly took back the bag and started shaking  trying to complete the transaction as quickly as possible Coming from someone with really bad anxiety  I could tell he was thinking “is this teenage girl gonna call the cops on me” so the only thing I could say was “don’t worry  I don’t judge ”He got his change and BOLTED out the door  and I immediately washed my hands and wiped down the counter   everything I touched I told my mom  who works at the same store as me and was in deli at the time  the situation and she bursted out laughing  She said that even if they did call the cops  they wouldn’t have gotten to him in time,1369,272

939,hkqusn,1,9,A surprise customer About  years ago I was working at a little kiosk in a mall in Montana that sold custom T shirts   Most of our customers were tourists that wanted a shirt with “Montana” on it somewhere   One night  it was VERY slow   There was hardly anyone in the mall   Just before closing  there was a group of about  or  people that came walking past  when one girl stopped and told the group to hold up  she wanted to look at something   She asked me for a shirt with “Montana” on it   I showed her some of our most popular designs  and told her we could print the word “Montana” on any of them   She said she wanted something in a smaller size   I held up an adult small  and she said smaller   I thought  “ok  maybe she wants this for a kid she knows ”  I show her the kids’ shirts  and she picks up a pretty small one   She holds it up to her chest  pulls it tight  and asks her friend if she thinks it will fit   I tried to keep my chin from hitting the floor  I mean  this was a size for maybe a  year old   The friend was leaning on the counter looking extremely bored   I also noticed how remarkably short this friend was   She says  “whatever  just hurry up ”  I’m thinking  there’s no way she’s going to fit in this tiny shirt  but whatever   So then I have to help find her a print that will fit on a shirt that small that doesn’t look like it was designed for a toddler to wear   I showed her what I could find  but she didn’t like any of it   It was all too babyish  because  well  they were meant for young child   To make it worse  the friend was huffing and sighing and being so impatient and kept telling her  “LET’S JUST GOOOO ”  She finally gave up and they both left  along with the other guys who had been standing back not saying a word the whole time   As I started putting away all the shirts and prints I had pulled for her  I thought about how odd the whole episode was After they walked away  I saw a large group of people start running after them   One grabbed a pen and scratch paper off my counter as he ran by   As I watched this odd spectacle  all I could think was that maybe this was some important person they wanted autographs from   Then it hit me    there was a Christina Aguilera concert in town that weekend   Now I recognized her    the short  impatient “friend” at the counter    was her,2346,474

941,hknkqf,1,9,Irritated customer claims he can buy the store When I worked for a retail store a long time ago  I got to assist this customer   He needed to make two separate purchases of items and wanted to pay with checks   Fine  we accept checks   I go to make sure all the details were in order but on both checks  something felt off   Maybe its my unfamiliarity with check numbering but something felt weird I noticed that the check number on the top didnt match the bottom completely   It was one digit off   I let him know and Irritated Customer  IC  said that they came from his bank  etc   So I call for my supervisor and let her know what was going on and that I didnt process the checks because of the check numbers   Supervisor then asked him if his bank normally does this and IC  becoming well  irritated at this point  said that everythings legit   We ask him for his ID and he produces it   Supervisor then processes the two transactions separately During the first transaction  Supervisor let IC know that if his check bounces  he could be charged a fee   IC then argues with my supervisor that he has plenty of money in his bank account and isnt worried   Supervisor then has to repeat herself  saying that he needs to verify it on the pin pad and IC gets more irritated  saying that he has enough money and that he has enough to buy the whole store   Supervisor turns to me and rolls her eyes and finally convinces him to verify on the pin pad   IC still kept repeating to us how he had more money than the store and that he could buy the store if he wanted after we rang him up for his second purchase,1616,312
942,hkm9bp,1,49,The time a customer made me cry on my birthday I dont give permission for this to be shared or used by anyone else On my phone so please forgive formatting and mistakes BACKGROUND When I was at university I worked a few summer jobs over the years until I got an engineering internship which led to a part time job One of these summer jobs was a manager for a cafe inside a large British homeware shop starting with a D and at the beginning I thought it would be great as I was told it was shift work so I would only have to work  hours a day or so for  days a week However it turned out that the cafe was the most understaffed department with only  of us so we would have to work  hours a day and no one wanted to transfer to the team as it was known for being stressful  But hey more money right On to the story  As the cafe was small and the kitchen smaller  we could only cook a small number of paninis and toasties which led to queues and backlogs in the summer weekends On one of these weekends it was so bloody hot me and staff kept ducking into the kitchen to stand next to the fridge to cool down and tempers were short Cue Karen  She came up with her grandkids and started complaining how there was nowhere to sit and other people were getting their families to save tables while they queued which apparently wasnt fair  I informed her we didnt police the seating area and it was a busy weekend She scowled and handed over her food and then started hovering around an elderly couple until they left to grab their table Now  we usually give a small side salad with paninis and toasties but we were so busy we had ran out and only had tomatoes and cucumbers and so I plated up her food and dropped it off at her table and made my way back to the till She came marching up to me and starting yelling at me for trying to stiff her and how everyone else had salad leaves and that how stupid I was that I couldnt even put leaves on a plate All the while her grandkids where complaining they were hungry and just wanted to eat I apologised  explaining the salad was free and we were out of leaves but she wasnt having it and just kept yelling until I was on the verge of tears When she saw this I think she realised the scene she was making and deflated slightly before taking the food and leaving the cafe I had to excuse myself to the back storage room and had a cry as I had never been exposed to such anger over something so stupid This was the only retail job where I was screamed at and I still cant understand it,2557,486
943,hkf89s,1,0,This week I met a male Karen  First story I decided topost on here First of all I work in a bigger construction store here in Germany  trained in the gardening section and now stuck being a cashier So last wednesday  I was working my usual shift and waiting for a customer to show  It was a usual day of idiots and nice people showing up every now and then  Since they werent storming in and I didnt have any people waiting in line at the moment  I sat down and crossed my legs Then it happens and this guy shows up  being a bit rude and not greeting me back  when he reached my counter  I didnt mind it  because usually people are less talkative with those face masks  He places his only item on the counter and I scan it  ask him if that was all he wanted to buy and he angrily grabs a bag and almost slams it onto the counter  I scan that also since bags are  cents each and tell him his total  Be whips out his card and pays In the meantime I opened the bag  since they are usually a pain to open  But I didnt place his item  A bigger canister with a carrying handle  inside the bag  but asked him  wether I should hold the bag open for him  so he could place it inside easier Cue the Karen start up  From now on Ill be referring to him as MK  Male Karen  and me is me  S for supervisor and B for Boss  MK  You know thats your job  not mine Me  I give him a puzzled look MK  Packing my bag is your job  despite all the Corona non sense  Me  For further clarification  My counter is protected by a glass window with a small space underneath where I can grab and turn items to scan them  That also makes it really hard for me to pack items into a bag  despite it not being my actual job  Im sorry what  MK  Packing my bag is your job  And stop rolling your eyes The costumer is always right  You should know that  I am a sales trainer  I know what your job is  but you apparently dont Me  Alright  You should also know that it is not my job  Also  only as long as you behave  I will treat you with respect MK  Call your boss here now  I will wait  Also your sitting position tells me  you dont even wanna do your job  You arent interested in doing your job at all  like those damn people your age are anyways   I am a  year old female  but I appear to be a bit younger Me  Gadly   I start calling my boss  who said he was busy and couldnt come there now  so I should call my supervisor  Which I did At this point in time a line starts building in front of the register and MK tells the customers to walk up front to a different register  because  This will take a long time  I am not moving So my supervisor was busy at the entry and taking care of other peoples problems and told me to send MK to the front I told MK  that my supervisor was waiting at the front for him and should go there MK  No  it is my right as a customer  I demand someone to come to me  I will not move The customers told MK to move aside so I could do my job and he just placed his hands on the counter to further make clear he wont move So another worker and I start calling the boss again  because this guy wont move and keeps verbally attacking me Me  on the phone looking around the section  Usually Boss is walking around in the gardening section  but I dont spot him MK leans around my glass wall and stares at my face Me  lowering the phone from my ear  Excuse me  but what I am looking at is none of your business MK  The only thing thats missing now is that you start crying Me  Alright   I hang up the phone and stare at him  Telling the customers in line that I am sorry  but I am unable to work with this guy in my face MK suddenly turns around and starts walking out of the store in a fast pace  Then my boss arrives B  Wheres the customer you called me here for earlier Me  Just saw you and left B  Mustve not been that important then  Boss left Customers in line were sorry for me having to deal with MK and kept telling me  that he was at fault and just rude towards me And that concludes the story of how I met a male Karen  demanding the manager  talking about his right as a customer and so forth,4175,795
944,hk7egt,1,19,Underwear in Dressing Rooms   My friend told me some of the craziest retail stories when he worked at a Department Store  which is no longer in business   This one  is probably the craziest one ever  It was in the early s  He was working at the Kids Department  A mother and her  year old son   NOT a Karen   flagged him at the dressing room and said there is a problem On the floor of one of the dressing room was a boy’s white underpants  They looked at each other  “Are you going to pick it up ” The mother said “I need to get a glove first  Who knows if that thing is dirty or not  I’ll call my manager  Please don’t touch anything ” He told her  and walked away He later returned with the manager as he picked up the underpants and place it in a bag  He was surprise that he saw that the mother was still there  “Sorry for the wait ”Later  another customer approached us holding an open package of boys white briefs and asked  “Why are we selling open package of underwear  with one pair missing ”At this point  they figured out that an idiot customer open a package of underwear  have them try it on in the dressing room  and then left it there ”The boy asked  “Who does that ” Everybody shrug  Needless to say  my cousin’s manager was very upset for this strange theft  Or whatever you call it,1320,241
945,hk5u1z,1,23,Got yelled at for asking a customer to maintain his distance A couple of days ago I was at work  I’m a cashier at a garden centre  I get this old man and lady come to my till  I’m guessing he’s    The first thing out of his mouth is that he wanted something out of the locked cabinet  Now only a few people are allowed to have the key as it contains chemicals and poisons  and its mandated by law that the person taking the item out of the cabinet has to tell the customer how to use it I attempted to tell him that while I don’t have the key  I can call someone who can help him  I got as far as saying “I can’t”  before he began to yell at me  He was saying that it says to ask a cashier  aren’t you a cashier  Now I hate to be interrupted  I think it’s rude  So immediately I’m pissed but I’m trying not to show it  I tell him that I was trying to tell him I’ll get help for him  I proceed to call  the lady runs off to get what they wanted  and I continued to ring up the rest of their items  I did have to tell him after the initial yelling to please stand behind the bright yellow line that’s in place for where customers need to stand  I could tell he didn’t like being told that  but he complied  Btw he was not wearing a face covering  you know the word the starts with an m and ends in a k  While I was bagging their things and standing to the side of my till where there’s no plexiglass  the old man decided that was the right time to take his basket and place it beside me where one other basket was  At no point during this  did he stay away the recommended distance As I say to all customers who think they can be closer to me than my own kids  I said please stay behind the yellow line  With that he freaking loses it  and yells at me that he had to put away his basket  I told him not to yell at me  that it was for his safety and mine  He doesn’t say a word  The garden centre manager comes up to me and asks if I was alright  I said yes  she goes up to him and reiterates what I just said  Of course there’s no mention of him yelling at me The lady with him never said a word about his behaviour to him or me  I’m wondering if he’s abusive to her too and her way of coping is to just ignore it Please  when shopping  pay attention to where the lines or X’s are  They are there for a reason  Yes I know this is a strange new world  and we have to learn a new way to shop  but don’t yell at the employee when asked to do something  The rules are there in place,2497,509

949,hjt41w,1,0,Kid coughs directly into my face Hi  this is my first post in this section so please let me know if I mess up on formatting or names I work in a bookstore in Australia which didn’t have to shut down during the outbreak  We’re currently in a second wave right now which is making things difficult A woman came in with her child and proceeded to pull every Bluey book off the shelf  if you don’t know the character  it’s a current cartoon on tv that kids are going crazy for  so he could look at them  And  by look  I mean rub his hands over all of them  cough and generally be gross  Note  the child was about  or  so I don’t have issues with him not understanding the gravity of the situation The mother was a talker so brought me over to talk about the books  She then launched into a complaint that the kindergarten his little sister went to hadn’t taught her to read and write yet because “that isn’t my job  it’s theirs ”I nodded  pretending to look interested  She picked her son up and held him on her hip  She then complained about his school not having enough “screening” for any sick kids coming in and that her son had gotten sick from one of the other students who had the flu I basically became that side eye meme where I looked at him and then back at her   I have asthma and I live with someone who is high risk when it comes to the current virus so I’ve had to be very careful The child looks straight at me and coughs  Not just a small cough or with any attempt to cover his mouth  Just a straight  chunky cough right into my face  his mother wasn’t really adhering to social distancing either so it was a real face full   I look at his mother in shock and she says  “See  Sick ”I had been expecting her to tell him to cover his mouth or turn his head away  We were in the middle of a pandemic after all  or at least from basic respect for other people  I don’t blame the kid because he was young and when things haven’t been explained or they haven’t been told not to do something  it’s not an action he’d fix by himself at that age She had the gall to complain about the other kids not being screened but had no issue with her kid spreading a virus  I asked if it was “just the flu” to see if he’d been tested and she waved it off about all this “virus drama”  She wasn’t attacking me but was acting like the world was “crazy” for not wanting to get sick So  to protect the bookstore  myself and the people I live with  I had to go get tested Thankfully  I was clear even though I did end up with a rotten cold from the situation It was just so shocking to me that she didn’t care what he had or if he was spreading it  Good thing was that she bought a few books which really helped the bookstore out so I can’t complain about that,2774,532

954,hjfaw0,1,3,Trying to spice up retail backfires This was several years ago  I was working in a supermarket at the tills checkouts  This  as Im sure many of you know  is a fairly dull task and chances are youre stuck there for hours  For context  I have a strong British accent  This was a fairly small shop and we mostly just get regulars buying their weekly shopping One day I decided on a whim to try something new  When the next customer I didnt recognise came up to me to be served I said  Hello  Welcome to   supermarket    how are you today   I said in the first accent that came to mind  It was Russian  I am not very good at this accent The lady gave me an odd look before answering  She didnt have many items so it didnt take very long to finish the transaction  but there was enough for a small conversation to be necessary  Thank you  have a nice day  I said in a  Russian  accent that had by no means improved since my first attempt  The lady mumbled some thanks and left the shop  I decided that I would definitely not be trying that again  it was pretty awkward Fast forward to tomorrow  Im working my magic at the tills when the same lady comes in and buys some more things  Im far to stubborn to admit I was faking it so when she greets me I don a hopefully not too dissimilar accent to yesterday  Hello again  how are you today   Yup  still a terrible attempt  What an idiot  Im exhausted  My husband and I have just moved in to the area and are very busy unpacking at the moment  I expect Ill be in here a lot more often as I live just around the corner    amp  xB Anyway  long story short I doubled down and carried on with the accent for the remainder of my time in that shop  I can only imagine the confusion of anyone standing behind her in the queue when I greet them in perfect English,1828,335

958,hj19p2,1,12,The shoe show Many moons ago I managed a womans shoe department in an upscale department store  This was back in the s  so lots of high heels to be had there  Most ladies would try on a few pair  and buy one or two  typical shoppers  And then there was HIM Not long after I started this young man came into the department  wanting to see  or  different pair of what we called CFMH  come f  ck me heels  in a size   biggest size we carried   I wasnt there to judge  just make sure we made our quotas for the month  so I wander in the back room and grab the shoes  He shoves his bigger than size  feet into the shoes and totters around  They apparently were not what he wanted  so he proceeded to try on the rest  Then decides he doesnt like any of them and leaves  OK  kinda weird  but whatever  He comes back a few weeks later  same deal  Wants a bunch of CFMH in size   tries them all on  totters around and leaves after buying nothing Third time my supervisor from the head office is in the department  he stopped by once a month or so  cause the head office was  hrs away on the other side of the state   Shoe boy wanders in  starts grabbing a bunch of CFMH heels and starts walking to me  Which is when my supervisor grabs the shoes  turns shoe boy around and marches him out the door as I stand there confused Turns out shoe boy NEVER bought shoes  He had some sort of shoe fetish  and since I was new  I didnt know who he was  Ugh  There I was  trying to be nice to a potential customer who turned out to be only coming in to get his rocks off  I   really   dont miss retail,1603,313
