0,p9jb15,0,1,Went no contact with my dad and wrote an email stating that he needs to get help for his condition  This was his response  Im so mad and just feel utterly hopeless about him ever changing  For the time I saw my dad as he truly is and that he will never acknowledge my heartache and the abuse I and my siblings suffered at his hands  Despite this  I still cant shake this stupid  learned behavior that I need to consider my dads feelings while he can walk all over mine  My letter outlined  with specific examples  the negative impacts on my life hes had  I was homeless at  and he didnt once think to reach out and see how I was doing or offer to help   out of  of his kids have now decided to go no contact with him  Anyways this was his response nothing to be It is very difficult to respond to your letter   Your letter covers two decades of heartache that I was unaware of  and has me grieving the loss of our relationship that never was The pain described in your letter and your decision to go no contact leaves me deeply saddened  Especially now… as you said there are many things left unspoken between us Your letter was heartfelt  well written and triggers a sense hopelessness in me  With so much content to process all I can say right now is I love you nothing to be We live in difficult times that are hard to navigate  The world today is so much different than it was in the recent past  All this is driving a need within me to reconnect with God  Who unfortunately  I’ve been running from since my darkest years that culminated in divorce from your mom In your letter you describe your experiences and memories  those  belong to you and you alone   That’s how your memories feel to you  that’s how you remember them  Also in your memories you presume to know my thoughts  Those don’t belong to you  you can’t possibly know my inner thoughts and motivations  I would go so far as to say you don’t really know me The absence of hate isn’t love nothing to be  I wish things could be different between you and me  Maybe we could talk about it someday  You have had a long time to consider this and have your reasons  I respect your request for autonomy  So  until my heart is right with God and He influences my path  I will need time before I can willingly consider action that further contributes to the sadness and vulnerability I feel today I love you nothing to be …dad,2414,437
1,p9j3h2,0,1,I just can’t get a break I recently had to move back in with my nparents with my dog  There’s also two siblings that live with them that are in elementary school  They acted nice at first trying to push me to move in with my friend but my friend said there was too much going on with their family and house so understood  I told my nstepmom cause she was saying before that they would be happy to give me a place but the moment she received the news she flipped sides and showed that she didn’t want me here  She gave me a lot of stipulations while saying “but you’re an adult so it’s not like you have to do all the things you did as a teenager” but she manipulated me into rehoming my dog saying she only wanted the best for him but she actually just wanted me to get rid of him and didn’t give me other options  She eventually put me in a situation where I had to stay at a friend’s house while I figured out a home for my dog  I ran out of time so I just had to leave my dog at my friends’ and they said they’d help me and figure it out for me in order to take it off my hands  I came back to my nparents’ house today without the dog and my nstepmom accused me of dumping him on the side of the road  when I got home she ignored all my texts asking if she was home and when my little sister tried to talk to me my nstepmom wouldn’t let her and yelled at her  I feel like later in the evening they’re going to sit me down for an old fashioned talk where they just make me feel like scum and probably to tell me that I need to find somewhere else to live  All the while my dad never says anything  I’m really afraid cause I’m starting to feel like they’re watching me  I wouldn’t be surprised if they found out about this post,1729,353

3,p9izcv,0,1,Answering  yes  I know it seems so trivial  but Ive gotten comfortable with answering  yes  when doctors  therapists  etc  Ask me if I have a history of abuse as a child  I have MDD w psychotic features  anxiety  and a possible personality disorder  in the process of being tested and diagnosed   so I get asked that a lot by professionals  For a long time I said  I dont think so   because I wasnt really sure  Separating from my nparents  and this community in part  thank you all  has helped me understand and accept that I went through emotional abuse for  years Heres to progress  friends,604,104
4,p9iu6r,0,1,In a couple hours Im going to talk to someone outside of my family about my Ndad for the first time  In pretty nervous and kind of scared  My dad is very nice to everyone except for my family  Everyone likes him and people always tell me how lucky I am to have such a great dad  This is one of the many reasons why Ive never told anyone  but Im going to do it now One of the things that Im scared of is that they wont believe me  My dad always tell me that no one cares about me and they just pretend to tolerate me to be nice  Plus  wow  a teenager complaining about one of their parents  What a surprise  In my head Im pretty sure theyll believe me because theyre a good person  but my whole life of getting threatened so I dont tell anyone and  well  all the other stuff hes done has me pretty scared Im also scared that I wont be able to explain things properly  Ive only talked about this to my siblings before and they know already so theres no need to explain the abuse  Im always really bad at explaining things and Ill also probably be crying a lot  so Im not sure how well I can make the situation clear  Ive been thinking about this for a while and Im getting pretty anxious  If you have any advice then thanks a lot,1257,243
5,p9ipag,0,1,I need help and I don’t know where to go My name is Ana  and I need someone to give insight into my predicament  I am  and last year I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and binge eating disorder  I have been struggling for a while  and my parents sometimes lash out on me  A few months ago  I was in my bedroom crying when my father got mad that I was being loud and he slapped me  This has happened a few times in the past few months  Last night  I wanted to move some workout equipment to my bedroom so that I could work on my health and make myself feel better  My mom told my father to help me because the equipment is heavy  He came to the basement to help but did not want to move the equipment  I told him that was fine  I can do it myself  He refused and I calmly expressed the benefits of the action and how I get that he is tired  but I truly don’t need his help  He got angry and proceeded to drag me upstairs  I tried to not be dragged  so he got frustrated and threw me to the floor  He proceeded to bash my head and started kicking me while I was on the tile floor  I only have some bruises on my left arm  What do I do  Is this considered abuse  Or is this normal behavior for a parent educating their child,1236,251
6,p9iosp,0,1,im  and my dad locked me out the house because i went to recieve food delivery  im  and today i went outside to recieve food delivery and i was sneaking out because my dad was against eating take out food because of covid  so as i was leaving the house  i told my mom i was gonna buy a soda from the next door store  and i heard him screaming just as i was opening the door that she shouldnt have let me go outside  bc it was sunset   amp  starting to get dark  but he still does this even when its daytime   when i came back home  he didnt let me in  and i heard him threatening to hit me and he locked the door  so i had to enter from the other door  and lock myself in my room bc i was scared of what he might do  i still didnt even eat my food  and whats worse is that im feeling like i did something wrong,825,172
7,p9iefo,0,1,I Feel Like I Have Been Avoiding My Past Really been thinking about how my mom treated me and still does  She has never apologized and I think I just accepted this  Even accepting the behavior because I have to right now  Everytime I talk about what still bothers me  she doesnt actually listen  Just says  Im sorry you feel that way   Then pretends I am not angry anymore  I dont even confront it anymore  I think I just stopped thinking about all her unacceptable behavior  She still bothers me When I came out she told me I wouldnt find love  I am trans  because of how my body  mostly my genitalia  would look unattractive  Then when I tried to tell her how damaging that was to my self esteem  she denied it  Then downplayed how badly it still affects me When I told her I was depressed  she took me out of therapy and then when I tried to hurt myself because I didnt have any way to freely express myself without being yelled at  she yelled at me and told me I was doing this all for attention I keep wondering why I had accepted this  Why I wont tell her off anymore  I am still hurt  Really hurt and Im concerned that she will do the same to my son  but I wont go after her for it  I mean  I want to hash this all out but she wont be the adult and listen  Accept she was ever wrong  Then genuinely apologize  I had a really  really rough time in school when I came out and I couldnt go to her,1417,271
8,p9ids2,0,1,How can I explain it to my aunt I have an aunt who for awhile was my favorite aunt  When I was little I explained how awful my mom was and she brushed it aside  A few years ago it seemed like she actually saw the real her   Recently my mom got in contact with me  I told her shes sick  to leave me alone  and stop bothering me  Shes spun it to me cursing her and my brother out  Even if he is the GC I wouldnt do that to him  Never cursed her out ether   My mom even had the audacity to even try and gaslighting me  Saying everything is in my head My aunt unfortunately is convinced that Im doing just that and suggested it might be some kind of mental issue with me  I know what I went through  Gaslighting  dismissal  blame scapegoat  verbal abuse  etc   Is there anything I can do to convince her,808,161

10,p9i7l9,0,1,mourning whats to come so my nmom has been acting weirdly nice to me lately  my nparents and little siblings just got back from a week of camping  and its  days until my partner comes out to visit and meet my family for the first time  so my nmom is currently over in the twin cities for a wedding  and stopped at ikea today  she texted me a picture of a nightstand  saying i know youve been looking for some stuff for your bedroom lately  im currently in the process of completely renovating my bedroom  and thought you would like this  i can get it for you if you want to which i said sure  that would be nice  she also told me i could look at bedding on the ikea website and she would get it for me if they had it at the store  and i sent her a set that i liked and she got it for me  i may also be getting a new tabletop for my desk  which is well past due for an upgrade i keep on asking myself  whats the catch  the ikea in the twin cities is the only one thats anywhere near where we live  and we dont often go to the twin cities  so this is kind of a big deal for my mom to be doing this for me  its incredibly rare for her to be so kind it makes it even harder  because when she acts like this  it brings my walls down and makes me forget the terrible things that shes done  it makes me forget her screaming at me that she regrets ever having me  her taking my phone away for months on end  her finding a certain handful of videos on my phone that were meant for my partners eyes only  as in nsfw lewd videos that i took when i was still a minor  also that was an abusive relationship i am no longer in  but the point is she wasnt supposed to see those videos    and screaming at me about the videos  her slapping me straight in the mouth when i talk back  her leeching me of my hard earned money because of past expenses  her acting this way makes me regret wanting to go nc with her my current plan of attack is to move out sometime next year and move in with my partner over on the east coast  away from the midwest and anywhere near my mother  once i move  i plan on going nc with her  i dont want her to be able to contact me or my partner  she isnt getting an invite to our wedding  she doesnt get to know her grandkids  its just incredibly frustrating when she acts so kind to me  because it makes going nc that much harder  but im hoping that i stay strong  and that i go nc with her as planned,2449,486
11,p9hyp7,0,1,She HAD to make sure I left on HER terms  I’ve just realised that my mother making me homeless   months ago was simply a power move  She did it because she saw that I was finally making steps towards independence  I’d already told her that I wanted to move out and didn’t know if I’d be able to speak to her after I did  She had the nerve to act confused  as if she hadn’t spent the past  years calling me names  telling me I was the reason for everything bad in her life  telling me that she didn’t care if I lived or died because she’d cared for too long  telling me how pathetic I was and that I needed to grow up and get a life whenever I would have a panic attack  She kicked me out  temporarily closing the business I had been doing well with out of necessity  because she couldn’t bare the thought of ME leaving HER  Congratulations to her  She ‘won’  Now she finally has one less daughter  just like she always wanted,933,181

13,p9hm9u,0,1,I keep getting into fights with my step mom  what do I do  So I’m  and have recently moved home for  months  I live with my stepmom and my dad because I can’t really go anywhere else  Anyways  I work   hours and I will admit I could talk more when I come home but I’m beyond exhausted after work  Tonight I got into an argument with my step mom  and she was mocking how she’s also always tired  and how she also has things on her plate  She said she doesn’t ever wanna eat one on one with me again  she isn’t gonna cook for me and doesn’t wanna see me  I phoned my dad because he’s abroad until tomorrow and he said it’s my fault and I don’t deserve an apology for the things she said because she’s tired of my behaviour and that’s why she said it  I told him that’s no excuse for those things  that I’m really hurt and that I’d like an apology  but that I can see the way I handled it wasn’t very handy  I’m just so beyond tired of asking for some respect and for them to see things from my POV  I can feel myself slipping into depression again  as well as having some bad thoughts  I can’t really go nowhere but I don’t really know what to do anymore,1158,232

15,p9hgiw,0,1,Im ignoring my ndad and now hes asking if I will visit him in the afterlife  Like fuck go away already  If your going to heaven  then Ill take hell  Just fuck off  Ive tried to have a relationship with him  I tried my best  I tried too much and spent too much time wasted  All he wants to do is shame  guilt  fear monger  talk about money  criticize  and whatever else thats negative    ALL THE TIME ALL THE TIME  He says he needs us to help with his business  we tried and he just used it to start arguments and fights and drama He said he needed help with his health and it was just to start arguments  fights and drama  He lies about things SOOOOO MUCH and I think its to start fights  arguments and drama  I swear he needs this negative energy to survive So if I ignore him will he die,814,151
16,p9hg12,0,1,When my moms brother died I had be the one to tell her I was   in my senior year of highschool when I got a call on my cell at pm  My mom  brother and I were eating dinner and my dad was at work  I’ll never forget  it was my uncles ex wife calling to tell me my uncle had died and to give the phone to my mom  To this day I’ll never understand why she called ME  But she did  My heart dropped as I handed the phone to my mom and delivered the news  She threw the phone across the room and broke down  I had to take charge of the situation  get my mom and brother in the car and drive us to the hospital where my uncle was  On the way I called my moms best friend  my dad  my aunt and other siblings to let them know what was going on  I had to console my mother and waited for other family to arrive with us at the hospital  It was so odd seeing his body  Looking back it was so traumatic for me that I had to be the grown up in this situation  I had also just lost my uncle  my godfather  the man who I always felt cared about me and was there for me in my life,1066,229
17,p9h41c,0,1,Dreaming of narc grandma Three years ago I started noticing the mask falling off of my narcassitic grandmother  I went no contact for a number of reasons  Major reasons • My mom had me at  and tricked into signing over guardianship to my grandparents  • I didnt meet my biological dad until I was  because my grandparents threatened to literally kill him  They held him at gun point  For  years my grandparents said he was a consistent drug addict and that he cheated on my mom  He wasnt  He is very stable  only smoked pot here and there through high school  Dad was a cop who suspected my mom was being sexually abused by grandpa  which she was  I believe this is why they actually ran him out of town  • I always confided in my grandma as a child about my step dad abusing me  My grandma lied to everyone and told my mom nothing was happening despite my constant confessions of abuse  I was abused for  years     When I was a teen  my grandma gave my mom constant advice for my  acting out   Resulted in a lot of beatings and different medications that led to a drug problem  Grandma was playing both sides of the field by telling my mom I was a rebellious teen and telling me that my mom didnt love me and that she was always there for me to act on my behalf  Learned all of this at  after I went no contact after meeting my dad  My mom also went no contact and we got closer    despite her being a terrible mother for years  Thats another post for another day  •  months after having  contact  I started having terrible nightmares of abuse that happened before I was  or   I was wetting the bed and waking up screaming  I had such an abusive childhood that I blocked so much out for years  Went to therapy and added another abuser to list  There is honestly so much more and I feel like I could type all day  I just wanted to give a little background Im having what feels like nightmares because in my dream Im talking with my grandparents and either defending my experience or my moms  Its like its in the future and I know she is narcissist but Ive given her another chance  We talk about the years I didnt talk to her and then we just carry on  I feel like Im going crazy  Last night I dreamed that my grandma had convinced me that I was wrong about her being a narc and I missed time with her  It was like all of the love bombing wasnt love bombing and it was real  Like I woke up thinking  what if she really wasnt that bad and Ive cut out the only person that ever cared for me growing up   Ive been stuck on the couch all day with racing thoughts  My only way to cope with this kind of thinking is to remember every little fucked up thing shes ever done  Has anyone else experienced this,2748,523

20,p9gwco,0,1,How can I get financial independence from my N mom who has a gambling addiction  My mother is addicted to gambling  she does it every night  All of my paychecks that I earn go to her account ever since I was  and started working  I know I should start my own account and I did create one  but when I told her I was going to transfer my money she is threatening me saying she will charge me for “rent” living in her house  and this rent would basically be my full paycheck because she is going to steal it all anyway    I’m  and a full time college student  she apparently does help pay my college but I have no idea where my own money goes because she only has access  She has isolated my family from all other family members and I have no friends since I can rarely afford to go out because she controls how much of my money I can spend  She also controls my father’s money  he makes around k per year and we still live in a run down tiny house and he has no idea how to pay a bill and my mom controls it all  How can I get out of here when she takes all my money and I’m left with nothing  I have no car and nothing of good value that belongs to me that I can sell  I’m sorry I sound so stupid but if I ask my mom about financial things she insults me and my dad has no idea how to do any of it he’s given up  I feel like ending my stupid life is the only option  I feel like I am a slave she uses to support her gambling addiction and I feel like there’s no way out  Idk if this is the proper sub but please if anyone can help me please,1547,320
21,p9gtde,0,1,Should I go no contact   Read in full if you give an answer  Ill try to keep a long story short but not spare important details  Essentially  I feel disrespected and pushed around by my siblings constantly  so much that I had to tell my mother because she caught me on the verge of a literal breakdown last month  When I told her about how my siblings were making my fight or flight flare up more and more  she essentially said  get help  and nothing else  I asked her multiple times to talk with my siblings  she said yes  which later turned into her not wanting to because  It makes her anxiety act up to get involved in drama   I told her I felt like if I were to become so bad mental health wise and end my life  I dont have these thoughts  just a hypothetical  that nobody would know how it got to be that bad  She said itd leave alot of trauma and that we should talk about it as a family  which never happened  because she said shes too anxious to bring us together to hash it out  So essentially  the massive split that caused me to tell my siblings to not talk to me anymore has never actually been resolved  Fast forward to us doing a family activity at the pool  Im minding my business rubbing in sunscreen when my sister aggressively tells me to stop standing over her  to which I calmly reply  Ill be away from you in a moment I just want to stretch and moisturize   My other siblings jump in  I calmly repeat and tell them Im not trying to make anyone uncomfortable and literally just want to do what I was doing before getting in the pool and being away from them for  minutes  In enters my mom  who scolds me in front of everyone  with more anger towards me than any of my siblings for any past aggression ever  I just feel beyond done  I plan on not sleeping in my home tonight because if I communicate why Im upset shell end up yelling and telling me Im  the problem child  then acting like nothing happened  Should I just go no contact  I already have the worst sibling blocked and Im not far behind adding the others to the list  Or am I overreacting  Please  be honest,2104,399
22,p9gs2e,0,1,Nstep mom thinks her future baby is my  obligation     My father and I have always had a fairly rocky relationship  especially after him and my mother  separated   long story short   years have passed without them actually divorcing  though theyre both  engaged  to other people   Shortly after their separation  my ndad found a woman who was pretty nice at first  Since I was only  and my mother had moved out of state with her new  husband   I latched onto my new stepmom and was quite happy to have a  mom  figure to look up to  She didnt even seem to be a narc at first  though being with my ndad soon changed that  I think its called fleas  and both my nmom and now nstep mom have them  since they exhibit traits similar to the way my ndad has always been  but only after spending enough time around him    So  my ndad came into my room one day  right at the start of the Covid waves  last year  late winter  early spring  He screamed at me and my so for being lazy  and preceded to tell me hell be taking my door off the hinges to give me a reason to come out of my room  This was because me and my so were still relaxing at noon on a Friday  our school only went Mon Thurs   and were not yet up and cleaning his house     I still dont know what in me made me do it  but after years of putting up with him barging in or beating down my door to scream at me  that day Id finally had enough  and I asked my so if I could stay at his grandparents house for a few weeks     Though my nmom turned my life upside down from there  my nstep mom was the sole supportive family member  and had told me the whole   if thats what you think is best for you  then go ahead   line  So a year passed with me stuck at nmoms until Im almost    very long story  before moving back in with my so  where Ive spent the past ish months    The surprising thing is  though no one saw a problem with me not doing my senior year at my nmoms house  as soon as Id moved back with my so  my whole family just had to tell me how badly Id failed them for not sticking with school and   just hunkering down and getting it done   I quickly got my stuff together though  getting my drivers license and Ged within the first few months  though my nfamily all had the same sentiment of  a GED isnt nearly as good as a diploma  how are you supposed to get into college with that     Of all the family members disappointed in me  I was only surprised by one  Nstep mom tried to be  nice   while telling me every other sentance how much my little sister   a severely autistic  year old  misses me  and how I should come  visit  her on an all expense paid  vacation  Since my nstep mom used to understand how much stress and anxiety my family gives me  I was shocked when she blew up on me  and acted offended that I wouldnt accept her generous request    That happened a few months ago  and at about the same time she had sown the seeds for the title    yes I am getting there  but it makes no sense out of context       So my nstep mom and my ndad are living in ndads home city  a days drive from where I live  and I have no vehicle  Nstep mom came from where Im living now  so shes been quite out of her element in ndads big city  and  while we spoke on the phone  would make it clear she was unhappy there  She had no friends or family there  and deep down always wanted a horse  yes  a horse  Now  that wouldnt be a problem  except the fact that my ndad cant care for ANY animal  let alone children       Anyways  during a phone call with nstep mom  she had asked me how Id feel if her and my dad had a baby  Keep in mind  Im  and my father has ALWAYS treated me like a burden  not to mention told me that Ill be caring for  the little r tard   yes both my parents have always called my little sister that  I grew up thinking it was normal   So when my nstep mom said that  I had no clue what to say  and first stuttered out something like    sure  thatd be nice  I was in such deep shock I couldnt think  and I think  weeks passed before I texted her again   And once I did  she was even worse than before  She tried hard to guilt trip me about my sister  telling me how much she missed me  how shed been asking for me  and how hard it is to take care of her every other week  Dont get me wrong  I do miss my sister too and really want to see her  but putting pressure on me to come visit her on everyone elses time  while Im trying to get a job and save for a car    it just cane across as selfish  and after the baby thing      So I sent her a long paragraph explaining that  this is the reason we havent spoken in weeks  You put alot of stress on me and I cant really handle it right now     It honestly broke my heart the way she responded  she basically went on a long tangent about how SHE just wanted me to come and have a nice  vacation   and how she wouldnt be offering me a vacation like this again    I then reiterated that helping with my little sister and jumping through the families hoops is anything but a vacation  and for her to please stop offering it  I also  heaven forbid  mention something about how I dont have a support system down there and need to focus on getting support   All of this caused my nstep mom to seethe with rage  and she merely responded   I see    Me  Sorry I just dont like not telling people what going on in my head  since it is such a mess  and I know if my dad one half of what my life is he wouldnt accept it     No Im not a stripper  I just have a trans bf    Nstep mom  All I have to say is if you have to hide your life  you arent doing it right  Live a life you are proud to share with everyone  And last thing  a job or college arent the only paths to success  but they are the only options to survive  Dont make a fool out of yourself trying to prove everyone wrong   And lastly  dont worry I wont be a support system for you anymore since it seems I never was  Good luck on your own  maybe  sos dead name  will be able to help you adult  Im out Me  I mean  I have to hide it from the abusers Im related to  so theres not much I can do there  aside from that I am proud of my life  And of course jobs are necessary  no sh t  but I cant hack a full time right now and thats whats important  And what the f ck are you talking about  youve never been a support system   I mean that line speaks for itself  You were a good support system  but now youve become like my father and and I dont even know  youre thinking this is somehow an attack on you  And yeah  my boyfriend  sos real name  has made it easier and greatly helped me learn how to adult  as you used to before you were all full of obligations for me  I hope you are happy with my father  but after youimplied that I could stay with him for   months  I realized youre in a completely different headspace    After that  she sent a slightly shorter text about all the obligations of life  basically saying  Im sorry you cant handle having obligations   though what effing obligations is she talking about  Im obligated to drop what Im doing and help her care for my little sis AND her baby      Just wanted to post this cause  though Im used to my

25,p9glhv,0,1,My mom tried to gaslight her  year old son today  I have lunch with my mom from time to time  Not so much because I want to see her but mainly just to keep the peace with the family  The last time we had lunch we went to Olive Garden  It was good  no complaints  This time around I suggested that we go back to Olive Garden but she wanted to go someplace cheaper  But instead of just saying that she instead told me   Oh  not that place again  Do you remember how much you hated it and how bad the service was  Lets go someplace else   We didnt go someplace else because I stopped taking her calls  She can wait till next month and maybe Ill ask her again  Her days of manipulating me are over Just a word of wisdom to those of you out there  Narcissist dont change  My mom is doing the same thing to me at  that she was doing to me when I was   Dont waste your time or effort trying to change them because they will never change,941,187
26,p9gji9,0,1,My dad is extremely mad at me but I really need his financial support  A little backstory For my college living situation  my Ndad made me manage his house and has pressured me into finding roommates so they could pay him rent  He wasnt satisfied with how fast I found roommates so he ended up finding them all for me  moving in whoever he could  Hes currently in the process of evicting my roommate because he hasnt been paying rent  He is also suing him for the rent  I traveled for a month this summer without giving my dad any notice because when I brought up the idea to him he got super mad and said I wasnt allowed to go  Im    When I got back home  my dad blamed me for my roommate still living in the house  He said since I wasnt there to  establish my presence  and let in a sheriff to officially evict him  it is entirely my fault  My dad refuses to communicate with my roommate until he pays rent  Im supposed to be the messenger between them but since my dad is  well  an Ndad he never has anything formative to say to him  Im kinda lost on what to do  Since Ive been gone  my roommate got hooked on hard drugs and is refusing to leave the house because he wants to get back at my dad for suing him  He doesnt clean up after himself  sleeps on the couch  tracks dirt everywhere  has a pitbull he doesnt take care of  etc  This has made my living situation total shit  Im talking to him and trying to communicate that we need him to leave  and it seems like he gets the message at first but he always ends up raging about my dad  Because of this  I have no idea if he plans to leave or not  When I tell my dad what he says  he rages at me about how its all my fault that hes still living there  I feel very unsafe with this roommate  He keeps a bat by the front door and I think he wants to hurt my dad  He lives in the living room and leaves messes everywhere so its just really unpleasant to walk around in my own home  theres a   chance that he will move out but in the meantime hes there and it sucks  Im considering moving out but I know my dad will get even more mad at me for abandoning the familys house and not pushing my roommate to leave on a daily basis  I am still in college and paying my car insurance  registration  class fees  wifi  utilities  vet bills  I dont feel prepared to move out on my own  Additionally if I do move out there is no way my dad would be willing to help me with college fees  since moving out would be  abandoning my family   Im lost on what to do  On one hand I feel unsafe  but on the other hand I will struggle so much if I move out  TLDR my dad is pressuring me to live with a roommate from hell  I want to move out but doing that risks going NC and Im scared that I dont have the finances to put myself thru college,2820,553
27,p9gjb2,0,1,I idolized my enabling father  now I feel betrayed My mom is a classic narc  My dad was my childhood hero  yet an enabler  Recently  a truly ridiculous story happened  my nmom instructed her employee to spy on me and my friend by reading our private conversation  I called this very employee a pedophile and everyone got offended by what I wrote in my private messages  The guy I called a pedo was engaged by then in a sexual relationship with a seventeen year old being thirty five himself and is addicted to ADBL  adult baby diaper lover  pornography  As you can see  I was entitled to have this sort of opinion and I never had any intention to speak up publicly on this topic My mother put me trough some usual narcissistic hell Im already kind of used to  stalking and threatening included  But its not what the post is about When I learned more about how narcissistic families work  I began to feel dissapointed by what father DIDNT do when I lived with them  He never stood up for me  He did nothing when my mother slapped me in the face  He did nothing when she gaslighted me  he did nothing when she called me a whore  he did nothing when she made massive argument over nothing and then treated me like I was invisible for weeks and refused to even talk to me And now he said  that it was his job as an employer to protect his employee that felt offended by what he read in a private convo he was not entitled to  My enabling father who never protected me from my mother  now protects a perverted psycho  who read my private conversation without permission  I feel betrayed  Its devastating to realize that after all these years my parents chose some creepy guy that validated my privacy over their daughter  I thought he was my hero  And I only thought that because he was nowhere near as abusive as my mother was  and I had no idea what it meant to have a normal family,1898,346

31,p9fzz3,0,1,An act of karma   My Nmother currently has a limp and possibly dislocated kneecap but she still hasnt called up the doctor to diagnose the issue  What should I do  Im unsure on how I can help  From what she keeps telling me about her knee injury  it seems that it could be a dislocated knee because she says shes fine when she sits  but it feels like it pops out slides out somewhere when she walks and stands up  All of this hits one of my future worries where my Nmother will become too old to perhaps take care of herself properly and not call the doctor for help because she forgets to or doesnt want to I thought these health issues for her would happen further down into the future   And I dont want to live with her until she passes away  Ill be willing to be low contact and see her once a week to check up on her when I finally move out for good  hopefully next year Back into the present though  I just feel like this was an act of karma on her  Because Im also going through a health issue with my gastrointestinal system at the moment  possibly just acid reflux or mild gastritis  And I saw my doctor for this  And on the drive home  my Nmother  as usual  tried to start an argument with me  this time being about my health issues and sadly  she successfully managed to start an argument with me and she just screamed and nagged me in the solo ride home with her in the car I was in pain and discomfort  but she was screaming at me and I had to do subtle breathing exercises to stay as calm as possible as stress would only make my condition worse  Point is  she did nothing to help Come a few days later now  she now has a possibly dislocated painful kneecap and has a limp and really exaggerates her limp around me She always exaggerates about my luck and my karma to me  but shes never reflected on her own I guess  because guess what  Shes still continuing to verbally abuse me  D shes digging herself into a hole and I told her to call the doctor but she still hasnt done it and is going to work for   hours anyway What am I supposed to do if she keeps forgetting or not wanting to be independent and help herself  I helped myself with my health issue  why cant she,2211,417

33,p9fhlv,0,1,Advice needed Hi everyone  I have recently decided I need to try a way to cut ties with my parents completely  Its like Im suddenly realizing and understanding how deeply messed up I was treated as a child and even now as an adult  Im only    I have current health issues and I spoke to my doctor about this and she said I can even tell my parents its doctors orders to take a break from them for at least  weeks  and that what I have isnt just PTSD from my childhood but it is just considered ongoing psychological abuse at this point   I just really need some advice on how to do so  My parents currently help me financially by letting me remain on their health insurance  this is a major one for me due to having health issues and I know paying for my own insurance would leave me with higher copays for medications in addition to paying for the insurance itself  and my job doesnt offer insurance plans with any decent mental health coverage   paying for my car insurance  the car is paid off   and I am still on their phone plan  I do live on my own and pay for my apartment and bills associated with it and just daily living expenses on my own  Ive debated trying to go low contact or very low contact  but I dont even know how to say that without my parents flipping their lids  Its mostly my mom  its just nonstop expecting I speak to her on the phone at least  times a day and when I dont I have to explain myself as to why we didnt talk  I get guilt tripped constantly with nonstop gaslighting  All my mom does is nonstop call me to rant and basically suck all emotional energy I have  and Ive been grey rocking her nonstop which just makes her say things to upset me and try to get me to interact and fly off the handle at her  which then turns around to me being the liar  being manipulative  putting words in her mouth she never said  etc    Ive been in therapy for about  to  years now  just in the interim looking for a new therapist currently   and I really dont think I am any of those things because I think a therapist would have pointed that out to me by now  Is it better for me to just endure dealing with them for now so I get some financial support  this makes me feel guilty  but I also kind of feel ok with it after dealing with a life of bullshit from my family   I really dont think Id mind just having contact once a week or so  When I lived with my parents growing up I really do feel that my mom told my dad things so he would fly off the handle towards me  since moving out and being on my own my father and I havent had a single issue  we talk maybe once a week or once every other week and its usually short  I still hold some anger towards him since he was verbally pretty mean growing up and things got physical a few times  and dont want to be close but I think he is fine with not being close anyway and he always tells me Im an adult I can do whatever I want at this point   My dad anyway is the one who provides any financial support  when I chose to go to college my mom attacked me for trying to get back at them by only applying to expensive schools to just further drain them but my dad told me that its up to me and hes the one paying anyway so to ignore her   Im sorry this is kind of everywhere  I just really dont know exactly what to do in this situation  I always end up letting my mom in again thinking things are different and better but then I am always let down in the end  but things just really feel different this time and Im really ready to limit end contact  Does anyone have any advice  Thank you,3590,702

35,p9f7kt,0,1,Is this considered verbal abuse  Ill just get to the point of this  My parents are the type of parents who says crying means youre weak  They can be sometimes judgemental too and ones who sometimes gossip behind your back  Back in  I was already dealing with being bullied and feeling isolated in school from my peers  At home I did so too  Being home use to be place where I felt comfortable being myself  I use to be kid who cared and say I love you mom and dad whenever I sleep and gave out hugs  Compared to now its not the same for me  I seriously hate it and thinking about some of these things makes me hate myself sometimes  When I felt depressed for first time in  from having tough time making friends and trying fit in within my peers  When I tried tell my parents about it  they wouldnt believe me that I was depressed  I honestly cried from that point when my parents denied me what I was feeling and going through  They called me weak  bitch  a sussie   youre nothing blah blah all because I cried and tried tell them I was depressed  I ran to my room and cried and cried so much  I felt sad and frustrated with myself in life  I honestly punched and slapped my face out of frustrations and felt so low in my life in th grade  For first time in my life I felt alone with no friends and no parents thats there to comfort you or at least talk things out  I stayed in my room for days  only came out to eat and go back to my room without a word  With me being bullied at school and not being able tell your parents without being called weak  Made me felt like I was at my breaking point of my life  I was truly at my lowest point of life  where I had thoughts hurting myself  What stopped me from harming myself was being afraid of hurting myself Even when its about things like Im older than you I know more than you  Whenever Im right about something or appeared to do my research or just know a lot about the subject  Theyll call me know it all or get mad about it  Theyll just put me down about it  Whenever I enjoy something or found something I liked  my parents would often make fun of me and say this is weak or this is stupid  why youre watching that etc  From there the last ounce of me being comfortable around my parents ended  It was like a switch turned off to me  I use to feel comfortable and open being with my parents  Now its like I feel out of touch with them  Where Im quiet and often feel uncomfortable talking things to them  Even the simplest things like shaving makes me feel uncomfortable to asked them about  Even when something happen to me  I always feel hesitate to talk to my parents about certain things  Which is why I mostly keep to myself  I always know whatever I tell my parents about something I want to be kept between me and them  theyll straight up be ready tell the whole family  The word just spreads crazy to everyone in the family  Its one of the reasons why I feel uncomfortable towards them  Example  I know this can be embarrassing to some people  I loved Professional Wrestling ever since I was a kid  I use to watch Raw or Smackdown every Monday and Friday night  Whenever my dad comes out to see it  hell make fun of me watching it  Would often make comments about it and laugh about it  If I tried to say something about it  hell get mad about it  Automatically say Im talking back when I was just trying explain myself  From there my dad ruined my love for professional wrestling  which was something at least I looked forward to watch every week in my life  Even on my birthdays they always find a way to ruin it for me  My last birthday my dad often picked on me for smallest things and yelled at me on my birthday  Overall I look back at myself feeling lost in this world due to me feeling isolated from my family  and my peers  I feel so empty and drained  Where Im use to this feeling of emptiness  like I cant say I love you anymore  I often have aneixty attack and depression on my shoulders  I cant really word everything that happened within past few years  I dont understand why I cant but this is all I can say about it  The last person I ever felt comfortable going to was my grandmother  She was always there for me whenever I needed her when I was little  In the future I do plan on seeing therapist when ever I can  This is just glimpse of what I felt and experienced but Is this considered verbal abuse or somewhat,4447,849

37,p9f0yv,0,1,Parents keep breaking promises  So a week ago I was supposed to return to college on Tuesday and help my girlfriend move in to our new apartment but my parents told me that it was too late    hours to get there    hrs total for my parents to go back and forth   and told me to reschedule  Luckily for me  my girlfriend was able to move in by herself  and although I felt really sorry  shamefully I said “ok  fine  I can reschedule” to my parents  even though they promised me that they will definitely drive me back on that day  When I chose last Saturday to go back  they started making excuses like  “oh  we need you to take care of chores because stepdad is busy  mind you  my mother has too many pets and my young brother that need a lot of care ” or “oh  we need you to take the animals to the vet on Sunday”  now that my gf was able to move out by herself  When I suggested I could use  paid by myself  public transportation  they flipped out and told me if I can’t even wait “a bit” just to go to campus  I’m so ungrateful and I’m not welcome in their house  Uh wtf  So I ended up not being able to go back last Saturday  and because the only apparent available day they had was this Saturday  yesterday   they told me they DEFINITELY can get me on campus by that time  Deja vu  because my parents came home too late  due to “stocking up pet supplies” that they didn’t even need yesterday and had today  Sunday  to get  and because it was too late to drive me and go back atp  without the restocking  I could have left home at pm  but my parents returned at pm  which is too late   They did try to attempt in telling me they could drive me yesterday night  and when I agreed that if they can drive me yesterday night then I would like them to  my school starts literally tomorrow  but they made snide comments like how I was a ungrateful girl who can’t think for how tired they would get driving me so late  how I will be basically disowned if I chose yesterday night  even how I’d never get a boyfriend with this kind of attitude  I’m not even straight…   etc I ended up just not wanting to argue anymore because the situation made me physically sick and dizzy  probably because of how much I was angry  even though I should be grateful to them to take time out to drive me back to college because I don’t have a car   I’m waiting today  but at this point I don’t even know   if I’m gonna get back to college lol,2436,469

44,p9ehqg,0,1,Hit me because Im such an awful mum   Today I had yet another argument with my mum over something that is so insignificant  It also made me realize that my mum has narcissistic tendency  Note  Im raised in an Asian family so sometimes Im confused whether it is a mental illness or the culture thing  As a teen  I was sent to a boarding school in another state to fulfill my grandpas wish as he always wanted one of his grandchildren to be in the same state as him  When I graduated and moved back to the city  my friends soon ignored me and any attempts to be friendly with them ends up with cold shoulders  It stressed me out and the fact that I lost contact with my friends from my hometown just made me feel even more isolated  Not to mention my whole college years is online  So  the only person I could look up to for comfort and love is my mum  I told her how lonely I am and how I feel demotivated  Of course  since the problem never solved I kept telling her the same stories everytime I wanted to vent  which I try to keep on a minimum as to not frustrate her   This time  I was telling her how my bestfriends did not show up for game nights  made me wait for hours only to apologize the next morning  This has been going on for multiple times that I decided to let it out  We were in the kitchen trying to make dinner Me      And yeah sometimes I regret going to school at  state  because I have no friends here  The friends from  state  avoid me  Mum   You talk like your friends from  state  are evil and mean  Me   No  I did not  Mum   You just did by telling that statement  Me   Please stop putting words in my mouth  Mum   Look  you keep venting about the same things on and on and its going to make you mentally ill    Things went downhill from there  I tried to tell her that I just wanted to think about what she just said in silence  but she kept on ranting how I have a pessimistic view in life and that I might have issues  Its ironic since last week  I tried convincing my mum to send me to therapy but she said that Im just fine  Suddenly I am not  During the whole argument  she refused to listen to my points and continued talking until one point I raised my voice to tell her that I respect her as a mother  but she needs to consider my feelings  Oh  I was wrong for doing that This made her even more aggravated because she runs to me  grabs my arms and started to make me hit her while  screaming   IM AN AWFUL MOTHER  HIT ME  HIT ME BECAUSE IM A BAD PARENT   then she sat on the floor while mumbling   Maybe Im just about to have my menopause    She whispers some prayers to herself before washing her face and leaves the house  My younger siblings tried to search for her but then I stopped because she always does this whenever she had a fight  The fucked up part is  no matter who was right or wrong my mum will always paint me as that one sick  rebellious child to my younger siblings  I dont know what exactly she told them but whenever there is a disagreement  my siblings would think Im the bad one,3075,579

46,p9ea7x,0,1,Outsmarting a narcissistic parent  Share your stories  We all know how it can seem almost impossible to beat a narcissistic parent at their own games  Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent  I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom  Feel free to share yours   I wrote about the following in a reply to someone elses post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent I grew up in the s and s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes  Even when I was elementary school aged  I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes  I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking  When I entered my teen years  I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore  She eventually stopped asking However  one day  I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends  My parents had no objection  Later in the day  my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends  I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore  I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing Anyway  her sweet demeanor suddenly changed  and through her clenched jaw  she informed me   Fine  Then you will NOT be using the car this evening   However  her threat didnt sway me  and I told her fine  I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said   Sorry  we cant go to the movie  My mom wont let me use the car because I wont go buy her cigarettes  Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend  her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment  The narcissist in my mom couldnt stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car  Her demeanor once again suddenly changed  and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line  she exclaimed with fake laughter   Oh wait  wait  Hold on  You know I was only kidding  Ha ha ha  So not only did I get to use the car after all  I semi shamed my mom  and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again   I have been living in Japan for about  years  I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family  Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me As you can imagine  it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year  plus spending money while Im there  etc  Despite this  I have never played the  poor card  and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket  My mom  on the other hand  has offered a number of times to either  chip in  or  go half  on the cost of a ticket  A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket  However  I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached  In fact  out of all these offers and in all my time living here  I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight About eight or nine years ago  the last time I ever accepted her offer   she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas  I initially refused and told her it wasnt necessary  However  she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent  She was going on about how she knows its a lot of money to come home twice a year  how she does things to help my sisters  but  because I live in Japan  she and my dad cant help me as much as they would like  etc I finally relented  but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad  which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do  before she went offering to buy an almost   dollar plane ticket for me  She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours When I phoned back  my moms caring and supportive attitude had completely changed  She was now using her half annoyed half righteous tone with me  the one where she elongates the last word in every clause sentence   So I talked to your faaatherrr  and he and I have deciiideeddd    She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden  She told me that she and my dad would  help me out  this time by paying for my ticket  but  its about time you considered moving back to Canada because we cant afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan  I thought to myself   Okay  here we go again   But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered  but if it were too much trouble  it wasnt necessary  and not to worry about   No  No  Thats fiiiine  Well buy your ticket this tiiiime  But you need to think about moving baaack   Of course  I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket  I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my moms attitude and he had no say in  their  decision that I should move back to Canada I got off the phone and though  F    it  Im not going back for Christmas   and I meant it  I waited until the next day  and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story  I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible  I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket  but it really wasnt necessary  It was so nice of him to support my moms offer to pay for my ticket  but I really didnt expect them to buy it  I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer  but it was too generous and I wouldnt be able to accept it  In fact  Ive decided to stay in Japan over the holidays Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad  my phone started ringing  Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return  I had apparently  misunderstood  what she had said  she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket  and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas  All I needed to do was book my ticket  let her know how much it would cost  and she would put the money on my credit card   When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a  bad back   in reality  she couldnt stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work   she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care   after school care because it was a waste of money  Appreciative of my moms offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month  my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer  Big mistake To give my mom credit  she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part  but even that has its limits when shes feeling like holding one of her pity parties  It doesnt help that my niece  since she was a small child and even now at  years old  is prone to outbursts  breakdowns  and temper tantrums  As my niece got a little bit older  my moms over reactions to my nieces over reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over react to the slightest misbehaviour When she was seven years old  my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school  and not to be outdone  my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself  She phoned my sister to work in hysterics  not the first time  literally bawling about my sisters  out of control  disrespectful  hateful  horrible child   you get the picture   And my mom sobbed on and on about how  I just cant take it anymore  Its just too much  Ive had enough  YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter  My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background  who knows where my dad had escaped to   My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone After getting off the phone  my sister realized that saving money on day care   after school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse  So before she went to pick up her kids  my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after school care for my niece and nephew When my sister arrived at my parents  my mom came running to the door in hysterics  her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind  ranting about my sisters ungrateful daughter   You need to do something about YOUR children  my nephew was now apparently caught up in this   WAAAA    As my sister is trying to get her kids coats and boots on  she told my mom to calm down and that  having a temper tantrum over your seven year old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isnt going to solve anything   My mom for the umpteenth time   YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter  I cant take it   WAAAA    At which point my sister told my mom to  grow up  and that she didnt need to  take it anymore  because from the next day  the kids would both be in after school care and walked out the door  At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming   No    No    Why     nieces name     No    Why     as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away My sister didnt go no contact with my mom after that  but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again  my sister refused and kept them in after school care Any stories from any of you about poetic retribution,10086,1898

51,p9dyba,0,1,My mother isn’t allowing me to see my younger brother I’ve been no contact with my mother about two years now  It has been a roller coaster ride of emotions but mentally I have improved so much since I stopped interacting with her I am   My little brother is my half brother who still lives at home with my mother and step dad  He is   The last time I saw him was last year during a small wedding ceremony of one of my other brothers  He spent the whole reception with my husband and I discussing video games he was playing  We ended up buying him a video game that we thought he would like for his switch  He loved it Since that interaction my husband and I have been discussing how we would love to do things with him again  Before we went no contact with my mother we had started taking him out and doing stuff with him  We took him to a really cool old arcade and out to pizza  He had a blast and I heard after that outing his new favorite restaurant because the restaurant we took him too About a month ago my husband texted my mother to see if it would be possible to take my brother somewhere  We outlined that we are adults and would never talk bad about her or her husband to my brother  We just wanted to have a relationship with my brother and would love to work something out with them  A week passes and we don’t get a response  My husband reaches out again and same thing   No response We get another one of my brothers to ask her if she is receiving our messages  She said she was  He asked her if she was ever going to respond and she says no  This infuriates me and my husband  I had discussed with my therapist that if I didn’t get a response from my mother that I would start making care packages and give them to my brother to give to my youngest brother  We ended up picking out a card  candy  and a Nintendo gift card so he could get himself a game  While filling out the card I say fuck it  let’s go over  I want to give it to him myself You guys understand how hard that was for me  I haven’t seen that woman in two years  besides my brothers wedding   I was just so pissed that she was doing this   We get there and give him everything  My step dad calls us in the back yard  He acts normal  He tries to chit chat and be pleasant which I appreciated  My mom doesn’t say a word  Both my husband and I could tell she was irked  I mainly talk to my brother about how he’s been and what things he is in to now  Mainly video games and books   He’s such a smart and cute kid  Seeing him really made my week We didn’t stay long   only about   minutes  In that time my mother said not a word to me  A few days later I talked to my grandma and she lets slip that she had talked to my mom and she mentioned our visit  Apparently my brother was down before we got there but seeing us made him happy The next day my husband again reaches out to my mom to say I’m glad that my brother was happy after our visit and we would love to work something out with them to do something with him  She doesn’t respond  The following day   I break down and text her  I am polite  No response It infuriates me that she’s using my brother as a pawn to get to me  He is an innocent kid  All I know is that I am going to stop reaching out to her  I can’t do this anymore  It is upsetting me too much  I will write my brother letters and post cards and give him packages through my brother  I am going to document every thing I do in the hopes that when he gets older I can show him that I never stopped loving him or carrying about him  I just don’t want him to feel alone or abandoned like I did  I am so pissed off at my mother   More pissed off then anything she has ever did to me and she has done some mighty cruel things,3747,740

57,p9dk8e,0,1,Parents are Narcissists  ruining my relationship My parents have caused a lot of issues in my relationship   Since my relationship with my girlfriend even started   I came out to my parents  🏳️‍🌈  I introduced my girlfriend to my family as my friend in the beginning because I was still in the closet   My girlfriend starting coming over for only a couple months in  then My parents told me that she can no longer stay the night   Which I thought was strange considering the fact we still went places and talked still  We don’t have a huge gap in our age   I am  now and my girlfriend is    I did move out the end of  and spent a lot of time with my girlfriend and her side of the family   not  Necessarily with my family because me and my girlfriend was always together   So if I would come over to my side of the family she wouldn’t be able to come inside so she would be in the car   This went on for the first half of our relationship   They would not speak to her at all which they did before  when I came out to my parents I didn’t get the greatest response   My mom said “  I have opened myself up to the devil  amp  sent me multiple bible scriptures   My Father said he figured it out and he hates my decision and that he is not proud of my decision   He said he doesn’t want my girlfriend around my sisters because he doesn’t want them seeing me with a girl is okay   Right then and there I should have said okay then I won’t come around because we are together   It doesn’t stop there   There a was a situation  months later where my mother feels as if my girlfriend disrespected her because my mother wasn’t listening to me  which has always been the issue even before my girlfriend came into the picture  so my gf basically said how she doesn’t listen to me and don’t get treated the same   My mom was so stuck on how does she know about the favoritism and shit  so of course I confided in my gf  On my graduation I almost didn’t get to walk because my mom was getting her nails done and time was cutting close  it was like she didn’t take it serious   When it came to my younger sister competition or practices being late is out of the question   So I have express this to my girlfriend   So she knew how I felt about my parents not listening to me and not receiving the same treatment as my siblings   She called my girlfriend a manipulator a devil multiple times  My mom called my dad and showed up not listening to anything I had to say he man handled me and threw me in the car and drove off   because Ihave never seen my parents completely out of character and took me away from my girlfriend   I was freaking out trying to explain to my dad what happened   He completely shut me down from trying to explain to him what happened and said he will take me back to the hospital if I continued    that day I was released from the hospital from  trying to commit Suicide the main reason was them not accepting me and they were FULLY AWARE of tha   he drove me to my grandma house and she made me read bible scriptures basically trying to push me to believe being gay isn’t right   They took my phone and car   car is in my name    because they felt like  “they were trying to protect me “  Still to this day they feel like they were just trying to protect me  because I was weak and not in  my right mind   I didn’t talk to my parents for a whole year   And in that one year all my parents could do was make assumptions of why I wasn’t talking to them  In there minds they think “ my girlfriend was keeping me from them “ in reality it was them who caused this to happen   When I wasn’t talking to them my dad came to my home and wrote his name on a piece of paper and put it in the driver seat   He still has my back up key to my car   He didn’t knock on my door nor tell me he was coming   He disconnected my phone because I wasn’t talking to him   I believe he forgot that he told me something otherwise   They try to justify there behavior all the freakin time   It’s like they constantly blame my girlfriend for everything and try to view my girlfriend as this negative person because to them “ she disrespected my mom” which she didn’t   I am mentally tired of there assumptions and how much they have caused in my relationship  My girlfriend feels like she is reason that my relationship with my parents is the way that it is now is her fault and I tried explaining to her no it’s them   I don’t know how to get her to understand that they caused this by what they did and what they say   Still to this day my dad keeps saying he rather me be with a male   Ask strange questions like does my girlfriend have anger issues   And asking me if I am eating   Like mentally I feel like I can’t deal  Me and girlfriend did come to conclusion that they were reading our messages because I already know my parents track me because they have in the past … I am trying to figure out what boundaries I need to set to get pass this,4956,1005
58,p9dizm,0,1,Does anyone else wish it was worse so you could justify your negative feelings   LONG  Hi everyone  I just discovered this sub and after reading so many similar experiences I feel really understood  Thanks for setting this up  heres my piece My parents were never physically abusive  and they have a tendency to love bomb after doing something wrong  which makes me question what my own instincts tell me about their behavior  For example  they basically made me visit them over the summer and a few months ago they came downstairs at midnight while I was playing video games and proceeded to scream at me until am  wouldnt take any self defense which they framed as me being selfish and disliking it when I was called out  wore me out until I simply just told them what they wanted to hear to make them stop  and the next day gave me a blank check to go out to dinner and a bar with some old high school friends  all fully vaccinated and masked  Meanwhile  they wont give me the simplest of apologies  The same trip home I jokingly told my mother about a time a few years ago when I put off watching Good Omens for months because she said in one text that she wanted to see it  only for her to get bored of it in  episode  Which felt kind of shit at the time since I was looking forward to it and wanted to show her the adaptation of my favourite book  but isnt an abusive action by any means  When I brought it up though  she heavily implied that I was making up false memories  She couldnt even apologize over a tv show  but will scream at me until am and expects me to apologize for things that arent even wrong  but she thinks they are because I dont perfectly conform to exactly what she wants me to do about things involving my own damn life Still  theyve never laid a finger on me  I come from a pretty comfortable upper middle class background since my grandfather was big in the oil industry during a lot of lucky boom years so I never hurt for material things  I always had a big  warm roof over my head and nice new family cars  I always had food  heating  clean water  a safe neighbourhood to bike around in  new clothes  and those REALLY expensive shoes and winter coats that last for years  I got the latest game consoles for birthdays and went on twice yearly vacations to places like Sri Lanka and New York City  I went to a private high school and they let me move to the other side of the world for a pricey university  I was able to come and go as I pleased growing up with the freedom of transit passes and a pretty lax curfew  I had a lot of great things and opportunities basically handed to me that a lot of  if not most  kids dont get  so in a lot of ways  I feel like Im a spoiled  ungrateful  toxic piece of shit for feeling the way I do about my parents actions  Because I got all these great things by luck of birth lottery  but I still struggle to return an  I love you   They never restricted my movement  but they would snoop through my journals and somehow get through my laptop password when I was away  If they found anything they didnt like  it was justified  and sometimes they would act like a family emergency happened just so I would get home quicker  thinking someone was dead  only to get cornered and yelled at for hours because they invaded my privacy  To this day  they say it was justified  We would go on long expensive vacations to new countries to explore the world  but if I expressed any distress about how they treated me  they would bring those up and call me an ungrateful asshole because to them  throwing enough money at your kid negates anything wrong you might have done  I remember a dinner one night when I was  where  after they had gone through my phone without permission and read all my texts to my friends where I had expressed how I didnt feel supported by their extremely negative reaction to my coming out to them  they said  Sure  we send you and your friends to comic con last week with  bucks and a ticket to meet William Shatner  but I guess we dont support you   To this day  they deny how they reacted when I told them I was trans Now  their tune on that has changed a bit because they know they cant stop me anymore  but they still act as though I need to defer to them how my own transition works  They act like Im evil and vindictive for being out and open before I told them again at the age of   Like I need to put my own life and happiness on hold and continue living a horrible lie because they werent personally comfortable with it yet I feel like they think that  just because they gave me more than enough material things and never hit me  that was enough  As if material objects and enough money thrown at someone was a substitute for genuine connection  And now  I just cant forgive them for how they treated me in the past  but they wont even acknowledge it ever happened  and if they do  they pull the  youre the real bad guy because this hurts my feelings   I got a lot of hugs and I love yous  but they felt empty when they were contrasted against their actions towards me I find myself genuinely wishing sometimes that they were physically abusive  just so I could feel like my feelings are justified  As if this would only be valid if I was beaten and scarred by them  because its hard to believe the kid who had everything would rather be anywhere else  especially when all the stories you hear about narc abuse come from kids with less fortunate backgrounds  But the truth is  I would rather have a loving and understanding and poor family than what I got Does anyone else get this  Like your feelings arent justified and youre just a piece of shit because so many other people wouldve killed to have some of the things you did,5776,1070
59,p9di1e,0,1,Need your opinion on this because Ive been gaslight too many times   In laws being s xually inappropriate  Possible h rrassment  I come from a very s  x phobic family so Im not even sure whats appropriate and whats not anymore Please give me your opinion about this My in laws have no problems talking about s  x  My fathert in law  the narcissist  is a  something year old man who was clearly never s  xually satisfied in his life  His wife  the enabler  calls herself a feminist but has no problem having him constantly looking at young girls in the street or objectifying women in general They have been talking a lot about s  xual topics  and Im ok with that as long as its kept not personal and maybe as a joking topic of conversation  The problem is  that I think they took it too far  The other day my mother in law was talking about how she suddently developped inverted n  pples and was fearing that she had breast cancer  but she got it checked and turned out shes fine  but doesnt like how her breasts look now  Weird thing to say at a dinner table if you ask me  but ok  I told her that some people are born that way and it doesnt mean her breasts are ugly or anything  And then she said that she also hates them because she likes to have them s  cked and now things were going to be harder in bed  This was in front of me  in front of her son  her husband and her  year old mother In another occasion  she described to us the shape of her lab  a Her husband is even worse At some point we were all laughing and having fun  and he asked me if I  enjoyed s  x on the table   This had something to do with the topic of conversation that we were having  which I forgot tbh  but still    quite inappropriate Id say    I took it as a joke and just laughed it off  but was actually shocked and confused  This was in front of his wife  who just sat there and said nothing The other day  as he was walking behind me  he said that he could see my underpants  I was wearing a short skirt and thought that he was being  kind   like when you tell people  theres spinach in your teeth  and I just told him ok He then added  I should have told you that I could see that you werent wearing panties  so you would have raised your skirt to check if it was true that you forgot to wear them   I was shocked  But of course  since Im just now learning about boundaries  learning to stop people pleasing etc  I just laughed it off     Like Ive done multiple times   I have confronted my partner about his parents being sexually off in general  and he normalizes this behaviour so much  He said that its normal for parents to talk about sex in front of their adult child and that it shouldnt be a taboo  He agreed to me that his father was inappropriate when he told me those two things I wrote about  but other things  like his mother describing her l  bia  are normal for him because its just  describing the human body   Also  he seems to have normalized these behaviours so much that as theyre happening  they just fly under the radar for him  and I am the one who brings them up afterwards Im ok with s  xual topics  but not when they become personal like this  i e  talking about your s  x life in front of your son and his partner   But still  Im so ignorant about these things that I dont know where to draw the line    or how Can you please give me your input on what is normal and what is not   What is considered normal behaviour around s  xual topics between parents and their adult children and whats messed up  Im afraid to be too judgmental  puritan because I was raised in a house where we never discussed these things,3683,671

70,p9bvs6,0,1,How do you all explain your relationship with your nparent s  to your significant other  This may be a question which has already been asked here in the past  My boyfriend and I have been together for  years  By now  he knows a lot of details about my Ndad and what a difficult relationship I have with him  but there are still some moments where my bf doesn’t seem to quite understand the relationship or my thoughts actions surrounding my behavior with my Ndad  and the problem for me is  as I know a lot of us have experienced  that I sometimes don’t really understand my own emotions around it so idk how to explain it to my bf  For example  it’s been very difficult for my bf to understand why I am still in contact with my Ndad  The reality for me right now is that I feel like it’s just easier this way for many reasons  Thankfully  I live in another state from my Ndad  so I’ve been able to gain a lot more control of my own life and keep some distance from him  and I also know that if I attempt going NC  my Ndad would find a way to make my life miserable again  Maybe one day I will find a way to cut off all communication  but as it currently stands  I would essentially have to disappear and restart my life all over again if I wanted to go NC  I’ve told this to my bf  which he still doesn’t seem to fully understand  but has at least accepted as an answer for now  However  there are still moments where I will make certain comments that seem to confuse him  which I understand because I have a lot of conflicting emotions surrounding my Ndad as well  and I don’t really know how to explain them to someone who isn’t in this situation  As we all know  one of the hallmark traits of narcissists is making themselves the victim of every situation and throwing the blame around for their actions to other people  most often the real victim themselves  in our case  the victims being their children   So that creates a lot of confusing feelings for us growing up because we end up feeling guilty and responsible for situations that we didn’t cause  And narcissists know how to make you feel sorry for them as well too  so we grow up simultaneously feeling like we have the blame for things that are out of our control but also resenting the people who make us feel guilty  Like a constant battle between feeling like the perpetrator and the victim at the same time  The other day  I made a comment to my bf about feeling sorry for my Ndad about a current situation he is having surrounding his house  which could cost him a lot of money and stress  My boyfriend responded by saying “did you just hear what you said ” As if he was shocked by me saying I feel sorry for my Ndad  I also recently had to spend a few days with my Ndad on a trip that he was insisting we take for the last two years  My bf kept asking me why I was being nice to my father  and it was difficult for him to understand when I said that it was just easier this way  It was easier to just be nice to my father in certain moments  even if it made me uncomfortable  I was just in the mindset of trying to get through the trip as quickly and conflict free as possible and I knew that my Ndad would throw a tantrum if things didn’t happen the way he wanted them to happen and them every situation would turn into a whole big thing  I guess I’ve been rambling a bit and over explaining things that we all already know and experience  but this is also me venting a little bit  Ultimately  of course I know that my father is a toxic person and I may benefit from cutting him out completely  but I just feel like right now cutting him out would end up causing me more stress than anything  But I can understand  how my bf would be confused about the situation when I vent to him about my Ndad but then also say that I feel sorry for him with his current house situation  Which honestly confuses me too  but it’s something that been so ingrained into my psyche since I was a kid that I don’t know how to turn it off  And that’s what narcissists specialized in  manipulating their victims to feel whatever way they want them to feel  Despite all this   my boyfriend is still very supportive of me and has helped me a lot  but I guess I was just wondering if others had experienced this same situation with your partners and how you have managed to communicate with them so that they would understand  Anyway  thanks for reading all of this and for any advise you may be able to provide  ❤️,4479,854
71,p9br0c,0,1,How to get Ndad to stop being angry  So  it all happened two days ago  I was going through a bit of a down mood  and mum happened to see it  she told my Ndad and he was adamant that I go to the room he was in and talk about it I said no  and at first he was like  come on whats the worst that could happen  I was insistent that I didnt want to talk about it because it was a personal issue and he started to get really angry at me Saying he just wanted to get rid of my anxiety I went to my room and Ndad came up  saying that I had left him in a state of worry because he didnt know if I was going to be a threat or not Also going on about how I did it on purpose to wind him up and that I wanted to control the house or something He also said I was trying to wind him up on purpose I told him that I was not going to talk to him about it and hes immediately like  if you are going to be a threat to me and try to control the house you can get out of the house  So then we arranged that I would leave once I found an appropriate accommodation But that wasnt enough  he started saying I had to leave immediately  this instant  because my presence in the house was angering him It was the middle of the night and I had no temporary accommodation at this point He tries to grab me to throw me out of the house and I call the police  which makes him finally leave me alone The next day  he says he wants to talk to me for five minutes  I say yes  hoping to get somewhere but his little conversation is just trying to get me to believe Im an anxious wreck that has a phobia of him and I cant function on my own  so I need him to tell me whats what He goes on this weird rant about scientific facts and evidence and teeth and this anecdote about one of his friends that got all his teeth removed and got dentures instead as some kind of lesson  I have no idea what he was trying to say to be honest I state that conversation is pointless and leave the room  since I know it would have gone on for hours And to be honest  Id rather be shouted at him all day than lectured by him  at least when hes shouting I can actually do things and dont just have to sit and listen to him for  hours And because its frustrating that hes trying to manipulate my thoughts about myself  to get me to beileve his twisted narritive His justification this time is  that Im being rude and disrespectful   But he doesnt invade my personal space a or keep me up all night this time because I start to audio record him and block the entrance to my room whenever he tries He does however  tell me that if I contact the police again  that theyll arrest me for wasting police time I contacted the police after this and they did tell me to indeed call the emergency number if I needed them Its the third day now  no doubt hes gonna keep going at it Frankly this is causing mum and Ndad so much stress  I say that and theyre like  youre causing it  its your responsibility to calm us down  Unfortunately  my mum just goes along with everything my Ndad says  because hes been conditioning her for years with his delusional stories of how the world is out to get them So whenever he gets angry  she gets angry at whatever he is angry at too  because theyre a team I guess They even forced my sister to say nasty things to me  and she did because she was scared not to and now dad is using the evidence that my sister hates me to as further proof that I need sorting out I think Im gonna go out to the park for a majority of the day  I dont care if he smashes up my belongings tbh I frankly dont think theres any way to calm him down and not be in a situation that is triggering to me Because I dont like to have my time wasted But I guess thats the only way to make dad think he has control over me What would you suggest Tldr  Ndad has been angry at me for two days straight because I wont buy into his bs  and its starting to affect my ability to do normal everyday things,4015,774
72,p9boxb,0,1,Small Victories  Outsmarting a Narcissistic Parent We all know how it can seem almost impossible to beat a narcissistic parent at their own games  Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent  I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom  Feel free to share yours   I wrote about the following in a reply to someone elses post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent I grew up in the s and s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes  Even when I was elementary school aged  I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes  I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking  When I entered my teen years  I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore  She eventually stopped asking However  one day  I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends  My parents had no objection  Later in the day  my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends  I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore  I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing Anyway  her sweet demeanor suddenly changed  and through her clenched jaw  she informed me   Fine  Then you will NOT be using the car this evening   However  her threat didnt sway me  and I told her fine  I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said   Sorry  we cant go to the movie  My mom wont let me use the car because I wont go buy her cigarettes  Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend  her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment  The narcissist in my mom couldnt stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car  Her demeanor once again suddenly changed  and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line  she exclaimed with fake laughter   Oh wait  wait  Hold on  You know I was only kidding  Ha ha ha  So not only did I get to use the car after all  I semi shamed my mom  and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again   I have been living in Japan for about  years  I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family  Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me As you can imagine  it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year  plus spending money while Im there  etc  Despite this  I have never played the  poor card  and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket  My mom  on the other hand  has offered a number of times to either  chip in  or  go half  on the cost of a ticket  A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket  However  I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached  In fact  out of all these offers and in all my time living here  I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight About eight or nine years ago  the last time I ever accepted her offer   she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas  I initially refused and told her it wasnt necessary  However  she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent  She was going on about how she knows its a lot of money to come home twice a year  how she does things to help my sisters  but  because I live in Japan  she and my dad cant help me as much as they would like  etc I finally relented  but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad  which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do  before she went offering to buy an almost   dollar plane ticket for me  She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours When I phoned back  my moms caring and supportive attitude had completely changed  She was now using her half annoyed half righteous tone with me  the one where she elongates the last word in every clause sentence   So I talked to your faaatherrr  and he and I have deciiideeddd    She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden  She told me that she and my dad would  help me out  this time by paying for my ticket  but  its about time you considered moving back to Canada because we cant afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan  I thought to myself   Okay  here we go again   But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered  but if it were too much trouble  it wasnt necessary  and not to worry about   No  No  Thats fiiiine  Well buy your ticket this tiiiime  But you need to think about moving baaack   Of course  I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket  I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my moms attitude and he had no say in  their  decision that I should move back to Canada I got off the phone and though  F    it  Im not going back for Christmas   and I meant it  I waited until the next day  and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story  I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible  I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket  but it really wasnt necessary  It was so nice of him to support my moms offer to pay for my ticket  but I really didnt expect them to buy it  I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer  but it was too generous and I wouldnt be able to accept it  In fact  Ive decided to stay in Japan over the holidays Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad  my phone started ringing  Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return  I had apparently  misunderstood  what she had said  she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket  and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas  All I needed to do was book my ticket  let her know how much it would cost  and she would put the money on my credit card   When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a  bad back   in reality  she couldnt stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work   she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care   after school care because it was a waste of money  Appreciative of my moms offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month  my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer  Big mistake To give my mom credit  she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part  but even that has its limits when shes feeling like holding one of her pity parties  It doesnt help that my niece  since she was a small child and even now at  years old  is prone to outbursts  breakdowns  and temper tantrums  As my niece got a little bit older  my moms over reactions to my nieces over reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over react to the slightest misbehaviour When she was seven years old  my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school  and not to be outdone  my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself  She phoned my sister to work in hysterics  not the first time  literally bawling about my sisters  out of control  disrespectful  hateful  horrible child   you get the picture   And my mom sobbed on and on about how  I just cant take it anymore  Its just too much  Ive had enough  YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter  My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background  who knows where my dad had escaped to   My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone After getting off the phone  my sister realized that saving money on day care   after school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse  So before she went to pick up her kids  my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after school care for my niece and nephew When my sister arrived at my parents  my mom came running to the door in hysterics  her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind  ranting about my sisters ungrateful daughter   You need to do something about YOUR children  my nephew was now apparently caught up in this   WAAAA    As my sister is trying to get her kids coats and boots on  she told my mom to calm down and that  having a temper tantrum over your seven year old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isnt going to solve anything   My mom for the umpteenth time   YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter  I cant take it   WAAAA    At which point my sister told my mom to  grow up  and that she didnt need to  take it anymore  because from the next day  the kids would both be in after school care and walked out the door  At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming   No    No    Why     nieces name     No    Why     as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away My sister didnt go no contact with my mom after that  but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again  my sister refused and kept them in after school care Any stories from any of you about poetic retribution,10082,1897
73,p9bm8u,0,1,Father playing the victim by saying his daughters are racist towards him So I think I just need to rant for a bit I   f  moved out of my parents house about  years ago and went no contact with them    My father is a very racist person which was always really confusing for me because my parents both immigrated in the country that we are now living in  But he didnt see the irony in it  He says a lot of to put it mildly offensive crap about black and brown people  He especially hates refugees  which is even less understandable since he was a refugee himself   but I guess when they are not white it means for him that they do not deserve to come to this country  My father knew even back when I was living back home that I did not share his  opinions   I rarely spoke up to him in general because he was extremely terrifying to me back then  always screaming and beeing very aggressive  But in that regard I really couldnt take it  The disgusting things he said still haunt me to this day  like for example our chancellor deserves to be r  ped by refugees because she  let  them into this country     So when I finally spoke up to him  he just smiled and said that he wasnt beeing serious   Why would you ever say such a think in general      When I finished school I immediately moved out  I had planned this for a long time since it was an extremely toxic environment in this house and I was in seriosly bad mental state  My mom  my sister   f who moved out when she was   and I never said more than two or three words while my dad just kept rambling his disgusting shit over and over again  He felt entitled to our time  Never asked my sister or me about our interests or even our opinion about anything  Whenever we were talking to each other louder than whispering he would scream what was going on and that he would have to deal with something now  My sister moved out and my mental state started getting worse  I would never go out of my room  I cried a lot and whenever he felt like talking to me I just didnt say anything and waited until his rambling was over  After a year or so  my parents realised that something was wrong with me  My mother tried to talk to me but I was still silent  My father screamed at me that I would hate them and that somebody was influencing me to hate my parents  he thought it was liberal green propaganda   I still wasnt answering  He talked to my sister  who knew how I felt  but when she just denied to answer him  she yelled that she would be at fault if I would kill myself  I knew I need to get out  So that was the first thing I did when I finished school  I have been working for two years back then so I had a little money  So I moved out and immediately got no contact  My father was furious for a while  texting me  calling me and threatening me  He said I was a bad and ungrateful daughter and so on  I just didnt reply  I got therapy  a new appartment and a fantastic boyfriend so I feel fine now  He stopped harrassing me and I am really happy about that  My sister is still in contact with them both but feels very similar towards them  Recently she decided that she needed some boundaries  She talked to my mother and accidently started a shit storm  My mother threatened her with the police  I really dont know what the police could do about this situation  and my father basically kicked her out of the family while saying that she is morally abhorrent  This really effected her badly and she wasnt sure what to do  I only recommended her to ignore it and wait because he will just get over the situation after a while So the last text he send to her was so funny to me and really inspired me to post here  He said that he is sad that the propaganda influenced her that much that she is now hating her immigrant parents  He said that she can never become  one of them  no matter how badly she tries  So basically calling her a racist towards her own parents  I am just buffled by the irony of that  He probably thinks that because racism influences every of his decision that other people are like that too and never in his life thinks about that this has nothing to do with his nationality but with him simply beeing a bad person,4218,810
74,p9bet0,0,1,My mom is hilarious and I love her dearly  but she’s a compulsive joker  My mom and I are very close  especially because we both survived my emotionally abusive dad  She’s a straight talking lady with a wicked sense of humour  but I swear to God  if there’s a joke to be made she’ll make it Obviously not about EVERYTHING  If I’m distressed or in pain of course that’s different  but with day to day things I genuinely feel like I can’t have a serious conversation with her because I’m waiting for the pun  I actually find it quite disheartening  But of course when I try to tell her that  I either come across like I can’t take a joke or I end up laughing in spite of myself  It’s so frustrating Can anyone relate,719,130
75,p9b8z6,0,1,Fear of losing financial and future stability from going to NC   is the loss of comfort worth it  Bit specific but I am seriously considering leaving home and I do have a solid plan laid out  However by doing so I won’t be able to go to college anytime soon since my parents pay for everything  I have a few skills that’ll allow me to work freelance but if I stay at home I’ll be set for life financially since my family’s well off  Leaving is so tempting  It’s been two decades of struggle but I keep wondering if it’s worth giving up all that comfort,554,107
76,p9b2cp,0,1,Im losing my sister over this I told her how I feel about mom  and that I dont think she really cares about me  or that she doesnt try to work on our relationship  So I told her that I dont really see things working out anymore  Well  shes mad at me now  Cause mom is apparently so sad about me  And that she does try  But that I just dont see it  And that I can do things better as well  In a healthy relationship  I would agree with her  But as my mom is likely a covert narc  its a bit different  Not that I told her this  I thought that would do more damage than good  The heartbreaking thing is  Im now starting to doubt myself again because I dont want to lose her over this  But I guess the damage is already done  I regret ever telling her this now,770,154
77,p9azxq,0,1,Toxic relationship with parents Hi to yall  Im new on this group  I read some of the discussions started in here and I think it would be helpful for me to explain here my situation  Before I start  Im sure my parents arent the worst here  but their personalities are pretty toxic for someone who has to live with them    Im a  yo   cm tall   gt   and  kilos   lbs   If someone had to hang out with me  he would always see me smile and joke  but the sad reality is that Im deluded and in my life Ive numerous times been thinking of committing suicide  All because of my parents  This thoughts were far more numerous when I was a kid  about  to   before calming down until I was this age  Im not a dominant person  often trying to do my best to help others and disappear when I feel unnecessary and unneeded  This is a result of the jail my parents put me in during these years  where I have to obey their every order  I have always been scared of them and the only thing that kept driving me was the hope of becoming bigger and stronger  in order to defend myself from them  Now to my parents  My mother was born in a military family  As a result  she is very strict  often resulting in her using violence as a method of both punishment and encouragement  I remember when I was a  years old  she broke a rolling pin on my wrist  A new one she had brought the week before  And that wasnt the worst  She has probably always dreamed of a kid she could be proud of  and I have done my best to meet her expectations  I play volleyball in the first squad  where people are usually two times my age  challenging them for the spot in the titulars  I have brilliant result at school  making my school seem like a playground and Im extremely well behaved  Im luckier than some  because my parents compliment me and in my life they showed to care about me  but it isnt a less toxic situation  I always think Im not enough for what I do  If my friends dont message me  if a girl isnt interested in me  if I cant do something at school and in the gym  Im simply not enough  My father is a unempathetic person  He works at home  having almost zero contact with others  This transformed his job of teaching me about life to plasmating me in the best kid ever  Loving me when I do something he likes  hating  no  Im not joking  he often overreacts  reaching physical punishment  when I dont behave like he taught me My father and my mother hate my phone  telling me how much time I waste on it  I myself have grown to hate my waste of time  I use my phone about  hours a day during schooltime  which may seem a great amount of time  but when contextualized its not that great  I try to hang out with my friends in the evening  so I have to chat with them  plus my homework is in the phone  because my teachers use Google Classroom  Im sorry if I bragged too much  but I wanted to write about this in the most concise yet precise way possible  I dont expect advises  but they are more than welcomed  Thank you to all those who read this  Im truly thankful  I want to know I dont deserve to die  That Im not useless,3151,604

81,p99z6p,0,1,I F am recalling all these fucked up things my mom  F  used to do    LONG VENT   I’m moved out now  and her and I do not talk or see each other at all as I am being shunned for religious reasons   you can read my story on my page for more on that   but lately I’ve been having such a hard time sleeping at night because I’m so torn with feeling like shit about myself  and wondering what is wrong with me  and why am I so hard to love  yet it seems to come instantaneously with my other four siblings  gonna list some things off the top of my head  before I do  here’s some background so the list can make sense  I am the second oldest of my five siblings  there are  different dads so we are pretty blended  order from oldest to youngest goes like this  changing names for sake of privacy  Aidan  M  half brother  has own dad  Me  F  same dad as brother below  Wesley  M  only full blooded brother  Ezra  M  half brother  has same dad as sister below Fiona  F  half sister  Things off the top of my head    when I was in kindergarten to first grade  I remember my mom constantly pretended to drop me off and leave me at graveyards and cemeteries in the winter when I had an attitude or made her upset  I remember crying and holding onto the door handles of the car pleading as my mom allowed Aidan to open the door  pull me out  and then jump back in and zoom off as I tried to scramble to my feet  boogery nosed and terrified  running after the car  as my older brother laughed while sticking his head out the window while I continued to run to which she’d of course speed up and disappear over the horizon  I’d just fall to the ground on the sandy dirt road  as the frost bit my face and cry for what felt like an eternity before she’d come back    Urinated on my bare mattress  soaked it to the point I had to throw it away and sleep on the floor for weeks because of an argument    when I was around   she gave me a black eye while she was driving and I was in the passenger  shortly after  while in a bad neighborhood  she leans over  still driving  and opens my door  unbuckles my seatbelt  and screams at me to get out of the car  Again  I was pleading with her even as she began pushing me with her free hand that wasn’t on the wheel  I fell out and rolled onto the side of the street  Cars behind us witnessed it all   Because we were on our way to pick up Ezra and Wesley from school  she said not to worry about changing my clothes since we weren’t getting out of the car  so all I was wearing was shorts  a tank top with no bra  one sock  and no shoes   I wandered that bad neighborhood crying and desperately trying to call anyone to pick me up before she of course  came and found me  and began apologizing like crazy    took my lock away for talking past hours on the phone to my biological dad  this resulted in many embarrassing no knock walk ins where I’d be partially or entirely naked  and then my stepdad or brothers would embarrassingly close the door    when Aidan made the choice to be homeless because he didn’t want to follow the no drugs in the house rule  my mom frequently woke me up in the middle of the night and crawled into my bed while I was nearly  and would sob heavily over her nightmares about something bad happening to my older brother  I would comfort her as she laid on me    Made it a point to humiliate me in front of guys I was dating by saying “I hope looks are all that matter to you because she can’t cook a hot meal or do a load of laundry if her life depended on it  I remember when she used to go weeks without showering or brushing her teeth ”  I am now moved out and am a great cook  and can do laundry just fine  with a house of  people  the washer and dryer was always packed so I couldn’t find time to wash my clothes between work and school  and the exaggerated poor hygiene was a result of Aidan taking his infamous   hour long showers multiple times a day  and not letting anyone in to get anything  when the bathroom was free  I took care of myself     pinning me down against my bed and threatening me  repeating “you wanna fucking box  You wanna go  I’ll break you in half easily because I think you forget I’m twice your size and can easily beat the shit out of you ” just spit droplets hitting my face while I hold back tears and bite my tongue before she gets up and walks out of my room saying “That’s what I thought ”  her putting her hands on me and threatening to beat me was a constant thing  I never dared to lay a hand on her because I knew she was right  I’ve never put hands on my mother   this all happened because she was disappointed I was doing bad in school  I was  at the time  this would be the same argument that pushed me to book a greyhound ticket to a whole different state to stay with my biological dad who I hadn’t seen in over  years because I needed space from her    when I was going through puberty  I couldn’t get comfortable with pads because even the maxi pads would bleed through my heavy flow  and tampons scared me and were painful every time I tried  so I began stuffing large amounts of toilet paper in my underwear because I found this was the only thing that stopped the mess  when we were going into church one day  I guess my mom told my stepdad because she found out a few days prior by questioning why the toilet paper kept running out so fast  And my stepdad upon observation and seeing the toilet paper outline through my dress  began calling me “donkey balls”  Aidan and Wesley and even my mom had the time of their lives laughing  I was anemic    starting at  when my parents decided to get a divorce  she began leaning on me very heavy and would come into my room at night after we moved into apartments and left our childhood house  she would express how she just wants to take her car and drive off a cliff or blow her brains out and just die  and that there is nothing in life that brings her happiness   Even though she had  whole kids at the time   Being so young I was would just cry and beg her not to  and then she’d just get up and go to sleep  I wouldn’t be able to sleep the rest of the night  terrified that I’d wake up and not have a mom anymore    calling the police on me for “domestic disturbance” when i tried to come visit Wesley after I was disassociated from the religion and was being shunned  She told me that she has not been keeping any of my siblings from reaching out to me  that they haven’t reached out to me because “they don’t want a relationship with you ” I ubered there  and when she came back outside after giving me permission to speak to Wesley privately  and began calling the police  I just once again  humiliated  left on foot crying walking down the street  I had no weapons and did not try to enter into the home   I had not even been moved out for a year yet     constantly asking people right in front of me “don’t you think she would look far more beautiful if she had long straight hair ” right after I chopped my curly hair into a short off the shoulder fro  pressuring me to flat iron it before special occasions  job interviews  meeting a boy she liked for me for the first time  etc  I would get so angry because it was so often she’d make such a huge deal    not checking in on how I was doing emotionally when my older brother attempted to overdose in front of me and the two youngest  he just went to the kitchen cabinet and began opening every prescription bottle of pills and downing them all as I tried to stop him  he ends up leaving the house  as I’m pulling on him begging and trying to get him to stay  but he’s too strong and he leaves out the front door  since I’m watching Ezra and Fiona while my parents are working  I couldn’t leave to chase him and didn’t have a car yet  so I had to call the police who phoned the ambulance even though I told them he isn’t at home over the phone   ambulances and  police cars later  parents rushed home after the police have already searched our house  they find him by a convenient store  mom is crying as she listens to the ordeal on the police radio because he’s trying to run and refuse detainment  they catch him  and he is baker acted in the hospital  he didn’t want to see me in there  and still resents me to this day from stopping him  that was traumatic as hell for me  as I was made to feel like it was my fault  and nobody came to see how I was doing  but all  of my other siblings are asked by my mom and stepdad if they’re okay and are all talked to separately  allowing my stepdad to put me in a headlock in front of my three younger siblings  I was by the front door wanting to go for a drive to cool off after a heated discussion because I was  and should be able to do that  but because it was close to pm  my stepdad chases me to the door and puts me in the headlock to the point I’m struggling to breathe and crying to let me go and that I can’t breathe  and my mom is standing there saying “yeah just go  just go and abandon your siblings just like Aidan ” and then she turns my attention to the corner of the hallway where all of my siblings are peering  there staring at me  I hate that day so much  It makes me choke up with anger  I am very sensitive about hands around my neck to this day  even if it’s in a playful manner because of this incident and ones like it   a year later from this incident  while my stepdad is at work  my mom creates yet another argument out of thin fucking air while I’m in my room  just about how I’m not doing the things I’m supposed to be  and that she’s disappointed I’m not where I should be at in life  she kicks me out again in front of my siblings  and I drive off to a grocery store parking lot and just cry alone in my car  I end up coming back a few hours later and she once again  apologizes and says she didn’t mean it    always making me feel like I couldn’t come to her for help when I needed it  I remember being  or so and my car ran out of gas to get to work  luckily I was able to pull into a gas station before it gave out on me  but I just remember checking my bank account and crying to myself in my car because I didn’t know who I could ask    Had knowledge that I was struggling financially in my arranged marriage   which I am free from now   knew that I was being raped  physically abused  and verbally abused  knew that I didn’t have toilet paper to wipe my ass  paper towels  dish soap  laundry detergent  gas money  food  that I had received multiple eviction notices  knew that I needed HELP  but instead told one of my friends who relayed it back to me that “I hope she knows if she gets evicted  she’s not welcome back here  She got herself into this mess  she can get herself out of it  then expressed her intense disappointment in me for getting a divorce and leaving the religion and betraying the family   Yet when Aidan was “homeless ” she spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars buying him new phones  booking him the most luxury bus tickets to get to whatever state he was needing to get to  sending him money for food  for clothes  just anything   in case you couldn’t tell  Aidan has first born favorite privileges with mom  this list could go on forever  my family has put me through so much shit  and I have done nothing but try my best to stay out of the way and not create more problems  I paid for things myself  I helped pick up Wesley  Ezra  and Fiona most days from school when I started driving  I gave up a social life to babysit constantly  I’ve spoiled my the youngest two and continued to care for them even after moving out  took them on trips  did arts and crafts with them  built forts  took them dolphin watching at the pier on the weekends  to the fair  movies  sleepovers at my apartment  stayed up til daylight playing video games  I just feel like so used and thrown away  Like the giving tree at the end  just a stump  accept nobody comes and appreciates me despite just being a stump  I feel all used up and without any value anymore  I feel like back then no one ever saw me  or made a big deal about my accomplishments or even told me they loved me  my mom was trimming my hair one time  and she moved the curtain of hair from my face to pause and say  “I love you ” It was so out of nowhere and I hadn’t heard her say that in so long  that as soon as she moved the hair back to continue trimming  a lump instantly formed in my throat and tears rolled down my face  Our relationship is so strange and I hate how much I adored her and how hard it is to not miss her because I can hardly think of a day she didn’t find a way to make me feel like absolute shit  The toy story  scene where Jessie has a flashback of when she used to be loved by her kid  that song “when she loved me”  really messes with me  I just want to be able to move on  It feels so pathetic even writing this  I wanna not cry anymore  I want to forget  I just have so much anxiety and fear of abandonment and fear that I’m gonna be a failure of a mother to my first child that I’m currently pregnant with  Confusion  I ask myself daily  “when is it that I became trash ” I just feel so alone  I HATE THIS,13195,2568
82,p99v0w,0,1,Does your parents ask money monthly  So here I am  my parent started asking me money on monthly basis aggressively  They say I owe them because they are my parents  basically they are saying that I should start repaying them because they raised me  Fuck that  me and my siblings were not even allowed to play growing up  It is a nightmare  we have to save money to buy our own stuff like literally  I finish school by scholarship and yet they dont credit me enough for that   Now I completely blocked so they cant contacr me anymore,533,99
83,p99swv,0,1,Loss of autonomy and built in fear So I moved out of my parent’s house in  at age  after I stuck up for myself against my nmom for the first time  Her reaction was that she was going to as she said “knock me to the ground in such a way that I wouldn’t want to get up” they were always very verbally abusive and such but never physical  I was adopted as a young teen and I often wondered growing up if they regretted it everyday and that’s why they acted like they hated me so much  They would make me clean the whole house and wouldn’t offer any help but if I missed the smallest thing I would be degraded and it was the end of the world  I was worthless to them for making the smallest mistakes  When I finally left I went to a friend’s house and saw the way they were living and it was upsetting for me because I would put so much effort and emphasis on cleaning everything before bed and everything I did had to be perfect  I started having a panic attack over the dishes not being done and when I calmed down I was told that it was fine if they weren’t done cause it was late and could be done later  They asked me why I cared so much about dirty dishes and I literally responded with “cause we’ll be in trouble if it’s not done before your parents go to sleep ” And at that point I realized that the way I was raised was by tyrants to the point that I didn’t know what to do without someone telling me what I was allowed to do  It is very upsetting though that when I go to their house now my mom never does the dishes and when my sister doesn’t do them no one ever says anything,1591,321
84,p99lg3,0,1,Small victories  Outsmarting a narcissistic parent We all know how it can seem almost impossible to beat a narcissistic parent at their own games   Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent   I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom   Feel free to share yours   I wrote about the following in a reply to someone elses post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent I grew up in the s and s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes  Even when I was elementary school aged  I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes  I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking   When I entered my teen years  I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore   She eventually stopped asking However  one day  I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends  My parents had no objection  Later in the day  my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends  I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore  I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing Anyway  her sweet demeanor suddenly changed  and through her clenched jaw  she informed me   Fine  Then you will NOT be using the car this evening   However  her threat didnt sway me  and I told her fine  I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said   Sorry  we cant go to the movie  My mom wont let me use the car because I wont go buy her cigarettes  Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend  her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment  The narcissist in my mom couldnt stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car  Her demeanor once again suddenly changed  and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line  she exclaimed with fake laughter   Oh wait  wait  Hold on  You know I was only kidding  Ha ha ha  So not only did I get to use the car after all  I semi shamed my mom  and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again   I have been living in Japan for about  years   I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family   Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me   As you can imagine  it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year  plus spending money while Im there  etc   Despite this  I have never played the  poor card  and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket   My mom  on the other hand  has offered a number of times to either  chip in  or  go half  on the cost of a ticket   A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket   However  I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached   In fact  out of all these offers and in all my time living here  I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight About eight or nine years ago  the last time I ever accepted her offer   she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas   I initially refused and told her it wasnt necessary  However  she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent   She was going on about how she knows its a lot of money to come home twice a year  how she does things to help my sisters  but  because I live in Japan  she and my dad cant help me as much as they would like  etc I finally relented  but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad  which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do  before she went offering to buy an almost   dollar plane ticket for me   She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours When I phoned back  my moms caring and supportive attitude had completely changed   She was now using her half annoyed half righteous tone with me  the one where she elongates the last word in every clause sentence    So I talked to your faaatherrr  and he and I have deciiideeddd    She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden   She told me that she and my dad would  help me out  this time by paying for my ticket  but  its about time you considered moving back to Canada because we cant afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan  I thought to myself   Okay  here we go again    But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered  but if it were too much trouble  it wasnt necessary  and not to worry about    No  No   Thats fiiiine   Well buy your ticket this tiiiime   But you need to think about moving baaack    Of course  I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket   I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my moms attitude and he had no say in  their  decision that I should move back to Canada I got off the phone and though  F    it   Im not going back for Christmas   and I meant it   I waited until the next day  and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story  I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible   I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket  but it really wasnt necessary   It was so nice of him to support my moms offer to pay for my ticket  but I really didnt expect them to buy it   I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer  but it was too generous and I wouldnt be able to accept it   In fact  Ive decided to stay in Japan over the holidays Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad  my phone started ringing   Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return   I had apparently  misunderstood  what she had said  she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket  and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas   All I needed to do was book my ticket  let her know how much it would cost  and she would put the money on my credit card   When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a  bad back   in reality  she couldnt stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work   she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care   after school care because it was a waste of money   Appreciative of my moms offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month  my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer   Big mistake To give my mom credit  she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part  but even that has its limits when shes feeling like holding one of her pity parties   It doesnt help that my niece  since she was a small child and even now at  years old  is prone to outbursts  breakdowns  and temper tantrums   As my niece got a little bit older  my moms over reactions to my nieces over reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over react to the slightest misbehaviour When she was seven years old  my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school  and not to be outdone  my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself   She phoned my sister to work in hysterics  not the first time  literally bawling about my sisters  out of control  disrespectful  hateful  horrible child   you get the picture    And my mom sobbed on and on about how  I just cant take it anymore   Its just too much   Ive had enough  YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter    My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background  who knows where my dad had escaped to   My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone After getting off the phone  my sister realized that saving money on day care   after school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse   So before she went to pick up her kids  my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after school care for my niece and nephew When my sister arrived at my parents  my mom came running to the door in hysterics  her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind  ranting about my sisters ungrateful daughter    You need to do something about YOUR children  my nephew was now apparently caught up in this   WAAAA      As my sister is trying to get her kids coats and boots on  she told my mom to calm down and that  having a temper tantrum over your seven year old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isnt going to solve anything    My mom for the umpteenth time   YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter   I cant take it   WAAAA     At which point my sister told my mom to  grow up  and that she didnt need to  take it anymore  because from the next day  the kids would both be in after school care and walked out the door   At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming   No    No    Why     nieces name     No    Why     as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away My sister didnt go no contact with my mom after that  but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again  my sister refused and kept them in after school care Any stories from any of you about poetic retribution,10136,1951
85,p99fwe,0,1,My mom is fuming because she found out I am not gonna get my horrible sister anything for her birthday I have another post that goes into more detail  but basically  two weeks before my th birthday I got some money the government still owed me  My mom expected me to get my sister an expensive present for her  because my sister  who earns a lot more money than me  always buys presents for me for my birthday while I often make things for her by hand  crochet   Where my mom got the idea that my sister was somehow  owed  any of MY money  idk  I bought something nice for myself after months of saving up for it  That was enough for my sister to not get me anything for my birthday  which was  weeks later  and also just leave the house later in the day to go sleep at her boyfriends house or something  I later found out my mom was actually the one who encouraged her to get me nothing  My birthday was fucking ruined  When I arrived at school the next day  a Monday  my classmates threw a better birthday for me than my family had  which was just kinda sad as we literally celebrated my birthday during a Geography class  weeks ago  my sister mocked the fact that I was raped by my ex boyfriend at the dinner table  She said  I get why he raped you  Actually  I dont  you are ugly and nobody would want to rape you anyway  Needless to say  that comment absolutely crushed me  I have been in specialized TF CBT and EMDR therapy for the fact that I was raped  and was diagnosed with PTSD when I was   mostly because of the event  It has ruined my life  and I still suffer from the after effects every day of my life  I have tried to avoid my sister  but my mom asked me today what I was gonna get her for her th birthday  which is in  days  I said  nothing  My mom absolutely exploded on me  She said she could not understand how I was so selfish  I asked her if she could not see why  and told her because of that comment  She said I was holding  old events  over her head  that I was lazy and selfish  and that I will ruin her birthday My mom apparently thinks that  not getting my sister an expensive gift for no reason from the money I was owed  within  weeks after getting it  was a sin great enough to skip my birthday and ruin it over  but my sister mocking the most severely traumatic event that has ever happened to me is not   amp  xB I am planning on staying with my partner for a few days until my sisters birthday is over  I am scared of my sister  My therapist has been ghosting me since Juli  I cannot reach her anywhere  Therapy sessions have abruptly stopped  I have nobody to talk to about this  I feel so alone,2665,505

90,p98wdo,0,1,Thinking about cutting off contact with Nmom I’ll try to be as brief as possible My parents separated when I was very young and my mom eventually won full custody and moved me out of state away from my father  stepmom  and my new brother and sister  Nmom said awful  untrue  things about my father to me growing up and threatened to commit suicide in front of me two times when I was   or so  She claims that never happened  After being married for  years and having a child  I am now divorced and have spent the last   with an amazing woman   we have two more kids of our own and a house but aren’t married  We were traveling this summer and invited my mom to stay with us for a week and visit the grandkids  She was so insulted that we had told her that her visit would be capped at  nights that she texted the night before that she wasn’t coming  The next morning I awoke to her texting me that she was on the plane  After an awkward five days together  my mom finally decided to unload on me that she thinks my partner is “bossy” and that the one week visit limit was her idea and I was weak for going along with it  The three of us had a sit down and my partner told my mother that she didn’t have to like her but she had to respect her  My mother showed so much respect to her she left on the next flight out of town two hours later  a day earlier than planned  without even saying goodbye   That was six weeks ago and we haven’t spoken since  Last week mother called my  year old and told her that she didn’t know why I was mad at her but I am acting childish and haven’t called her in months  She did however text me to say that she would be cutting me off financially from her  removing me as beneficiary of her accounts  and even stopping the   she puts monthly into my childrens college funds  I have been successful enough on my own to not need her money  but we do live in a house that she helped us buy a few years ago so she is on the deed and mortgage with us  She has shown so little regard for my partner  the boundaries we wished to uphold  and my own happiness that I am considering never speaking to her again  I just found this forum and any advice for how to deal with her is appreciated,2232,441

101,p981fc,0,1,Yet another “you’ll take care of me in my old age right ”  I’m literally camping out in the bathroom as I type this bc she snipes whenever she sees my phone and my desk with computer is right beside hers  It happens now and then  In any discussion topic where old people are brought up  my asian mother will always find a way to sweetly say “See  you have to be kind and good to your mom  You’re the only child so you’ll have to take of me when I’m older  You’ll let me live with you so you can take care of me right  ” I feel like such a piece of shit every time this happens  I have to say “yes” because any other reply is unthinkable  but she always detects my insincerity and gets unhappy and I can’t convincingly pretend I care for her I just can’t do it  Also in asian cultures  having older generations live with the younger is standard because it’s expected for children to take care of their parents  It makes me want to die every time I think about it  My dream is to move halfway across the world and never see my parents again  but as the only child I can’t do that  My mother can’t control her anger  is childish at times and is an emotionally manipulative narc  but she and my dad have worked really hard to fund my schooling extracurriculars and going NC would be a poor way to repay their effort  Yet I’m depressed and probably have some sort of PTSD from surviving at home  I have a lot of emotional issues from surviving her and having no good example to learn from  I don’t know what I’m going to do  As a short term plan I’m banking on getting into a university that’s across the country so I’ll have some semblance of freedom even if they’re paying for it  But even if I get in I don’t know what I’ll do after  I will not move back to my home city  I cannot bear to do so  My parents will expect me to repay their efforts  The only thing I can think of would be to somehow get a job that makes enough money to pay for a senior care home and I’ll send them money from wherever I live   though the issue with that is I’ll have to pay the brunt of it bc we’re a low middle income family  And I’ll have to pay for  them living in an expensive city while also sustaining myself  I despair every time thinking about what to do  If I can manage to become financially independant there’s technically nothing stopping me from going NC but I have no idea how to completely go independent  There’s always bound to be some kind of form or document or bank statement that my parents have to agree to sign that my mom will never do to ensure I can’t leave her  Esp  because they have saved up some money for me and since I’m going into science med it’ll be a long time before I can get a stable job and be unreliant on their money funding my education  And it’s worse that I don’t even live in a terrible household  We always have food  I have endless access to extracurriculars and education  and my parents work long hours to ensure I don’t feel like money is an issue Despair is really the only word to describe what I feel  I don’t know what to do and I constantly feel like I’m stuck forever,3118,599

106,p97uk6,0,1,Ive started to realize what my mom is   So recently  I started to realize how narcissistic my mother is  Ive compared the difference between my mom and dad and how they treat me  My dad always gives my siblings and I  overwhelming love and he tries to help as much as he can and give us space and tips support us despite my parents being divorced  My mom on the other hand  as much as she says she helps me and does things for me  holds those things over my head throws them back in my face and uses them to guilt trip me into feeling bad and doing what she wants me to do Im  now  soon to be   I have to share a car with mom cause I have yet to get help with getting one for myself since she wants to pick it for me  Other than that  the only thing she does for me is let me love at the house rent free and do my laundry  I pay for my own groceries  I pay my phone bill  Buy my own clothes shoes jewelry  etc  I sometimes buy my own dinner when Im out cause in her words  you have all that money saved up  go get yourself dinner   She  quite often  tells me what she thinks I should spend my money on and its frustrating when I say I dont want to cause she always tells me I have more money than her  I can afford it  I should spend that money I worked so hard to build up and save st realization  we were on vacation at my grandmothers house and I assumed we would be leaving by a certain time cause thats what I was told  We would be driving   hours to get back home and I wanted to have ample time to sleep before I had to go to work the day after the next  Well  when I found out we were leaving much later  I was worried and upset we wouldnt get home in time for me to get enough sleep for work or thatd I have to call off an extra day last minute  When I expressed I was upset about that  my mother proceeded to tell me I dont get to act shitty feel shitty about the situation because my grandmother wanted to prepare a meal for us before we left which  im fine with cause I love her cooking  I just didnt enjoy the fact that I was told last minute and now I had to worry about time and work a little extra now  She yelled at me and told me Im acting shitty and it wasnt a set time anyways and I need to get off my attitude  I got even more upset and ran inside after getting loud along with her  I told my grandmother everything and she agreed my mother wasnt the best and if I ever need to talk or vent  I could call her and she could help me as best as she could nd experience  Tom Thumb was having a buy  ice creams for   deal and I had to partake  I was gonna buy it for myself but when I got to the check out with my mom in tow  she offered to help me and buy it for me  I accepted and once the week had passed  I finished one off and planned to eat the other one the Monday of the next week coming up so Id have something to look forward to when I got home from work  My stepdad ate all of it in one night and I told him it was mine  He said hed pay for it  A week goes by and he never bought it  I brought it up and he was pissed about it  My mom butt in and told him that actually  she had bought the ice cream and my stepfather didnt need to pay for it  therefore  it was not mine and they arent gonna buy me a new one since they already paid for a new one  I was upset because  yes  they did technically buy it but it was mine  regardless of who bought it  I was upset to hell and back so I was gonna run to my room but my mom quipped back with a snide comment   yeah  Run up to your room and figure out why youre upset   I wasnt sure what to even say or do so I curled up in my brothers truck  the trunk  and called my grandmother for awhile till it was dark out  This lead to a night where I was leaving for a friends house with ice cream I BOUGHT this time  I jokingly said  how about I take one your ice creams   stepdads name    He proceeded to say  yeah  Sure  But Im taking yours if you do   So I replied You already took one of mine  You cant just take another one  Thats not fair  And he started getting pissed off cause I brought up the ice cream issue again He told me  along with my mom   I pay for this house and the roof over your head  As a matter of fact  hardly anything in this house is yours at all  I brought up every Christmas  every clothing item  every piece of technology  poster  every snack  pair of shoes  purses  books  etc that I bought in this house and that were gifted to me by a family member that wasnt them  I had even bought the dog blankets and one of our dogs beds  Ive paid for their haircuts and nails to get done before too  He responded with same line  very little in this house is yours   Which aggravated me  I dont remember exactly what I said but I replied mocking towards him and my mother and insulted them in some  not by calling them names but in a way that hurt their pride  Ive never called them names in an argument ever  I rushed out of the front door to my friends car with the snacks and my overnight bag and just told her to drive  That apparently really upset my stepdad for once Which I wasnt aware of and from my mothers words  we were just messing around and joking with you  Youre the one who took it too far   She says that and yet she belittled me and made a snide comment and made me buy myself  new things of ice cream  She saw that I had done that and commented that she was gonna buy them for me  She only said that because she saw I bought them  She wasnt going to buy them for me  She forgets everything regarding me unless I remind her or do it my fucking self which I usually end up doing  She guilt tripped into feeling bad for spending my money on a treat I wanted for myself so I can have a reward to look forward to when I get home  rd experience  we were on my way back from work and I finally broke down after stress cause I mentioned the ice cream incident and the reason I wasnt going to ask my stepdad for anything anymore since earlier that morning he said  oh youre finally asking for shit now   Like I dont previously ask for things already  I have to put my name on the things I buy because I cant trust someone not to eat it  No one will buy it for me later if they eat it bc they always have to bring up the fact that they pay the bills and keep the roof over my head My mom blamed me for the entire ice cream incident all because I took everything too far when  in reality  im tired of just glossing over things with her and letting her get away with saying mean shit to me bc she wants to hold power over me in some way  My grandmother helped and told me I need to stand my ground with her  Talk things out and let her know when shes saying something thats bullshit I broke down and yelled at her about it  about how she does this shit all the time  She buys things for us to be nice then throws them back in our face by saying  So I can just take back that Nike jacket right  And all those Christmas gifts  Since you wanna be shitty to me  right   She threatens to take stuff back or remove them or whatever  She denied it  She denied everything brought up because my voice cracking  my emotions were out of control and I was having a mental breakdown in the car sobbing uncontrollably  I brought everything she did that wronged me or fucked up my life in some way  shes not physically abusive   just verbally or mentally manipulative and so on   She denied everything  Turned the conversation around on me and blamed me and said I had been acting ungrateful towards her and making her feel like shit for the past  weeks as if she didnt make me feel like shit for years   weeks is nothing  I realized when I was in therapy  she was the reason for me getting into therapy  She was the soul problem in my life  Unfortunately I had to cancel future appointments due to quitting my awful job and the price going up She tried to say  If you want me to fix things or work on things  you need to work with me  You need to communicate with me  Tell me whats wrong  I told her I didnt want to  I was tired of trying At one point she said  Im the parent    Regardless of the situation  I deserve respect   I replied Thats an excuse  Youre using this as an excuse to be a horrible person  After I said I didnt want to work out things with her She threatened blackmailed me  Well if you wanna use this car to get yourself to work instead of using uber  youre gonna have to communicate with me  I pointed out she was blackmailing threatening me as soon as she finished and she denied it  No Im not  Thats not what I said at all  As soon as we got home  I ran inside  threw my things on a table and ran out of the house all the way to my friends house  hiccuping  sobbing and red faced  I didnt come home for  days  I told her over text that I wanted to talk like adults not  parent and child  and I wanted to be respected  I wanted to be able to finish my sentences without being cut off or talked over  I wanted an apology and I wanted her to think about her actions and words as well like she always raised me to do when Ive hurt my friends or upset them The reason I had brought that up was because my grandmother had told me to tell her where I was  I did cause my grandmother hasnt wronged me  My mom replied with  thank you ❤   which pissed me off cause she always does this after we get into a fight  She tries to act innocent and sweet to patch things up and make me wanna apologize like its nothing or tell her I love her or whatever to make her feel better about the whole situation I sent her the paragraph that I wanted to talk as I stated above   and she just said  Im sorry you feel upset  But we can talk as long as you dont bring up the past  I replied firmly   no  Im allowed to bring up the past because you still treat me the same way as in the past  Nothing has changed  And dont apologize for my emotions  Apologize for your actions  Thats what a proper apology is  Thats what you taught me  Think about that and we can talk tomorrow  We didnt end up talking because I stayed at my friends house later than expected bc I was getting anxious about going home  When I finally went home  things went as if nothing had happened  th  most recent experience  tonight I was forced to clean up after dinner even though I helped cook  My mom said  you didnt clean the last two nights  You brother cleaned the entire kitchen the night before and last night your sister did it by herself  Its your turn to clean  The night before  I had gotten home after being yelled at by my supervisor all day and I had a pinched nerve in my back from being bent over all day cleaning  part of my job to clean all day   I was too tired to clean up and in too much pain Last night  my mom bought fast food for everyone but me because I said Id eat out  The only thing my sister had to clean up was her own damn food  She didnt clean up the whole kitchen  She just threw her food away and that was it  I didnt bring that up because I was getting pissed off Usually I have to call my sister or brother to help me clean up the kitchen so its not just me but my mom always gives them a pass not to help out  It frustrates me because just as much as my brother has a job and my sister has school  I also have a job too  Its just as tiring and Im getting yelled at or forced to rush my work all day in the heat as well I couldnt be more pissed off with her so finished the kitchen  clearly making a racket with how pissed I was and she yelled at me to stop acting pissed off about the situation then I went upstairs  She came in later and said the same line she always says if we get into a fight before we all settle down for bed Goodnight  I still love you though  Followed by either Even if you dont love me back   Even if you dont think I do  And sometimes shell try to hug me and Ill push her off and deny her which only makes her more upset because she so desperately wants me to apologize and pretend nothing happened and to forgive her as if she didnt say the meanest shit to me about me She does this constantly and always the same way  Ive memorized it at this point and I always expect it when I hear her coming up the stairs  I even know what her footsteps sound like  Other experiences  shell invite me out with her to places where she plans to buy things and she wont tell me Im paying for myself till Im checking things out  She does it all the time when we go to get our nails done  She doesnt tell me till we get there that Im paying for myself but when I deny that I dont wanna pay for something I can do at home shell say  all that money you have  You can afford it  But be stingy   She sometimes even tells me I should buy certain things or tells me I should get things that I wasnt even looking to invest in or buy for myself  She always brings up how I have the money for it but Im saving as much of money for my future car and the future college and apartment when I move out cause Im sick of living here and being treated like this  Spent a couple of my high school summers watching my sister and I was never allowed to even step foot outside  Not for the mail  Not to sit in the backyard  Not to sit on the front porch front steps  Not to even walk the dog  I was slowly getting more and more depressed  I was mentally spacing out more and more where I felt like I wasnt even mentally clocked in whenever I was awake during those couple months  It felt like I was in autopilot  I wasnt even allowed to sleep in bc anything could happen to my sister while Im sleeping  When all she did was sit on her phone or watch YouTube  She would always tell me Im not allowed to be upset about it bc at least she paid me for it and my sister is my responsibility  when I had a brother who could watch her just fine too   She said she should be making me watch her for free since Im sister and this is what Im supposed to do but  shes being nice and paying me   Sometimes shed pay me by getting me a bag of chips I wanted  Id sometimes ask her if she could get me a small bag of chips and shed say that was my allowance for the week and if I really wanted it then she could do that but she wouldnt pay   Which was fucking ridiculous because a small   bag of chips doesnt have the same value as   for watching and working like a babysitter  I told her about this too and she denied it  Said my sister called her crying bc she didnt know where I had gone when Id tell her Im walking the dog or just sit on the porch right by the front door  Shed still cry and scream even when I did leave the house and call my mom crying and screaming about it  Then my mom would come home later and yell at me about it or call me and yell at me Before I realized I cant actually talk to her about my problems  I tried to tell her about them and she always told me Im not allowed to be upset or feel a certain negative emotion  act shitty  because whatever Im upset about is my responsibility and I should just figure out how to deal with it or stop crying because its such a small thing to be upset over And I swear she judges me on what I wear and the jobs I get and how I need to power through shitty jobs for the money  I dont like working for people who dont give me enough hours or treat me like shit yell at me on a constant basis when Im giving my all and doing my best as it is  Another thing  I try to show my gratitude to her for letting me use her car so much and  keeping a roof over my head and letting me live rent free at home   By paying for the dogs important things like food  nail trims  haircuts  treats  shots  etc  Getting gas as often as I can  Occasionally going out of my way to get her a coffee food just to be nice and helping her out cooking for her or walking the dogs helping out with my sister and so on but she likes to call me ungrateful all the time  I even try to tell her verbally that I appreciate what she  does  for me etc  Still told Im ungrateful She also likes to talk over me alot or cut me off when I try to stand my ground or genuinely speak to her over something she said Im sorry this was so long but I dont have anywhere else to get this out at and I saw this thread and kinda just   immediately went to venting  I mean  I accept advice if anyone has any but I kinda already have a plan to speak to her about these matters  Im just   putting this out there for the ears willing to listen,16509,3257

110,p97bhb,0,1,Going back home syndrome The Ultimate gaslight when you have immigrant parents is when they spend your entire childhood convincing you that your situation is temporary  My parents moved a lot and so my Nmom would tell me not to get comfortable in school or bother to make friends because we would move  Jokes on her I was always bullied and had no friends even when I tried  And when we finally settled down somewhere and I was in middle school and started to make some friends  She always spoke terribly about them or said some racist bs  If none of those things worked she would say  well none of this matters because we plan to go back to  third world hone country  we are just here to make money and leave  So in the back of my mind I just was never sure  We have large extended family there and I always thought it was possible  Fast forward almost two decades       And I recommend to my Nmom that we all just move back to  home country  because I got to live there for a year and honestly thought it wasn’t so bad  Her reaction  starts hysterically laughing  Looks at me with disgust saying “we would never move back there   home country  is disgusting and has disgusting people  You’d never survive long term  Keep those ridiculous ideas to yourself ” So we were never going to go back  but I spent my entire child good and teen years filled with anxiety and fear that at any given moment my life would suddenly change because of another move  Pardon my language but Nmom is a fucking bitch and I hate her,1526,279

117,p95wg1,0,1,Parents denying me medical attention Hi  Im kind of venting here  but I would like to hear your own experiences with these kind of situations Have your parents ever denied you medical attention  I remember that when I was   I got an ear infection and my mother got really angry at me  and shamed me    She then completely ignored my problem and I had to deal with the infection myself   My knees started to fail me at high school  I dont know what it is because my mom said it was my fault for not exercising  I cant walk straight now My first year of college was going pretty well  but I got migraines every single day  I didnt have any money and asked  my mom for help  and instead of helping me she ignored me saying it was just a phase and then shamed me when I started to fail every class I feel like I have to make a list of all the shit they did to me because I forget  and I need to cut contact from them eventually Im trying to keep going but its pretty hard when I lack support  Im pretty close to getting a job and getting the hell out of the place Im living  I know shes going to threaten to call the police on me saying I am missing,1169,225
118,p95lei,0,1,NParents always had to be right I was never allowed to have my own opinions  It didnt matter if it was more serious stuff like politics or religion  or more mundane stuff like which shows were good and which ones werent  Theyd always argue with me  And it wasnt like friendly debate either  theyd interrupt me  talk over me  and use circular logic or oversimplified arguments to try and make me sound dumb  They always had to finish by asserting that they were right  Even if I shut up  theyd still come to me with articles online or other arguments about why I was wrong after I thought we were done with the subject  My dad would just shake his head and say stuff like  if you could hear yourself youd think you were a total idiot right now   and my mom would just widen her eyes  get this smirk on her face  and say stuff like  youre wroooooong    really loudly Im ashamed to say that it made me feel really guilty whenever I was proven wrong by anybody  If someone proved me wrong about something  Id usually just shut down completely  People thought I myself was a narcissist because I couldnt handle being wrong  but I just remembered the ridicule and the lack of freedom to choose my own opinions,1217,220
119,p95kfe,0,1,Has anyone ever let an n parent back into their lives after nc  I have been nc with my nmom for about  years  She has sent me gifts a handful of times since then but we haven’t spoken  I don’t know if it’s like love bombing since it’s only been about  times in  years and she never sends a message along or anything  They are usually just small things she’s found that she thinks I’d like I guess  Lately I’ve been feeling sentimental and missing her  The good parts of her  The bad parts of our relationship are so overwhelmingly bad though and have caused so many issues that I’ve been working on in therapy for a year  I know she hasn’t changed because my siblings have told me how she treats them  Even the golden child of the family has to deal with her narcissistic tendencies  But I have recently decided I wanted to go to cosmetology school which was a dream of my nmom’s when she was younger  I thought it might be nice if we did it together  maybe i could help her get started and it would be an experience to bond us and her getting to reach a goal she always wanted might help her heal from the traumas that make her the way she is  But I also feel like I’m being delusional and the moment I reach out to her it will just open a door for more pain and set back the progress I’ve made in therapy  So has anyone had a similar situation and how did it turn out,1385,271
120,p95hqd,0,1,The first act of genuine love I ever experienced did more damage to my life than you could possibly imagine  Very long post  Im sorry  My parents never loved me  Im sure all of you experienced the same thing  My mother viewed me as a lapdog that she grew sick of the moment I learned I didnt have to be attached to her  My father viewed me as an embarrassing burden on his life that he never wanted  He told me as much  I grew up with no love  I wasnt allowed to have friends as a child  I suspect many of you grew up the same way  I didnt experience real  genuine love for the very first time until I was   I had a girlfriend  Ill just use her name because theres nothing else identifying about her in this story  her name was Kayla  Kayla and I had a tumultuous relationship  I was extremely messed up mentally and emotionally  and honestly  she was too  I didnt know what love was  I didnt know what it felt like  i didnt know how to express it  I knew nothing about it She watched me suffer for over a year  trying her best to support me  I was very unappreciative of her support  but Ive tried my best to make up for it since then  Anyway  the first act of love  When I was   I was on the brink of ending my life  I was so exhausted from the loveless  abusive  horrifying life I was forced into  She had supported me for so long  at that moment she realized that I needed help beyond what she had to offer So  as I was contemplating the end  she called a social worker  told her about my situation  and the social worker showed up to my front door  Under threat of CPS involvement  my parents begrudgingly had me admitted into a psychiatric hospital  where I stayed for nearly  months  I call this an act of genuine love because Kayla knew how much I would resent her for this  I dreaded and despised the idea of going to one of those hospitals  Id avoid it at all costs  She knew this  she knew I would hate her for making that decision  but she made it anyway She loved me in a way no one else ever had in that moment  She chose my safety and well being over me liking her  over our relationship  She made an impossibly hard decision and she did it because she wanted me to be safe more than she wanted to be in a relationship with me  I was   she uprooted my life more than anyone else had before  and for a while  I did resent her for it  I wasnt mentally stable enough or emotionally mature enough to give her the credit she deserved  so her doing this did destroy our relationship  We didnt speak for nearly three years Her decision was based entirely on love  but it did damage my life severely  I disappeared from school for  consecutive months  My school counselor did everything the state said they could to help me recover from it  but ultimately my GPA dropped from a   to a    just from the sheer amount of schoolwork I missed  Catching up was just about impossible  And honestly  a   GPA is extremely hard to recover from  So my performance in school fell apart when I got back  I gave up on the idea of college because my transcript was beyond fucked before I even got to Sophomore year  When I came back to school  everyone had questions  I disappeared for two entire months without a word  people wanted to know  and I didnt have a story to tell them  Eventually I confided in someone the real reason I was gone  and like a wildfire  word got out that I spent a long time in the psych hospital  So suddenly it was like I was a plague victim  No one wanted to be near me  They thought I was crazy  I lost all my friends  never got them back   I struggled to make new ones because everyone just viewed me as the kid who spent  months in a crazy people hospital  I never really did make new friends after that  I was alone the rest of high school  and yeah  a lot of it was from the bitterness  I was bitter  Who wouldnt be  But the most damaging part of it all  all the walls I had built up to protect myself from my parents  they were gone  Completely gone  And on top of that  now my mother had more ammo to use against me than she ever had before  and she still uses it to this day Anytime I said anything she didnt like  anytime I questioned her or criticized anything she said or did  it was  Is this you talking or the mental illness talking  Every time i expressed an ounce of unhappiness at anything  whether intentional or not  it was  dont take it out on me just because  youre  mentally ill She would make a point to go into my room every couple weeks and ask  so     are you still crazy or has that gone away yet    the exact words she used  She did this every few weeks for  years  Anytime I was unhappy  anytime I didnt like something  anytime I protested  anytime I did or said    anything    that she wasnt favorable of  it was  this isnt you  youre just sick  One decision fucked up my life so fucking badly  And that decision was the very first act of genuine love I ever had in my entire love Can you imagine how complicated of a feeling that is The  first time anyone ever loves me   and it    destroys    me  Kayla and I made amends some while ago  and I still send her a text every few weeks to let her know that I appreciate her  She was honestly the first person in my life to ever actually love me  and Ill never forget that  But  just imagine how you would feel if you went  years with a life   void of love  and then the first love you ever feel destroys your life for the next  years,5536,1045

127,p94xze,0,1,No Contact Letter   Kids involved I told my nmom that I wanted her to  stop contacting me almost  months ago  but she did not listen  no surprise there   I had only told her over the phone  so I am going to write a letter asking her to stop contacting me so that I have the option to pursue a restaining order against her if she still ignores my request  Our situation is complicated because we have a daughter in elementary school who she wants control of  She texts me exery other week asking to be able to take our daughter for the night or for dinner without us present  and only twice in the  months did she ever even ask how my daughter was doing  or about how horrible of a daughter and mother I am for doing this to her and keeping her away from our daughter  She sends packages of random gifts to our house for my daughter  Backstory We originally decided to go NC with my nmom because she undermined us as parents and was trying to raise our daughter to be like herself and my sister   the golden child  She acted as if she and I were divorced parents and she was the one who could decide how our daughter would be raised  She has never accepted my boyfriend as a father to our daughter because he is not her biological father even though he has been her only father figure and has been since she was almost yo  She used to take our daughter for the weekends but then our daughter would come back and behave horribly at our house and was not developing a sense of self  acting instead like a carbon copy of my nmom and gc sister  She would have extended family visit and would not tell us and instead do activities with the extended family acting as though she was our daughters mother  which is how her side of the family treats them   we do not exist apparently   Any time she would invite us to do something with them as well it was always only to use our car or because she wanted us to help with   do all of   some sort of manual labor while they hung out  She would ignore basic safety such as requiring our dauhgter to wear a seatbelt on  short drives   She also constantly threatened to call the cops on me for the welfare of our daughter if we would not meet up exactly when she wanted for her to take our daughter for the weekend  Before we decided to go NC  I did try to talk to her over the phone about the issues we were having but instead of listening and trying to work on a solutions she decided to attack me as a daughter and as a mother before screaming profanities at me and hanging upon me  We then told her she could only visit our daughter at our house  not keep her overnight or take her out without us  She would not acknowledge the conversation after and temporarily said she needed to remove herself from our lives  This was when we saw a HUGE positive change in our family structure and our daughters behavior so we decided that we wanted to continue NC instead of LC  She has since threatened to take us to court for grandparents visitation rights  but it has been a month since she was supposed to have filed and I have not been served so I am hoping that it was either just a threat or she didnt have enough of a case to take me to court  I have saved all of her texts over the past six months  as well as the voicemails she had left threatening to call the cops on us for having  our own  child with us  I also have taken pictures of all of the random gifts she has left on our porch or had mailed to us,3457,673

135,p948up,0,1,NMom compares me to other kids  despite holding me back from a lot of things growing up  There were a few instances  like just now  where she sees a video of some kid playing the violin really well and goes on to tell me   that could have been you    But she discounts the fact that she didnt want to continue to pay for lessons after one summer of classes  that was more or less  sessions    I wanted the lessons  but she always told us growing up to think that we were poor  and that we could only afford the necessities  She wanted me to teach myself instead  I was  or   I didnt have the discipline to learn everything on my own Same goes for everything else I wanted to try out when I was younger  It always felt like a burden for her spend extra on me  And again  always telling us to think that were poor  because shes a single parent   Despite that  she still overspends on groceries  buys expensive makeup  gadgets  and prioritizes travel to expensive countries at least once a year   Come to think of it  we werent poor  Shes just not good with money  She just didnt want to spend on things she didnt feel like spending on  Thats why she beat me up when I almost didnt get my financial aid scholarship in college  Thats why I was barely scraping by with my allowance  and didnt get to save up  But if you ask her  shell say that its her money  and that she can do whatever she wants with it,1428,268
136,p944s0,0,1,Emotionally Manipulative Mother Alright so long story short my dad and moms side of family dont get along  My cousin didnt invite my mom to his wedding because his dad apparently told him not to  Anyhow my grandparents are living in the same town and my cousin and his wife are in town visiting and my dad wanted me to go visit them  So my mom pretty much does not want me going to my grandparents place because they treated her like crap and my uncle said shit about her  which she found out by putting recorders in my dads car   I mean fair but that is their fight  On the other hand my dad gets pissed if I dont go  hes like youve been so brainwashed by your mom  Its a lose lose situation either way  so I figured why not just go and show them that Im not gonna resort to my familys level of pettiness that I will go out of formality and politeness  truth be told I could not give a less sh  t about anyone in my family  I would rather just live a quiet life without talking to family members  although unfortunately I decided to come home from uni for the summer to save money  and maybe there was a part of me that thought I would be able to cope with the emotional abuse of my parents  yes ik it was the wrong choice   I dont wanna be on anyones bad side so I just gotta navigate through it til I can leave in  weeks  Its just so frustrating  In the past Ive pretty much lied by omission by not telling my mom that Im going to my grandparents place  She finds out anyways somehow  She once confronted me and was like why didnt you tell me  And I was like you usually have a bad reaction when I tell you and then she was like oh so now you lie to me  who knows what else youve lied about  I mean quite a bit lmao   But then she completely denied that she had a bad reaction and was like i didnt get angry that you told me  Hooray gas lighting  So I was like ok this time I will tell her before going  she definitely had a bad reaction  She started calling me names  said ok now theyve managed to sway you to their side  my dads side  Ive definitely told her Im neutral and not taking anyones side but its like talking to a wall   like youre completely cut off from me I dont wanna talk to you ever again  and started banging her head against the wall  And honestly I just felt so disconnected emotionally and for the first time in a long time her messed up behaviour didnt bother me  If anyone it solidified my choice to go because I wanted to show her hey you cant do all this crap and then expect me to fold and do whatever you want  Like you cant control me by doing that  It was a relief because I was kind of saying screw you to mom and releasing some of her hold over me  But now shes giving me the silent treatment and Im definitely not gonna fold and apologize to her  And I quite frankly am tired of being the only one that tries with my parents  I have repeatedly told them both that if you gotta problem with me  just sit down and calmly talk it out with me and that silent treatment solves nothing   Ive been clear with my needs and wants but they dont really respect them  Its their way or no way  I also wont be coming back next summer or again unless its to visit for a long weekend or something  I am done with my parents  they either try to meet me halfway or lose me  I just wanted to vent about this and maybe get some advice as well,3393,666

148,p92c7b,0,2,My mom is obsessed with me and Im not sure how to leave her without problems Ive never really posted to Reddit before  but Im not sure where to go with this issue  NSFW because I mention sex  Im not sure if its needed  but I thought it would be best to put just in case I am  years old  and my mom continuously gets upset over me placing boundaries  Recently  she has been obsessing over my sex life  She told me she was losing sleep over thinking about it  She didnt catch me in the act of anything  she just made assumptions and thought too much about me hanging out with friends  She also stalked my bank account and figured out payments were from a  certain popular adult site   and has been accusing me of not deleting the account when I told her I did delete it  She says she can  find out  if I still have the account and was talking about hiring a private investigator to find it  The account had nothing to do with my friends  but she then accused me of being a prostitute  when I am not  A month ago she told me I needed to be given as much psychiatric medication as possible just because I enjoyed sex  Yes  that was the reason  Each sentence around that statement was regarding my sex life  so it couldnt have been for any other reason  It was all while she was yelling at me when I just got off of a night shift at work  She insisted that I shouldnt have sex ever  I had only been seeing one person the whole time and I saw them once a month  She was saying extremely paranoid things that night  claiming my ex killed children    She screamed at me to pack my shit and leave  but when I did  she screamed at me that I wasnt allowed to move out  She told me that anyone who says theyll help me will only use me and that any man that talks to me is just going to use me for sex  She insists that Ill get kidnapped for walking around during the day and looks at local missing persons almost everyday  She thinks everyone is a sex trafficker and theres no way to reason with her  She worries about pedophiles targeting me even though Im  and I do not look like a child  She tells me that Im easy to manipulate and thinks everyone I talk to has it out for me    She accused my coworkers of talking smack about me  when my coworkers are all grown adults with children She does not have any friends  she does not have a boyfriend  she doesnt even have an ex husband  She doesnt go to work  I dont know what to do for her  Ive tried talking to my colleges counseling service  but they couldnt really help me or give me advice  Every friend Ive talked to has told me to get out of my home ASAP  I wont be able to pay for college if I leave and I never had a parent who could teach me about how to actually survive in the real world because she never wanted me to leave   When I talked about adopting a kitten and taking the kitten with me when I moved out  she told me I wasnt moving out  Cats live up to  years  I would be  years old when the cat dies   I have no idea what to do or where to go or what I even can do  The way she treats me makes me feel crazy  shes always talking about how no one else has good intentions for me and how everyone is lying to me  I am dealing with my own mental issues from years of abuse and I cannot be her best friend and her therapist  Im scared to even make a second bank account to save money without her knowing because I dont want the mail to arrive to my house because she looks through my mail and packages  I really appreciate any sort of guidance or even just reassurance that Im not insane for wanting to move out  Sorry if this doesnt belong here and sorry if I added too much or explained some things too much  I left out a lot of other things shes done  I feel like this is already really long,3797,739
149,p929gs,0,2,Finally cut contact with my narcissist mother Hi all First time posting  but I need some support or advice Yesterday  my mother  younger sister and I   female  went to a water park together  The whole day  my mom would constantly bring up that I don’t talk to her much  but it’s her job as a mother to warn me about what the Bible says about my “lifestyle choices”  I’m lesbian for context   I kept telling her I didn’t want to talk about it  but she would loudly say “ok but just don’t be mad at me ”  so I felt very awkward as people started to stare at us  At one point I just said  “I don’t think the church would want someone like me ” To which she  again  loudly  said “what do you have against Christians ” She would then keep picking at my appearance  like “you know  you were prettier when your hair was longer”  “you should stop trying to be nerdy like your brother and just be yourself ”  or “you should really lose some weight”  At the end of the night  I was emotionally drained  and I felt like garbage  I talked to my best friend  and we decided that the best thing for me to do now is to cut contact with my mom  so I can finally focus on healing  I’m afraid she’s going to tell everyone how I’m such a “bad daughter” because I won’t talk to her  or that “the devil” convinced me to cut ties  I just don’t want people to think ill of me  but I need to start healing after so many years of abuse and neglect  Am I doing the right thing,1459,280
150,p926n8,0,2,Are Narcs Cruel or Delusional Nmom finally let me move out at  but she still pays for a lot of things because it makes her feel superior in control like god   Also I am a college student so I can’t work full time  I have fibromyalgia from the fear and stress that she has put me through and drilled into my head  She made me get a dietitian and tested for any micronutrient deficiencies because she was convinced I had a vitamin deficiency  She bought me epsom salt and would sometimes make baths for me But the abuse and the small jabs and cuts and the severe fear she has instilled in me has been severe in my lifetime  I’ve had psychosis twice where I’ve tried to escape and both times she would just scream at me during my panic attacks  After going to the hospital and getting psychiatric help she wouldn’t let me leave the house for a month or drive and would act like a nurse withholding meds because ‘too much lorazepam is bad for your brain’  I was having panic attacks and having to beg her for my medication  I was  Does she know the damage she has done or is she delusional  She helps pay for therapists and encourages me to go because she realizes I have anxiety but doesn’t realize it’s from her  She says I act like a moody teenager and that I’m rebelling  I have severe anxiety and ocd from the abuse  I self sabotage and am scared most of the time I’ve been trying to get out since I was  and didn’t even realize how severe and fucked up the abuse was Mom is clearly delusional but how can someone be that delusional  Damn narcs  Lol  She sees herself as a mom that has dedicated her entire life to her kids  She sees herself as savior and hero and god  It’s insane,1699,317
151,p921sn,0,8,Not Her Life’s Greatest Joy Long time lurker  first time poster   Do not steal my post…  Growing up  I was the scapegoat child   My younger sister was the Golden Child   I have been  NC with my mother for  years after being VVLC for  years My sister  the GC  previously admitted she “overdramatizes” anything bad I do and “minimizes” anything bad she does when she is angry with me because she knows our mother will be her attack dog    I am also NC with her Anyway   The reason for this   My sister  the GC  recently celebrated her birthday   My mother posted on SM the following   “Happy Birthday GC NAME   my life’s greatest joy ”Several years ago  she posted that GC was “the best daughter ever ”  💔 I know  I know   Why the hell do I look   Because I keep hoping that one day she will regret the pain she caused  I know she won’t   But no matter how much time passes  the hope is still there,910,177
152,p91w9f,0,2,The only thing keeping me going right now is imagining how good of a mom Ill be  Ill tell my kids I love them every day  because i cant remember the last time my mom told me that  Ill be happy to have them invite their friends over and let them go out to spend time with others  because my parents would never let me go anywhere without terrorizing me about it for days in advance of and after the event  Ill give them physical affection like hugs  of course only with their consent   because my mom always used to push me away  and I dont accept my dads hugs anymore because he hugs me and tells me he loves me one second  and literally throws me across the room the next  I will not have my kids feel so unhealthily needy of their friends love and affection as i feel today  because theyll be getting lots of love at home  Ill let them have sleepovers  because the first time i had one was when i was   and the morning after my parents bombarded my phone  make me leave super early while all the other kids were allowed to go to the public pool together  and yelled insults at me over the phone to the point where i broke down crying at the train station  I will earn their respect and treat them like normal human beings  because my parents always automatically expected me to respect them after all the awful things they said to me  I will acknowledge their problems and mental health and do my best to help them  because all my parents do while Im having panic attacks  which they caused  by the way  was yelling at me to shut up and not be dramatic  laugh about and mimic the way i cried  and throw a pity party about how their life is so much worse  Ill teach them how to be independent and allow them to make independent choices at all ages  to the point of letting my toddler choose their own clothes  because due to my parents sheltering and controlling i still dont know how to do basically anything on my own and highly depend on my friends at  years old  Ill give them constant reassurance  because i never got that and am needy for reassurance by everyone around me Ill talk to them in a normal tone no matter how upset they make me  because to this day i still get panic attacks from people shouting  and start shaking uncontrollably at every somewhat heated discussion  because my parents lashed out at every minor inconvenience i caused  My children will always feel like they can trust their mom with absolutely anything without fearing abuse  because all my parents taught me was how to make up lies on the spot  fearing another fight  Ill seek help for my own mental battles and not project my own feelings onto my children  because my mom always made me feel responsible for her  miserable  life  and Im always the one comforting my dad after yet another fit he threw like the manchild he is  acting like i love and understand him  even though all i want to achieve is have him calm down and stop terrorizing my mom and siblings I will recognize when my partner is being abusive  and react in an appropriate manner  because my mother failed to do that for  years now  I will not enable abusive partners and always  always put my kids first  because instead of defending me against my dad  my mom joins in to yell shit at me No matter what happens  i will throw my own feelings aside and swallow my pride when my kids are having a problem  because my parents never seemed to care about me venting about my feelings  and keep yelling insults and one upping me with their own problems I will admit my mistakes and apologize to my children for any wrongdoings on my side  because my parents feel too good for that and either laugh at me or worse when i do muster up the courage to demand an apology from them  I will make board game nights  which they wont be obliged to attend   because as long as I can remember i used to beg my parents to play games with me  which they obviously almost always declined  I will respect their privacy  because to this day my parents barge into my room without knocking and laugh at me when I ask them to I will give them space when they need it  because my parents keep guilttripping me for wanting alone time  I will keep every single thing they make  because my parents threw away my drawings from kindergarten  saying it didnt matter because they where ugly anyways  I wont get in my teenage kids business as long as they let me know theyre safe  because every somewhat nice   typically teenage  thing i did was behind my parents backs We will sit down to discuss problems  and Ill let them have their turn to tell their side of the story and express their feelings  because all my parents taught me about problem solving is yelling vile insults at each other until someone finally breaks I will keep my marriage relationship problems between my partner and I  because some of the earliest memories i have is my parents hitting each other with our kitchen chairs and me picking up and handing my dad the wedding ring my mom threw across the room when i was no older than  or   And because of the fact that she still didnt leave him I will sit them down to explain to them WHY i dont want them to do certain things  because all my parents did was demonize and make a taboo out of everything remotely bad  which only made me more curious about them I will respect their belongings  because i still get insanely uncomfortable seeing damaged toys  because my mom used to rip apart my favorite plushies and break my toys when i didnt behave  I wont allow demonization of minorities in my household  and openly talk about and explain what discrimination  bullying etc is and why its unacceptable  because my parents always tried to make me hate myself for being queer and having foreign friends I will make it clear that while school is a great tool for them to succeed later on in life  never will i make them feel like their academic successes define them  because ever since elementary school  my parents pressured me into succeeding  just so they could brag about it to their friends  I remember them telling me that me failing would ruin THEIR reputation all throughout elementary till now  While Ill show them my own morals and values  i will always reason my ways of doing things  while also letting them know that they can be whoever and however they want to be  because in the end its their own life  and Im just there to give them a good headstart and support them through everything  Because my parents teared me down for ANYTHING about me that differed from them  from wanting to adopt children rather than have biological ones  to being an atheist I will respect their career choices  because when i told my parents i wanted to be a therapist  they made fun of me whenever i showed any sign of emotional intelligence  or attempted to talk openly about how they made me feel   oh so youre trying to be a psychiatrist to us now  Go talk about that psycho shit to someone else once you even get to that point  if you even get that far   They still say  psychiatrist  even though I always corrected them to  therapist   Little things like this matter   When i then told them i wanted to be a teacher  they said similar things about how i was trying to teach them things and that i should  know my place  as the child And needless to say  no physical OR emotional abuse will ever be tolerated This got long  and it still doesnt even capture a fraction of what else i could talk about  And obviously most of these are the absolute bare minimum  and Ill do lots more  This was just a quick vent You get my point  Never  ever will my children have to feel like they have to hide ANYTHING from me  And never  ever will they feel like they have to walk on eggshells in my household  because i might lash out on them  Never  This thought is what keeps me going  and is what Im using to calm myself down in stressful situations at home  I may still be pretty young  but that doesnt keep me from practicing how Ill finally break the cycle and have my kids take a loving home for granted,8173,1477
153,p91s00,0,2,“Crying doesn’t count if I can hear you” Basically the gist of what my mom told me growing up  She has a very unhealthy view of depression and I’m assuming she sees it in a “Hollywood” way where it only “counts” if you actively try to conceal it  My older sister fell sick with an eating disorder in her teens  and from that point forward my mom  covert narc  became overprotective of my sister and did anything and everything it took to make my sister’s life easier  It made this weird phenomenon happen where my mom decided I was “stronger” and “tougher” than my sister  I was four years younger  and I often had to give up things to make my sister happy  and just generally carry the emotional load  take care of my sister and protect her  Some family members started emotionally abusing me at the time  and my mom admitted a few years later that she never did anything about it because she was afraid if she protected me  they would go after my sister  I developed an eating disorder too  but over eating  not under eating  so my mom was largely unconcerned because she thinks it’s only a problem if you’re too thin and too depressed to eat Anyway  my sister tried to conceal most of her problems and hide her depression throughout that time  which made my mom obsessive with helping her  to the point of too strongly involving herself in my sister’s privacy  and also forcing her to go to therapy kicking and screaming  My sister is a grown adult now  much recovered  who my mom still thinks is too weak to function in this world  However  when I started developing all  my  problems as a teen  I could just never seem to get my mom’s attention for it  I wanted to be helped like my sister was  Instead  for example  my mom once caught me hurting myself  but she just got angry  screamed at me  and grounded me for it  Every moment of acting out just seemed to aggravate and annoy my mom further  but not make her worry about me  I suspect it’s because I was very outspoken that I needed help  which didn’t work in my mom’s book  because you have to not want people to know you’re depressed if you’re actually depressed  I had to beg to be taken to therapy  The title of this post happened when I was crying one night for over an hour after bedtime  and my mom pounded on my door and told me to shut up and that I was only doing it for attention  I tried to tell her I wasn’t  but she replied that she used to cry into her pillow as a teenager  but she did it so softly that no one could hear  because that’s what it actually means to be depressed  She could hear me  so it meant I didn’t actually need help  To this day  I still have imposter syndrome towards my own feelings  P S  Nothing against my sister  I’m glad she got help and I genuinely think she needed it more  I only resent my mom for how she handled our situations,2849,533
154,p91kvq,0,10,I wish I didnt have a father than to have an abusive one  Hes an alcoholic for starters   so for the first days I can recall of my childhood  the event of him abusing my sister and nearly blinding her with his fist shook me  he used to beat me too for no reason but I always thought its okay Some other things include him pulling up a weapon on our cat   for more context  the cat could go in and out of the house from the windows and then one night it annoyed him to the point where he went to pick and charge his rifle and started looking for it to shoot  Having all this happened as I was young affected me in many ways He also never stood up for me  once I broke down crying in front of him   for personal   family  conflict   I was older this time   he just walked past me and didnt care  I witnessed him cheat on my mother on several occasions  even while once she was in a surgery  He treats his friends better than all of us  and only cares about himself  When he cooks something  its sure as hell he wont give you some He is also bipolar and so hypocrite because he says he wants one thing  then the very next minute can argue and yell against that very thing and that very thing has caused enough problems There are just so many other things   big or small actions but I feel like not saying it all because its exhausting to think off I always was willing to forget about the past and tried to get close to him  wanted something as simple as a call or a how are you  let alone hear i love you he didnt even know what levels of study I was at  he probably doesnt keep count now too I always looked for him in other people  but I think its a hole in my heart that cant be filled by anyone I guess  Its a broken glass that cant be fixed Thank you for reading this  it has been forever in my heart Ps  Im a girl,1838,366
155,p91im0,0,6,Why do parents think that creating a child means they can treat it how they like  Vent This is kind of general but I feel like npd particularly in parents might be an extreme of a general attitude of parents who have kids and feel they can do as they please because they brought you into this world keep a roof over your head   do the bare minimum  This is probably obvious but  Like why does everyone want to protect parents  Why aren’t parents held accountable  Unless you had a gun to your head like nobody forced you to have children  and even if there were a set of complicated factors that forced you into that situation I feel like in a lot of cases this can still be considered abusive and selfish to say the least  Yes mum  you did make sacrifices  And mistakes  I asked for neither  In fact  I didn’t even ask to be born  so chew on that after your only child stops talking to you,891,170

162,p90khn,0,5,narcissism or “peter pan syndrome”  note  i have a question but i wasn’t expecting to vent so much  so i’m using the rant vent flair  if this goes against a policy i missed while reading the rules i apologize    hello all  i’ve been a lurker on this sub for a long time  i’m F and i’ve had suspicions that my mother is a narcissist  i’m not a professional or anything and i don’t intend to diagnose her my mother has been single for most of my life  after my step dad split when i was around   she dated for a while but now i think she’s finished with the dating scene i am not an only child but i have a large age difference with my sibling so i consider my experience to be similar  i have been anxious for most of my life  my mother is a very high strung person  she is incredibly sensitive and defensive and does not do well in times of stress  i have always been the one cleaning up her messes  apologizing to store clerks after her public freak outs  trying my best to cool her down in the aftermath  and so on  my mother has said she doesn’t know what she’d do without me  she says it almost every day  it leaves me feeling almost paralyzed in living my own life  people ask what i’m doing with my life  or what i want to do…  and i just don’t know  i make things up on the spot just to keep the conversation flowing  because how do i explain that i have no drive to live my own life because i’ve lived most of it picking up my mother’s pieces  i’m fucking exhausted and i haven’t even really lived yet anyway  i would argue my mother is pretty smart  or at least somewhat intelligent  she has some interests that are intellectual and mature and she’s very knowledgeable when it comes to certain topics  however… she does this thing where she will sometimes sound like a child for no reason  it’s hard for me to even explain  but like  she will randomly put on the voice of a little kid  it could be for anything  at any time and anywhere  she will have a blank stare when i say something simple and respond like a child  it’s embarrassing when we’re in public and she suddenly starts acting like this but it’s mostly harmless and doesn’t last long  other times she will have full on tantrums and will scream and holler over small inconveniences  it’s impossible for me to get through to her when she’s like this  and if i do  it’s usually her just saying whatever it takes to shut me up  “yeah you’re right ” “ok i understand  stop yelling at me ” etcmy question  is there more to this that i’m missing  do these traits sound similar to those of true narcissists  or does she sound more like an adult with peter pan syndrome  is there much overlap here  fwiw  my mother does show signs of empathy  and it seems genuine to me but i’m not sure i can even trust my own judgment  she is generous to people on the street  amp  neighbors  she cries at sad movies  etc  idk  i know i’m rambling here but any insight is appreciated TLDR  can someone exhibit traits of both NPD and peter pan syndrome  how can you differentiate between the two disorders,3069,569

164,p9029s,0,2,Does anyone deal with parentification as well when it comes to their narcissistic parents  This is something I am discovering recently with my nmom  She fosters children and after she adopted me she began to like hardcore make me coparent with her but constantly says that I am not responsible when I bring up the pressure that shes putting me under  Also so for a bit more background I live with her and I am still actively trying to move out  And she consistently puts up roadblocks for me as well,500,91
165,p901so,0,6,Today for the first time I have not regressed  I dont care what it cost  I do not have to do it  I am not the one who is wrong  The gray rock has not turned out well  My mother has punished me without going out for  ignoring  her  that is  not telling her about my problems or what I do with my friends  Not engaging in conversations with them  And just saying good night when I get home after leaving   So according to her she has had enough and this will not continue  and although she has not taken the phone from me yet  she has said that she will  When she realizes Im not going to change she will getting worse  I dont have to tell her anything  She does not deserve it  And she will use the information against me  I made the mistake of told her that I drink alcohol in a party  And now  she said that I am a alcohol adict  which Im not  Even I dont like the taste so I dont drink to much   and that I smoke weed  I never told her anything like that   lmao So  now  I wont say anything to her anymore She says Im spiteful because I reminded her that she tried to choke me a few months ago  And that I am the aggressive one to defend myself  lmaooooooo  And when I made a post about this  many warned me that it could get worse  it hasnt  However  she said  In the end we will have to come to blows  Implicitly implying that something like this could happen again  I dont think it will happen  because social services warned her that they could send me to a juvenile center  Nmom  Im not giving in and you can throw all the tantrums or punishments you want  I am not doing anything wrong  it is not my fault nor am I the one causing all this  I will not fall into Gaslighting again  Even in this situation  I feel very powerful knowing that she cant control my behaviour Every  verbal  fight  every provocation or innuendo makes it clearer for me to go to NC and let it rot by itself,1922,369
166,p9006n,0,6,Anyone else trying to heal their relationship to parenthood  My whole life  my grandmother has told me that me being born basically ruined my mother’s life  and  of course  hers   She told me that being pregnant almost killed my mother  that if it wasn’t for me she never would have developed a brain tumor  she would have been able to hold down a job  she would have stayed with my father  she wouldn’t be dependent on my grandmother  etc  Logically  I know this is all bullshit  My mother has never once made me feel like I was responsible for any of the things my grandmother claimed I was  Even when she talks about having to take a semester off from college because her pregnancy was hard on her  She takes every opportunity to tell me that I’m her whole world  and that none of those things are even close to being my fault  My mother was born with a neurological disability  My grandmother has spent her whole life perpetuating ableist rhetoric that my mother’s illness and subsequent comorbidities  dyslexia  anxiety depression  chronic fatigue  weight gain  weak immune system  etc   are a moral failing  and that if my mother would just listen to her and do what she says then she’d be “hEaLtHiEr ThAn A nOrMaL pErSoN ” This  in addition to saying that me being born did nothing but make her life infinitely harder So  because of this  my grandmother impressed on me that I should never have children  She insisted I do penance for the sin I committed by being born by never having children  lest I risk repeating my mother’s mistakes  Subconsciously  I’ve actively avoided anything related to babies or children or parenthood because the first comment out of my grandmother’s mouth would be  “YOU’RE not going to have children anytime SOON  are you ” Before going on a tirade about everything I’ve already mentioned  It went so far that when I had to start taking birth control at   on a low  not enough to prevent pregnancy dosage  to treat my own chronic illness  my grandmother was convinced that I was lying and that I was intentionally asking for a low dosage so I could wind up pregnant  Even when I went to college  she would interrogate me about whether or not I was dating so she could catch me lying about being sexually active  It’s only now at almost  that I’m trying to be comfortable about the fact that  at some point in my life  I want to get married and have kids  Maybe not a bunch  but at least one  It’s a discomfort I had only just realized  My friend asked me  “Why do you always say ‘if’ you get married or have kids  I think you’d be a great mom ” That I actually stood back and thought about it Is this just me or have other people had similar journeys,2701,478

169,p8zovf,0,7,I just googled myself I went NC with nDad a few months ago  I have flashes of guilt because I ghosted him  I blocked him on  phone and gmail but his messages go to my spam folder and I made the mistake of checking it  His last message was about a month ago saying  Im sorry for everything   He doesnt apologize ever  but I didnt respond because I dont believe he is sincere  I was feeling a bit guilty for not responding but then I realized   he has my home address  he could write me a letter  I googled myself and multiple top hits were related to my job WITH my work contact info  So yeah  stop feeling guilty about blocking them  Theyre not trying that hard to get back in touch,690,134
170,p8zkbu,0,11,Tips for No Contact with nMom   Hello  The title really gets to the point  but if a little explaining helps feel free to keep reading  Essentially Im just looking for tips or advice on no contact  I feel like Ive been at the edge of no contact so many times and failed by giving in to quickly  But every time I do  the next flare up is x worse I want to go no contact with my mom  I want to really pull the trigger this time  I could probably write forever about every incident  but I wont  Ill just explain what feels like the final straw this time My mom has always had a problem with me making friends or relationships outside of my parents and brother  and to be honest  she doesnt like me having relationships with my dad or brother either   Always finding reasons someone wasnt good enough for me or convincing me Im better off with just her and that our circle  more like a line with only two points   me and her  is the only thing that matters in life  Fast forward to when I turned  and got the hell out of dodge and met my present day husband  He is amazing  My husband accepted my moms crazy tendencies and comforted supported me throughout everything  However  I can tell it definitely wears even him down  How could it not In my moms usual fashion  she of course of the years tried saying things to convince me I should leave him  Anything from nitpicking his career choice  that he has two sons  now my step sons   hes too calm to straight up fabricating lies  Shes tried to convince me that she thinks he is cheating on me  doesnt love me or worst of all  she tried telling me she thinks that he is abusing our son  we have one child together on top of his two sons from a previous relationship   None of which she had any basis for  Just her suspicion or gut feeling  On top of all that  she constantly flirts with him by feeling his muscles and trying to touch him or a few Thanksgivings ago she even got drunk and took her shirt off in front of him in the other room claiming it to be an accident  my husband immediately told me within seconds of it happening   Obviously  my mom has issues About  months ago she fabricated something new  told me that she thinks my husband is sexually assaulting our son  All because he had a rash on his bum when she was babysitting  I told her that is a very extreme accusation to make and that our  year old has been backtracking a bit with potty training  specifically    and sometimes he goes only a little bit and doesnt tell us  causing slight rashes   I told her I would not be having this conversation again and that I didnt want to hear her accusing my husband of something so horrible with no real basis  I know my husband and he wouldnt even hurt a fly She dropped the topic for awhile  but still pushed her luck by trying to bring it up  more times  my fault I know  I should have told her enough is enough sooner   Finally she brought it up again a couple nights ago  along with how she feels like I dont love her or spend enough time with her   which is intentional as I was trying to go low contact   I basically said this is too much and that I dont want to have a relationship with her anymore  I cant keep listening to her fabrications and having   hours arguments on the phone   times a day  She literally takes up my whole life for days when she gets like this to the point that I just give in and try to smooth it over so I can move on and get back to focusing on work and my own household  She tried putting my dad on the phone to convince me I was wrong  her go to tap in move when she feels like she is losing power   but I simply told him its late and I have kids still awake because Ive been neglecting them for this argument and Im done  The next day she called and I ignored it because I was working  she doesnt understand the concept because she doesnt work and hasnt for decades   It felt so good to not pick up  Usually I always pick up because if I dont I have to hear her say What if I was dying  I knew you didnt love me  and it always ensues an argument  When I didnt pick up  she immediately flooded my phone with text messages  Most of which I truly couldnt understand because she was just all over the place with her topics  But it felt like she was trying to back track and in a weird round about way  apologize somehow  I only sent one text back letting her know I was working and that this wasnt a conversation to be easily had while doing so  Plus  it was open house night at school for my step sons and I wanted to be there for it  I texted her back at some point in the evening letting her know that I just dont want to have a close relationship with her and that she cant respect boundaries  She asked if she could still see my son  her only biological grandkid  and I told her I wouldnt keep him from her  My mom then said fine and to let her know from now on every Sunday evening via text when are good days times to see him  Yeah  of course she had to find a way to control that too  I didnt care though if it meant creating the necessary distance However  she keeps trying to push the envelope and I know she is trying to open a conversation with me again  right now Im just being very dry and to the point and not talking unless necessary   She keeps trying to text and ask if my step sons want to hang out with her  which she never cared about until recently  or request to talk on the phone to my son more than she normally would   its literally been  days since I told her I dont want a relationship I know this was already a lot without me even going down every avenue  so thank you if you made it this far  Again  Im just looking for advice for how to go no contact because I feel like Im close and I know its going to be a long process but I really dont want to back track now and have to start over  But I can feel her trying to be submissive and feel things out  I know she is waiting for a good moment to have the next blow up and get me to break down  Her birthday is next week and then its my sons birthday in  weeks  I know she will want to try and fix things in time for that and if Im honest Im not sure how to avoid letting her come to my sons birthday   but Im also scared for how shell act because she doesnt mind making a scene in front of others Im incredibly anxious to pull the trigger on no contact  I keep walking around my house making sure all the windows and doors are locked and cameras are working because she has broken in to my house in the past to start a fight when I ignored her before  I shouldnt be scared of my own mom  but I am  I know last time I should have called the police and filed a restraining order  I wish I did  but it all just took me by surprise  If she ever does it again I will be more prepared mentally  but it still scares me a bit Any advice is greatly appreciated  Thank you,6928,1339
171,p8zgul,0,2,One of my first clear memories I have of my nDad was him invalidating me  I was  years old  amp  my dad was having me blow my nose into a tissue  a tissue that he had literally just used to blow his own nose   I remember him using the tissue on me  feeling his mucus that was already on the tissue get on my face  being disgusted   amp  speaking up to him saying that I didnt want to use that tissue because he was getting his snot on my face with it    He then quickly replied something to the effect of  The same snot that is in me is in you    amp  then continued wiping his snot rag on my face  in spite of my objection    What the hell does that even mean  We share a significant amount of the same DNA  so my natural aversion to not have his snot touching my face was therefore invalid    Really  what this displayed was an early indicator of his complete lack of distinction between where he ended  amp  I began  or regard for my own personal autonomy   to any degree    I wouldnt even want to re use a tissue that had my own mucus on it  My little voiced concern was COMPETELY justified  but not to nDad    The idea of me speaking up  amp  saying that I didnt want his snot touching my face was silly  amp  could rightly just be disregarded because  well  I AM HIM   in his mind   My snot  his snot   whats the difference   I was just an extenstion of him  not an individual little person with their own feelings   This might seem a little trivial  but this is one of the clearest early memories I have of my nDad   amp  it really set the tone for many of the experiences I had to deal with going forward     no right to set any boundaries  no right to any personal autonomy  nothing valid to say that went against anything he was doing  amp  or wanted to do that involved me,1816,354
172,p8z3ju,0,4,Trying to forgive my parents but I have undiagnosed disorders from childhood and they blame them on me as an adult  triggering negative cycles  tw  everything tbh  so    i’m not sure where to even start but as a quick run through  i was raised upper middle class and my mother and father were separated  years before she passed away when i was   neither of them knew that i was being sexually abused since around age  and i was always quiet and showed symptoms of autism and adhd  after my mom passed my dad moved us out of the house and remarried  i went from having two bedrooms to myself  to sleeping on a futon in the game room  my dad then accepted a job out of town so i was essentially being raised by my step mom and he would come back on weekends  i was a daddy’s girl but by time this shift happened  whenever he did come home he treated me like i was ugly and belittled me and most of my genuine interests  this caused me to become even more closed off and mean so i tried to stay to myself  they would then call me lazy and say i didn’t care about anything when it was clear signs of depression and adhd  they ignored the signs and i was secretly suicidal and self harming middle school through high school  in   in college  i was sexually assaulted by my best friend  was being abused by all organizations i was in  was drugged at a party and had a suicide attempt in the same night  and had a very public fall of reputation    but at the same time i was undergoing a spiritual awakening that essentially showed me my worth and saved me  i’ve tried to do my best since then and i have healed my self esteem and other areas of my life but it’s clear that i now strongly show every symptom of borderline personality disorder  ptsd  adhd  and could’ve been born with mild autism   my parents cut me off at the beginning of the pandemic and only swoop in if my situation is damaging to their reputation  i’m inbetween housing right now and was fighting everyday to be optimistic  just to go to my dads bday party last weekend where they revealed they bought the large lake house across the street from their  bed home  this completely triggered a public meltdown from me and i’m ashamed that i did so much inner healing just to come home and crack  realizing all my adult and childhood emotional needs have been neglected  because of my reaction  my parents are now offering to pay for therapy but at the same time my dad is saying that i’m making things up  i’m trying to make myself sick  and it’s not his problem bc i’m an adult now and my  also emotionally neglected  siblings aren’t having the same issues  though i will take their help with therapy i feel like there’s no way i can operate around them because they won’t admit to neglecting me and even now  the solutions are very shallow  i want to be in their lives but i know they will continue to disregard me emotionally and it’s so painful  i forgive them for how they are yet i’m completely blamed for my feelings that stem from childhood  because of my spirituality  i know   i can become the adult i want to be and am actively working towards it despite my past     i just truly don’t know how to move forward within this family and help them understand me from the lenses of undiagnosed mental disorders that should’ve been evaluated when i was a child  i am getting psychiatric testing next week   at this point everyone is turning against me and becoming even more unwilling to help as the days pass because they think my emotional reactions are ridiculous  which is why i’m trying to get diagnosis so they would be more willing to hear me  my inner child is broken and i’m healing her and my stability issues but it’s hard when i’m considered to be at fault for things well beyond my control  all i want is for my parents to hear me with understanding so we can move forward and heal together but instead i’m being treated as the insane black sheep of the family even though i’m actively seeking help and want to grow past my codependency issues  i’m happy by myself and with my friends who love me despite my flaws so i know i can be okay without having my family in my life considering the shallow care and support they show hurts me almost every time i see them  overall  honestly  does this sound like a lost cause that i need to move forward from alone  and if not  what more can i do,4381,821
173,p8z3ca,0,2,Breakups are already hard enough  Allow me to take you back to the crisp days of Winter    I was a teenager  the boy I dated for  years and gave my virginity to cheated on me  For months and months afterward he gaslit me about it  until I actually apologized for being crazy  That year I got to stay an extra week with my Nana after a family vacation  I had so much self esteem pumped into me during that visit that I was finally able to break up with him Such hell was waiting for me when I got home That rat fucking bastard told my parents I was mean to him when I left him  and even told them that we had been fucking  They hid that they knew until I got back so they could ambush me  First it was lectures about how unacceptable it was to be mean to him  How they never ‘taught me to behave like that ’ Then we moved on into the lectures about how ashamed they were of me and how now they needed to ‘get me tested for stds and pregnancy’  lol never fucking happened  they never cared about my body  just shaming me  Over the next months my parents kept driving him to church with us  and having him over to the house without ever checking to see if I was okay with it  When I expressed to my dad how uncomfortable that made me  he decided to tell me how hard the breakup was ON HIM because it reminded him of his parents divorce  Very appropriate guilt to lay on the doorstep of your self harming teenage daughter They remained close to him well after they kicked me out  only keeping their distance after it became apparent he was emotionally abusing the teenager he married in his s I just don’t get how someone could do that to their own daughter  My dad had this fantasy that on my first date he would greet my partner while cleaning his gun  When I was a kid I thought I meant he wanted to show the boy that I was protected and cared about  now I know it was more about making my father feel like the cop he never was,1946,375
174,p8yy8a,0,2,I recently remembered a childhood acquaintance who had extremely oppressive Nparents  and he was possibly on the road to psychopathy because of them  When I was in elementary school  I was friendly  but not super close with  an ostensibly kind of unstable kid  Lets call him James  James frequently argued with teachers  got into fights  both in school and during extracurricular activities  would throw sports equipment and storm out of the gym if he was on the losing side of a game in PE class  His longest streak of not getting sent to the principals office for something was only  weeks  if I remember right  The dude could not manage his feelings whatsoever Well  if you saw the inner workings of the household James came from  it would not be difficult to figure out why  His parents were blatantly  overtly over controlling of him   of the time  They didnt even give the shits necessary to put on a mask for guests  One of his younger sibling had broken a toy of his that he was never given a replacement for  on the grounds of some kind of group punishment  They refused to help him with homework  He wasnt allowed to show emotion of any kind  One time  I was over at his house  and we werent allowed to go inside for anything other than to use the bathroom  because his parents determined that he had spent enough time playing inside already for the day  Thats all I did get to see  cant imagine what else he was subjected to behind closed doors By the time middle school started  we split paths  I stayed in public  and James parents enrolled him at a private school  because they sincerely believed that his bad behavior was the product of negative influences from other students  even though no one else in school had a record anywhere near as decorated  if you will  as his was  I never saw him in person again  but there were frequent rumors from other graduates of my elementary school about what trouble James got into in any given week  mostly more fights  There wasnt proof of any of it  and Id kind of moved on  so I didnt think much of it  Then high school rolled around  and I caught news of James that I could not ignore Middle of my freshman year of high school  the word on the street was that James had been caught attempting murder  This wasnt just hearsay  there were local news headlines corroborating it  He had a kitchen knife in his possession at school  and was very close to using it on one of his peers  only being stopped by several other students tackling him  Apparently  the almost victims family dropped charges  Whether a correctional institution actually would have fixed this guys temperament is anyones guess  A quick glance through his Facebook profile told me that he now works as a middle school teacher  and either is in deep denial about  or doesnt remember how awful his rearing was  several posts saying how his parents are the greatest ever can be found   May god have mercy on his pupils Just makes me that much more grateful to have this community and other tools to stay self aware and avoid emulating my parents,3096,544
175,p8ytnj,0,7,I had a breakthrough in therapy today about my parents at  years old  Yup   I just had my first breakthrough in therapy at  years old  I have abandonment issues I never thought I did  because my mom is verbally overbearing  She has called me her best friend  freaks out over potential illness  shes a  healer  by trade   is constantly looking for sympathy etc  but at many key junctions throughout my life  she physically wasnt there For example   and probably the most impactful  when I was   I moved to live in a commune  with my mom     except she never came too  For two years  I thought I was living my best life as a self sufficient  year old without oversight or punishment  but really   I was pretty alone  Did I want to do it at the time  Yeah  But   I was   Without parents  She never took responsibility until way later in my life  when shed call me crying about how sad she is about everything  and I was confused about it until now I lived in a house by myself on  acres with multiple groups of people that all took care of the property  did weird shit like hosted drum circles  grew and sold pot  and ate communal style  I walked to the bus to go to school  and my dad would drive two hours or so for school meetings every once in awhile  I could go whole days at a time without seeing an adult though  and was able to freely go and do what I wanted   which  for the most part  meant I wandered into the forest and hung out with animals 😂I think this fear of abandonment has played into a lot of things in my life  Ive become overly stable in adulthood just trying to find footing  I also constantly feel like a burden  Im not sure of myself  I feel the need to  buy  peoples love  I feel genuinely better alone  Doing crafts or creating things  Not with people  Anyway  not looking for solutions here  just venting what has been weighing on me lately to the group that probably gets it the most  😭,1941,355
176,p8yt42,0,11,My mother trying to weasel her way back after telling me to never talk to her again after a fight that resulted from her being more  important  I  f  havent talked to my mom in  weeks since I got back from being out of state for the death of my father  She picked a fight about her feelings being more important than the death of my dad  The fight got pretty heated and my teenage son intervened  which pissed his grandmother off even more  After getting after my son to drop it and get in the car  she told me to never talk or see her again  Well  we have been friends on facebook since facebook was around and I thought of unfriending her  but that would make the situation worse  so Ive just ignored her on facebook  But Last night she tagged me and  other women in a recent picture she took with my cat when she was taking care of my cat while I was out of state when my dad was dying   I ignored the post but cant help but feel that shes using this as a tactic to try to get my attention to talk to her I have too much stress right now to deal with my moms pettiness and as of yesterday Im on a holter monitor for  weeks because Ive been having heart problems for a year  with abnormal ECGs  and have to take a stress test and echo cardiogram next week  My teenager is starting school next week and I fear he will get covid or well both get covid and Ill die because of whatever heart issue I have   So I have a lot of anxiety and dont know how Im supposed to process it all  The grief from losing my dad is proving to be more difficult than I ever imagined grief would feel like I did add my mom to the restricted list so she cant view any posts unless theyre public and most recently  changed all past posts to friends only so she cant view anything on my profile  I dont want to punish her  but Im tired of this tactic she uses on me and my son because shes angry she didnt get her way,1925,379

180,p8ygcw,0,8,Need advice for silent treatment So earlier this week  my family helped me move in to med school  I was so excited and this was a dream Ive been looking forward to for all my life  My family was happy for me as well  As we were driving around  I noticed a pizza place next to my apartment  I got excited because I love pizza and was  jokingly  talking about how I was going to eat there every day  What happened next was that my mom went  youre going to look like a pig  in a tone that felt a little mean to me  That was really triggering for me  I have been feeling very uncomfortable with my body lately because Ive gained weight  and she loves to point it out  I was so happy in that moment  having moved in and ready to start my new life  and her words just ruined the mood  I was really hurt and I calmly said  hey mom can you please not compare me to a pig   She then got really defensive and said she didnt mean it  and that she didnt know it was bad to compare people to pigs  such a lie   I didnt want a confrontation so I just said  okay fine you didnt mean it  but I was fighting back tears because I was hurt  She then got really mad at me and she hasnt talked to me in a week  Her demeanor immediately became icy and cold  She is essentially waiting for me to reach out and apologize  but I have nothing to apologize for  Generally  I dont really reach out to her  due to our countless fights and the harm she has caused to me in the past  I feel like I cant talk about anything without starting a fight  So Ive pretty much backed off and she is the one that usually reaches out to me  The fact that she hasnt said anything shows me that she is giving me the silent treatment  but I know that if I mention it to her  shell flip it around and tell me that Im giving her the silent treatment instead  Im also bummed because I just wanted these weeks to be good between us because I have achieved a goal that I have literally poured every inch of my soul into  Does anyone have advice about how you would approach this situation,2059,404

183,p8y2kg,0,2,Emotional  physical and mental abuse Since I was about  I slowly started to realize how abusive my father is and how complacent my mother is  He controls every task she does and all his of needs are met first  only his opinion matters  and if you don’t agree  prepare yourself  Once when I was on video chat with my friend and my dad was verbally abusing me  without realizing she was listening and watching  he gave me a bloody nose and busted lip  She called the police and when they showed up to my house both of my parents were distraught that I called them  The police looked at my house  looked at all the materialistic items we had and told me to be grateful I had a family like the one the saw in those ten minutes  And they left  I had no phone  internet or television for  months  I only had myself and a journal  I was so disassociated for those months  My mother never came to check on me  I was only allowed to stay in my room and go out to eat when everyone else was done  This all happened when I was   Now at   finishing school soon  I have never felt more desperate to leave and never look back  I’m trying to take advantage as much as I can that I can stay here for free and just do my best in school but part of me just wants to drop out and move far away and never speak to them again  I walk around this house with my heart in my throat and biting my tongue until it bleeds  I’m embarrassed when my dad has his outbursts towards me in front of my partner  He is a toxic patriarch and no one can stop him and no one can help me except for myself  I have many stories and instances of abuse that I can recall and I’ve always wanted to write a blog or journal about them and how I “coped”  I think writing them out will be the closest thing to therapy for me  At least for now,1810,359
184,p8xysq,0,2,Being raised by Indian parents Since I was  they have constantly belittled me  bully me  abuse me physically and verbally  blame me for their mistakes  When I was a kid I wasn’t treated like a kid  I was treated like a college student  always being told to study constantly which would make me unhappy because my cousins and friends would be playing and I’d be here studying for no reason  I was in grade   That shit doesn’t even matter  I was always compared to my cousins and other people’s kids  Instead of being proud of me when I got really good grades on tests and exams they would briefly appraise it but then suddenly compare me to another kid they know and tell me that he got better marks than you  This would make me feel like shit and worthless Everything was my fault  Helping dad fix something and can’t do something right because I don’t know to use a tool  My fault  Lost something valuable to them  My fault  Can’t do something perfectly while I’m learning  My fault  On top of all that  I was the punching bag  the scapegoat of my friend group  Because of this I started to develop anxiety and major depression  I would avoid social gatherings because I was afraid of being judged and bullied  I would sleep for hours  be unmotivated  wouldn’t help anyone because I was always tired  When I got to college I developed OCD and it would highly impact my life and daily tasks  When I confronted my parents about this in  they said I was lying  that I was making excuses  that it’s all in my head  I’ve been put on antidepressants and antipsychotics ever since They keep urging me to stop taking my meds because “it’s bad for me” when they are the only thing that keeps me sane  If I miss a dose or stop taking them it makes me very depressed againMy first suicide attempt was in December of  because of the immense pressure my parents were putting on me to finish school  Since then  they have guilt tripped me and still refuse to believe my mental health disorders  They keep making excuses that it’s all in my head  that only I have control over it  and them being extremely religious  which is the main cause of my OCD  always tell me to believe in god and all of this will go away  blah blah blah  Since December  I have attempted  more times and have been admitted to psych wards  Don’t get me wrong  they said they care about me and to never attempt again and to be open with them  So when I told them everything that they were the cause of my mental disorders  they of course  told me that they were saints while raising me as a kid while refusing to acknowledge the toxic traits and behaviours they acted out against me  Anyways I have nobody to blame except my parents and toxic friends I have had to deal with for all of my mental disorders  It just sucks that the people you put your trust in refuse to believe your mental health and think of you as an investment rather than their kid,2942,543
185,p8xxsq,0,3,My little brother is narcissistic and very secretive Out of my other narcissistic family members this worries me most  Basically  Im not too much older than my younger bro and since we were little Ive tried to involve him in things I would do  When we moved to a different country and he came into my school in later years I would take him with me to school everyday and try to talk with him when he was in his awkward antisocial phase  unlike my older brother that essentially used to ignore me in boarding school cuz I guess he didnt want to be associated with his lil bro   because I know how it felt When I left to go to uni in London I would take him with me to concerts and he’d stay at mine  However  now that he is at uni and has a good friendship group he’s started looking down on me and I think this is also because of my place in the family  We haven’t argued or anything like that  I dont have the strength to do so with any of my family members anymore especially after a lifelong cucle of abuse  But  he goes out of his way to disrespect me even when it is not neccessary  I fell out with my friendship group before graduation  so Ive spent this summer by myself for the most part and he doesnt even attempt to gist me about where he goes etc  Another example is he recently started a new account on Facebook and followed everyone in my family except from me and then when I was talking about fb around him he immediately changed his behaviour This reslly feels like a last straw because my other siblings and my mum are really toxic  And Ive honestly given up on human relationships to be honest  Normal me is really friendly and outgoing but the way my siblings especially have treated me during a difficult period in my life  when I supported them when they had theyre own  is very eye opening to me   Im planning to take a year out from my masters and go abroad but I havent told any of my family yet because honestly I dont feel like they have my best interest at heart  like at all  My mum goes out of her way to instill shame in me  everything with my sister is always all about her  my brother is just selfish idk if it has anything to do with being the oldest son and now my younger brother is very fake to my face  Lately Ive realised that in my family  noone wants a genuine connection with me or each other and have resorted to use competition as a substitute to communication Just posting this as I would like some advice on how to proceed with the situation  as Ive been very calm even when provoked and mostly stay on my own now but I cant see that lasting in the future,2608,501

195,p8wtdt,0,4,Long story  but somewhat wholesome if you have the time to read I have a lot of memories from childhood that I locked away  I felt a lot of shame for who I was at just  year old  But even with my limited vocabulary at that age  I would tell my abusers that they were being mean to me  It was a word I learned in school about bullies  the irony   I would openly confront their behavior as mean  Because I was taught in school that you stand up to bullies and tell them what they’re doing is mean and hurtful  That it’s supposed to take their power away if you bravely confront them with the truth  Imagine a  year old me  fearlessly calling out her abusers with all that conviction  bravery and anger  I wish I had that courage now lol  Sometimes I imagine the girl I would’ve been if they didn’t take the time to break my spirit  Once upon a time  I was brave  And I learned how to be brave As usual  they turned it against me  Anytime I confronted them  they would mock or punish me for it  “Always the same word  mean  Maybe you’re the mean one for saying it  Why do you say it like that  If you say mean one more time  Here we go again  calling us mean  That’s the only word she knows ”  Even as a write this I feel that old guilt for likening my parents with school bullies  How dare I  So ungrateful  But they were much worse than any bully  It was easier to believe because all three of them would laugh and gang up on me  Gone was the brave little  year old  But I like to think of her fondly  She knew she was outnumbered and it didn’t scare her to try anyways  I can still remember her anger and the way she prepared to confront them  Big scowl on her face  hands on her hip  chest puffed out for good measure  standing in the middle of the kitchen  all of some  and   feet tall  choosing to forget the fear she felt  and loudly saying  “Hey  You’re being mean ” She knew how to set boundaries and she knew the standard of treatment she deserved  She’s my hero  And I would’ve forgotten about her if that memory didn’t unlock this morning  The look on their face was priceless before they attacked her  Yea  she’s my hero,2157,414
196,p8wsb6,0,2,Is enmeshment always narcissm  Men who have been enmeshed by their mothers  would you say this is always narcissm or can a toxic environment lead to it Personally my mother lost her first her husband  my father  and developed a drinking problem and very few boundaries especially with me growing up and would vent to me about her new husband and even share intimate details and issues  she was also very controlling and over protective of me  Usually this would happen when she would binge drink by herself on the weekends in the living room and wanted company  She would also be very volatile and would be constantly angry cleaning and raging  Would verbally berate me and call me things like useless idiot etc when I would make mistakes or do something that made her mad  She sometimes hit me with whatever she had close by like a broom stick or would pull my hair and I would hear my scalp pop It seems she would be nicer to me when she was mad at her husband and meaner to me when she was good with him  Sometimes it was a weird dynamic where she would defend me a lot from the step dad and wouldnt let him try to  discipline  me  Mind you I never disrespected him even though he always had a disrespectful vibe towards me and jealousy from the enmeshment  I was also asked to help parent my siblings to compensate for what she felt were her husbands short comings in that aspect Ive moved out after step dad disrespected me and my gf after he was caught on a dating app talking to women in other countries  Im confused because Mom has her good moments and seems to have empathy towards me and others and apologized for her past behaviors when I told her how I feel about it  However she can be very irrational and has a hard time even understanding the concept of boundaries without getting offended if I set one  My younger half siblings also have a hard time understanding boundaries  Whenever I have to set a boundary to a toxic behavior from any of them they all get offended and start to attack me as one  They are not happy that I do not visit them at home because step dad apologized to me for what he did  All I ask of them as that we spend time in a neutral place,2188,407

203,p8vur5,0,6,Getting out of an abusive household  Hi all I posted this in r justnofamily as well but thought I would cross post here since it seems relevant  Sorry in advance for the long post but I am looking for advice from any of you who have broken away from abusive family situations at an older age I am a  year old still living in my abusive parents home  The abuse is not physical nor has it ever been  but it is tumultuous and is very ingrained in me as I have lived in this situation for virtually my entire life  I have a decent enough job  a bachelors degree in accounting  and am moving on to obtain my masters degree this next year My mother is an opioid addict and a narcissist and my father is an enabler and has been a participant in the verbal and emotional abuse just as much as my mother  They have stolen thousands and thousands of dollars from me  on top of the rent that they charged me every month  Before I was really privy to what they were doing  I had a joint checking account with them which enabled them to take as much money from me as they wished  I was able to get my own bank account and transfer the funds I had left  which caused a horrific situation for me at home  In the past when I have challenged my mother on anything  she has threatened me  She has told me she would call the cops and have me removed from the household  that my things would be on the front lawn when I got home from work  or that the locks would be changed and I would be unable to get back in the home and if I attempted to get in I would be legally charged with breaking and entering  She has gotten herself into a fair bit of trouble with her opioid addiction and has dragged me and my siblings into it more times than I can count  We found her unresponsive on the toilet one night  called   and after she came to and the paramedics told her they strongly recommend going into the hospital  she made my ten year old sister sleep in her bed to make sure she kept breathing through the night She is a pathological liar  a horrifically gifted manipulator  and is all about keeping up appearances  Her spending plunged her and my dad into bankruptcy several times  When I was  years old  the first time my sister and I reached out to our extended family for help  we found out that my parents had also stolen upwards of   from our familys trust  which provided   to us each birthday and Christmas  every single check went into funding my mothers drug and shopping addiction  My parents have belittled me and told me I was worthless my entire life  They called me greedy and useless when I would ask about the money they stole and would tell me I was a loser for still living in my parents home at such an old age  Long story short  they have done some terrible things and the abuse has always remained hidden  I was a high achieving student as was my sister  and no one suspected a thing because we never told anyone anything  from the outside  we looked like a pretty perfect family  The scary thing is I thought we were too until the abuse became more apparent and my moms drug addiction became glaringly obvious  When I tried to reach out to some people who knew the family  they told my mom and my mom told them I was clinically insane and was seeking treatment  The gaslighting and roller coaster of emotion has honestly made me feel like I was insane  One day the world is falling apart and the next  everything is fine  If I ever so much as brought up a traumatic event  both my mother and father would say   what do you mean   or   youre crazy  get some help   Despite my mothers constant immoral behavior  she has never seen real consequences because she can talk herself out of virtually anything  and everyone believes her sick  twisted stories  I even catch myself believing them sometimes and even feeling bad for her After reaching out for help years ago  my younger sister was able to find other  less abusive accommodations  as was I  However  shortly after I had moved out  I went straight back  I have been there ever since  stewing in a silent kind of misery  I have developed many mental issues and unhealthy coping mechanisms to survive  Every day is a massive struggle for me  I harbor extreme amounts of self hatred  and I am afraid to leave my parents house because I am nearly certain I will crash and burn  On a logical level  I understand that these feelings are a symptom of abuse  Knowing this does not change the paralyzing fear I feel to step outside of the abusive situation  Honestly  I feel very hopeless  trapped  and drained to even tackle adulthood as it is now  thinking about escaping this situation and healing from it seems like an insurmountable challenge  I do not want to live this way anymore  but I dont even know where to start,4810,880

good heart he was irreponsible and bad with money When i was  years old i witnessed and stopped your first suicide attempt My life as a kid was bad Surronded by gangs i tried my best I didnt join them I got beat up because of it  i was beaten almost every single day anyways so more pain did very little for me Someone saw me get beaten by a mob and told you i was in a gang and that was an iniciation Thats a lie  the only male rolemodel i had my dear grandpa who was sick his whole life but did his best   I couldnt do this to him joining a gang When i was out of highschool i started working and living life trying my best Dad was in debt grandpa payed all Soon grandpa died Before he died i promised him to take care of the family We almost lost the house he left us dad tried hard and i did my best We saved it I was working in a slave labour job with barely any money i didnt quit i did my best Dads health suffered because of an accident and i needed the work no matter how bad it was   I worked if needed  h almost without pay Then my mentally challenged uncle whos his hard of earing almost went blind I quit my job to take care of him   Then dad had a spinal infection leaving him paralyzed   I yelled in the middle of the night WHY HAS GOD FORSAKEN ME No reply  Only tears I went to church i did my best Everyday i cooked  I made sure dad had his treatment so did uncle I went everymonth for his shot bought his meds went to the hospital with him Docs said dad would die  I broke down my church pastor gave me the only confort i ever received I did my best Along the day dad was receving money from unemployement and you refused to pay for his treatment So i used his money for that Never took a penny for me even tho you did One day i cant draw money from the ATM from your bank account mom and uncles You accused me of stealing your pension   I left the house Nothing on me but my wallet my bible  bucks and the keys to a home i didnt know id be able to comeback to I returned home for something that i think was one of my books I managed to convince you to go to the bank with me by taking a ride from my friend from church Dad has a credit card The debts were old I never stole anything you didnt care tho After we leave the bank family friend who we trusted deleted passwords for entire family for Social Security and Finances   I recovered them Dad transfered to a rehab facility he recovered thanks to a miracle from god and alot of good will   You keep saying horrible things   When i told you i was sexually assaulted you didnt care   Still i kept going When a doctor risked her job to assure my uncle had his surgery i did my best I had to quit the queue and had no papers to prove it if i left I trusted the doctor and in gods will She operated regardless of no papers at the time before the surgery   Uncle could finally see a tiny bit from one eye I was happy The same doctor you badmouthed complaining about the price of the medicine my uncle takes while you have plenty to purchase it   You no longer have debts I took care of it Dad is walking and alive I managed to get him a retirement pension and a supplement for his disability And now im disposable    I do not know where things will go now I will likely have no place to comeback to But i kept my promise old man i took care of them Im tired All i wanted was love and a peaceful life I never wanted your money nor anything you think i did Just peace love and to be normal Im so tired Why couldnt you love me Why What did i do At the age of  or  was my first attempt at ending my life I was saved by an old man I wish i could remember his face Life is filled with pain I have tried Loving you Caring for you Solving your problems It is never enough You always bad mouth everyone and accused me of things i never did Soon im going away almost no money to a new place without anything planned Im leaving this here because i will be without internet for a while when i move I said i didnt care what happened after i kept my promise to my dead grandpa I meant it but i had hope our hearts could reach one another   It didnt happen Im so tired I never cared for money drugs booze going out late I just wanted some peace Either way this will end now The fire is fading the tears are flowing I cant anymore I will try to make a life far away but im so tired When i tried to reach for mental help The doctor laughed in my face I left never to comeback Im so tired If you are a parent reading this please dont let the sins of your life be the burden of your child Life as it is now for me im not sure

206,p8vs3a,0,26,Told NMom I was on the fence about having kids and she unleashed some crazy rage on me Has this happened to any of you guys  Before I went NC  I foolishly confided in my NMom that the state of the world made me question the decision to start a family  It set her off in a way that was a little scary  anger and insults escalated real fast  that I did not see coming  In between lambasting me for letting climate change political direction of the country factor into my choice “don’t tell anyone you think this way they will make fun of you for being a complete idiot ”  she said that nobody would have stood in her way of becoming a mom  I guess it was rude of me to consider the world my children would inherit as part of my decision to have a family  Or I owe her grandchildren  Lol news to me I’m still trying to wrap my head around what would have triggered this sort of completely disproportionate response from her  It bothers me from time to time,960,182

225,p8sr5u,0,2,I don’t know what emotions I should feel about my childhood  Sorry if this doesn’t fit in this subreddit right  I just couldn’t find anywhere to ask this except accidentally stumbling into here  I’m turning  soon and I’ve just started to question some of my emotions to things in my childhood  My parents marriage is basically broken  The only reason they’re still together right now is because of financial reasons  I only started talking to my dad at age  because I for some reason hated him which I can’t remember why but my brother still doesn’t talk to him  Even though we live in the same house and I’m just questioning why my mom wouldn’t try to fix bring our family to counseling  My dad has a lot of problems tho  he is abusive verbally and sometimes abuses animals aswell when hes angry  He had a really bad childhood and his parents never took care of him but I know he still loves me apart from the other things  The only reason I ever talk to my dad now is because I put in effort myself to try to  I have a memory that I tried talking to him when I was really young  probably around  and my Mom basically was jealous in a way and said “You can stay with your father then” or something similar and then I started crying to my mom and then stopped talking to my dad after that until I was  again  My brother is basically really damaged now  Hes  and still has a really bad relationship with my dad and they don’t talk at all  I don’t think my mom is ”narcissistic”  reason I was confused if I should post here but it says “Significant others and friends are all welcome”   I think shes just really immature and tried to keep us to herself instead of our dad but its damaged my family alot  But the main reason I’m talking here is because I don’t really feel emotional about this  I think I’m just accustomed to it now  I’ll probably just move on with my life after this post  I know its not how I should’ve been raised but I’m only curious not sad about it  I feel like I should feel more  Help,2014,385
226,p8sqw9,0,6,Fuckin Jim    Im so glad I found this group  I had the misfortune of being raised by two awful  abusive  selfish people and reading all of your posts makes me feel less alone  I put a trigger warning on this because Im sure reading this might bring up some feelings for some of you who have experienced something similar My nmadre deserves a post of her own  but this post is about my nfather  Fucking Jim  My nfather is an older parent  Hes  and Im   He has  older daughters from a previous relationship that have gone NC on him  Theyre in their s and s  Im the youngest of his  children that  he is aware of   I dont blame my sisters for going NC on the guy  He tells me all these stories of driving around the NW in a Frito Lay van he had converted into a hippie mobile in his s  His daughters are notably absent from all these stories  but he does mention plenty of girlfriends with young kids that were along for the ride My dad is a bit of a hoarder and he has RVs and sheds all over our  acre property full of antiques and junk thats probably been shat all over by rats and is likely covered in mold  This stuff is the most important thing in the world to him  He was never one to hold a steady job  and usually made money doing odd mechanic jobs out of a shop he built on our land  As a result we were poor and there was always junky stuff all over our property  The houses we lived in were always unfinished and most of my life I lived in houses with exposed frames with sheets separating our bedrooms to give us a little privacy My nmadre was physically and verbally abusive and mentally unstable and my father just let her do her thing to me  He also had a horrible temper and wasnt afraid of slapping me to the ground or chasing me around the house with a leather belt  so he wasnt much better  He was also a creepy pervert who was always making lewd comments about teenage girls we went to school with to my older brother  whos obviously gay  but my nfather is in denial about it   So I never felt comfortable having girlfriends over because my house and property was a wreck  my mother was an abusive  mentally unstable latina who never cared to learn English after  plus years in the US  and my father was a disgusting creepy pervert My dad is now retired and living off social security  The only person my dad treats very well is my favorite Uncle and only decent relative  My Uncle is fairly well off and is always buying my dad everything he needs and giving him money  My dad is only kind to his dog and people he knows he can get something out of  Uncle lives in California and we are in Texas  In  I was laid off from my job which paid really well  I was totally freaking out because Im the breadwinner of my family unit and there was no way I would be able to pay mortgage and bills without a job  I totally downsized my life and my father convinced me to buy this house out in the country that we used to live in before my nmadre won it from my nfather in divorce court  took off to live in Mexico  and left it abandoned for  years  The house sits on an acre and all the land around it is owned by my nfather  My nfather built a very small one bedroom cabin about  yards away from the old house   I was hesitant to purchase a house that was owned by a parent I had NC with   I have had NC with my egg donor for over  years   thats a stones throw away from my nfather  but I was desperate and the place had well water and I could afford to buy it outright with my savings  The house is huge too and about half of the house is in pretty decent shape  This would allow me to live somewhere with no rent and water bill so I could afford to go back to school to get a new job  My nfather was so excited  He promised he would help us with repairs   remember  the place had been vacant out in the country for  years   He even promised he would gift me the acre between my house and the road so I wouldnt be landlocked by his property  So I reached out to a family member that was still contact with my nmadre to be the mediator for our transaction and pulled the trigger  Its been a year now and all is not well  My nfather hasnt done much to help us with the house  and what he has done Ive had to pay him for  On top of that  hes verbally accosted and guilt tripped me into handing over about   worth of my money   I mentioned Im unemployed  right   He immediately forgot his promise to sign over the acre between our house and the road so now we are landlocked by his property and are forced to use his driveway which he says we are  destroying   I drive a fucking subaru crosstrek  its not damaging shit   if anything his awful driveway is damaging my car  He has allowed the land surrounding the one acre I own to grow up head high all around us and doesnt give us the option to tend to it  I have a  year old boy and two small dogs so I live in fear of snakes and coyotes attacking them from the tall grass and brush  He doesnt care  A few months ago he decided to pick a huge fight with me because I decided to give away a minifridge of mine that my dad stowed away into one of his many storage sheds on the property after deciding it belonged to him  I didnt ask his permission to give it away  because it was mine  and he yelled and screamed and threw stuff at me  I was crying and hyperventilating when I walked out of his cabin to my porch where my boyfriends dad was waiting to take the minifridge to his son  His dad saw I was visibly upset and felt guilty and uncomfortable  I said  between sobs  that it was best if he didnt take the fridge  My nfather was walking over at this point and he claims he overheard me saying to my FIL that they couldnt take the fridge because of my nfather  Of course  this embarrassed my nfather because I guess I made him look bad  and that was basically enough for him to decide that he hates me and never wants to talk to me again  This has really done a number to my mental health because now I KNOW that worthless junk is more important to my nfather than I am Now I live  yards away from my nfather in a house thats completely surrounded by land he owns thats overgrown and covered in junk that he cares about more than he cares about me  He ignores me every time he sees me  which is everyday  He only texts me to demand things from me or complain about how my boyfriend  child and I are doing something wrong  I live with crippling depression and anxiety due to the verbal and physical abuse inflicted upon me my entire life by my narcissistic parents and now Im stuck living next to one whos goal is to make us as miserable as he is  I have been dealing with suicidal ideation since I was a teenager  and its particularly bad right now  Ive been reading lots of books about toxic parents and reading a lot of posts on this group  which really help me feel less alone If youve read this far  thank you  I honestly dont even mind if Im talking into a void because it just feel good to put this out into the world  I guess I just feel awfully depressed and unloved  I keep struggling with this sense of hopelessness and guilt for bringing my boyfriend and his perfectly nice  normal family into my web of family drama bullshit  Im scared they will see that I am damaged and unlovable and convince him to find someone with a better family  Holy shit  Please tell me Im not alone,7453,1442

229,p8skx3,0,2,It is the little things that you never notice So the really severe elements of my childhood trauma started at birth and ran through about  years old  We were given the typical  you have a great life   speeches and one of the points always was that  we had the bigger room in the house   not the primary bedroom  but a room larger than the other two available  We never made that decision  it was made when we were like   we were originally in one of the smaller bedrooms and the grandmother was in the bigger one Eventually  we escape to the military and end up in Iraq  far from the N More time passes and we marry our high school sweetheart and end up back in Iraq  At this time the N is contacting my wife  telling her she should be ashamed that she was living in an apartment with the air conditioner running  in Texas in the summer  because I was deployed overseas This is now over a decade in the past  but as we have been talking about childhood  our wife brought up an interesting point where she kept mentioning a fan that would always run  but did nothing in the room  We didnt remember so asked for clarification  where she said that it was so hot in the room and the fan didnt help  No memory of it being hot  so asked how hot it was  she said it was the same as the ambient temperature  the same as walking into the garage And then it clicked  the reason the grandmother was moved out of the room was that either the AC was disconnected there or it simply couldnt reach the room  So we grew up with no heat   air for at least  years and became so numb to it that it didnt register  But the icing for the N side is the phone call to my wife saying she had the air conditioner running  when we literally found  some  better living conditions in a tent in the Middle East,1801,343

237,p8rr58,0,6,I’m tired of life  No I won’t do anything stupid  I still believe It will get better if I try hard enough  But the fact that I didn’t have a wonderful childhood I can look back to whenever I deal with disappointments  or a great family I can go to whenever I feel someone to talk to is a little upsetting  I wished things were different  being treated as a scapegoat and black sheep because of Narcs also heavily impacted my life  Like yesterday I had my second drivers licence lesson  I passed for the theory and the drivers instructor said that I drive very good I just need to remain calm and maybe do meditation or drink a tea that keeps you calm because I cling onto the steering wheel and he’s unable to correct it when I’m driving  That’s the only thing I need to work on but still I feel like a complete dumbass who can’t do anything right  Because of the variants most ppl are forced to work from home except hospitals I was thinking about doing something online or learn an instrument like the Ukelele or violin and do Busking for a living  until I get my degree at University  But even with that I feel like I’ll fail because all my life I’ve heard from Narcs that I’ll never be great  I also heard that maybe I should become a parent  but I had to raise myself  all the thing I know is because I watched tv read books and take notes from other parents who had successful children  so that’s not a good idea  But then again I don’t want to prove those Narcs right,1481,282
238,p8repi,0,2,Seeing the unfair treatment even after NC A long time ago I ruined my last year in high school  I was not doing well mentally and had been struggling a lot with my parents for the last years of high school  My parents were always fighting with my school and at some point even tried suing them   My parents lost   My grades in the middle of this emotional battlefield were not good enough and I had to redo my year  Luckily there is this instance where you can repeat only the subjects you failed  instead of redoing everything  I went there to then get my high school diploma  It was a city away  so I had to take the train  It was about  euros to go back and forth  In total it must have costed  euro to even go to school  My parents told me I had to pay it  I had a part time job and as of their reasoning   YOU are the one who made a mess out of everything  So YOU can deal with the consequences     euro is a lot as an  year old  But I managed  only to hear them say  You wouldnt have made it without us  Now my younger sister is going trough the same thing  The difference is that she is dropping out  years before the end of high school  So she will have to go by train for  or maybe even  years  I reached out to my sister to check up on her   I am in NC with my parents  but she is still living at home   Maybe I could help her out financially  or try to help her find ways to cut some costs  like season tickets or other things I had never known about during my time  Turns out that she is getting everything paid for  Dont get me wrong  Im happy for her as it decreases her stress a lot  And I did expect this a little because my sisters have always been treated differently to me  But it did stung  My parents reasoning was that my sisters autism was the cause of her dropping out of high school  The school didnt provide enough help for her  The school never understood my sister like my parents have  So now she is getting everything paid for  On the one hand its making my NC feel more valid  On the other hand it stings so much that I have actively been discriminated at  My parents have always told me Im less than my sisters because Im not autistic and they are   Ive never been tested  I am looking into it more now though  since my GP already noticed some traits and advised me to check for it   My Ndad is autistic and my Nmom certainly has traits of it too  but never got diagnosed  They have told me things as  You will never be as smart as they are    If you passed this course  then its extremely easy for your sister   If you were autistic  maybe then you would have been less emotional and not compare yourself with your sisters so much Are they doing this to save their imagine of autism  Or maybe to show others that they DO care for their children  Maybe they dont want my sister starting a tantrum and this is just the easy solution I stopped caring about my parents wellbeing a long time ago  but sometimes stuff like this will hit you in the face without any warning,3038,590

247,p8q2cs,0,10,My NMom is convinced our dog is aggressive  when shes not  We have a  year old lab husky mix  For some reason my mom suddenly made it up in her mind that Willow  the dog  is aggressive when shes not  She tenses up when she handles Willow making situations worse  If anything she is reactive on a leash  theres a difference  and I have been trying to teach her out of it  I told my mom her reactivity goes way down if every time she lunges  I stop  Then she gets the idea she cant pull me down the street after a few times  Ive taken her out many times  shes had positive interactions with even cats   theres a local Ma and Pa pet store near me that has some cats free roam the whole store  I remember once I was talking to my cousin and she asked my mom why she never brings Willow on play dates and she told my cousin she was agressive  I told her  Shes not aggressive  she gets way too much in other dogs faces and they dont like that and she takes the correction as a fight  And my mom freaks out way too much  making the situation worse   When I explained that my cousin said  Oh that makes sense  Its worse if one dog is on a leash too and the other is not  Im taking her to the renaissance fair and my mom is convinced Im going to get her sued  She watches too much Judge Judy and follows too many horror story pages on facebook where all they post is dogs getting mauled by others and I think all that negativity made her believe Willow is some dangerous killing machine  We only had one incident years ago when we brought her to a dog park and some idiot decided it was a good idea to have their reactive dog growling and lunging outside of the fence so all the other dogs were like  wtf is that   and she bit our other dog  he ended up being fine and I mostly blame the other owner for causing high tension and bringing a dog that should never be at a dog park  until he got some basic training or she learned to calm down   to the park  My mom is making me take a choker collar  I fucking hate those things  But whatever if it makes her shut up and convinced she wont be sued or end up on a facebook page Ill put it in my bag and only use it if I defiantly have too tl dr   My mom watches way too much Judge Judy and facebook groups where all they post is stories of dogs getting mauled or killed and shes convinced our dog is like that when shes just is reactive on a leash and she doesnt know anything about dog training a reactive dog,2475,488

257,p8out3,0,6,Please explain the logic — am I a perfect clone of the infallible  or am I an incompetent buffoon  I don’t feel as if I need to explain much background since you guys have all lived it  My mother is the “you have to reflect well on me at all times” narc and I’ve historically been compliant and done everything her way  until my s or so   I’m now in my s  Working mom  wife  no drama  I don’t know how I could do any better than that  I haven’t even ever had as much as a speeding ticket  I don’t do things her way exclusively anymore  but while I’m autonomous  I’m not a disaster by any stretch of the imagination  I couldn’t even compete as an amateur at failing at life  My company put an ad in the paper yesterday for a receptionist at another branch  in another town   The ad clearly said so and I’m not a receptionist  Still  the narc texted me around noon to ask if I were still working  because of the ad she thought I “might have gotten in trouble ” She assumed I’d been fired for no other reason than it was the same company  Granted  I’m low contact so she doesn’t know a lot about my job  but she knows I’m not a receptionist  All it took was for the name to be the same — ignore the address and job title — Papa Goulash HAD to have screwed up yet again and gotten herself fired But I don’t understand it  She has no reason to believe I would screw up  Even though I don’t do things her way anymore  I’m a successful person  I have a great job  wonderful family  no criminal record  and not just because I haven’t gotten caught haha   no bankruptcy  no nothing  I’m as boring and vanilla as it gets  I still reflect on her well  though that’s incidental now  but why does she always assume I’m an incompetent buffoon I don’t think I need to explain this isn’t the first time this has happened  There was also a time when she asked  “You’re on public assistance  aren’t you ” in front of my daughter  I’m NOWHERE near qualifying  NOWHERE   When I moved out age   her last words to me in front of the U Haul were  “Don’t get your lights turned off  You pay your bills ” One time she called me because she heard an ambulance in the distance going toward my town  because she assumed I’d “had an accident” and my then toddler daughter was therefore left alone in the house  I’M MARRIED  So which is it  Am I a perfect clone or a bumbling idiot  Or is SHE the bumbling idiot and if I’m a clone  I must be one too,2436,463

270,p8nvjl,0,2,Other Kids Need Them More  I dont know if any of you have ever had this happen to you growing up  but as a kid it always seemed like my nmom deemed other kids more important than myself and my siblings  I remember her always teaching others kids  especially her then boyfriends kids  how to cook  playing with them outside and overall acting as the perfect mother for them  especially if those kids had shitty moms   But when it came to me  it seems like the only thing she taught me was how to clean  And whenever I brought up that she acted more like a mother figure to other kids more than me  it was always the same generic excuse   They need me more  theyre not as lucky as you    And its just like  I needed you too  mom  Moreso because YOURE my mom  and if it mattered that much to her then she should help those kids by getting someone who could pull them out of that situation  of which I do admit  some of their situations were down right terrible and if I would have understood at the time  would have called CPS social services at best and told a teacher or something at school at worst  rather than just try to step in as mom and only give them small amounts of normalcy But    my dad was the one who walked me through cooking how to cook  and not just tell me to read the box   taught me how to drive  etc  And when i would mention this whenever she said she was such a fantastic parent who taught me so much  she would always say something to the effect of   Well thats what a parents supposed to do  and your dads supposed to teach you those things   Which hurts  because Ive ALWAYs heard stories from others about memories theyve had with their parents  of cooking with their moms at a young age  of getting help with things such as going to the DMV or courthouse or insurance places or what have you  basically things parents are SUPPOSED to do for with their children  whereas I only remember being told I have to do it myself because how else would I learn  right  I also have autism  so anything that needed to be done socially in person I always had an anxiety panic attack over and often got yelled at for my emotions and couldnt react like a person A lot of the time    and the TL DR version of it  too  I guess    I often just wish I had those memories of my mom  and had someone with me in several circumstances  especially so when I didnt feel unsafe doing it alone and was there to make me feel safe  who could guide me through it rather than trying to figure things out with a complete stranger who was probably already having a bad day I only made worse because my parent wouldnt be a parent,2643,497
271,p8nrf9,0,16,Nmom’s confession It’s only “progress” for me but I was  out for drinks  before leaving for college  thank god  with my parents  Nmom and enabler dad  last night when my dad left for the bathroom  My mom said something she knew would provoke me  because it has in the past before I knew better  I  like two beers in  countered with “How do you always manage to say the most wrong thing ” As in  the thing the least likely to console me and most likely to further contribute to the lifelong gaslighting I’ve experienced  You all know the drill She tried to play dumb but then I went “You know exactly what you’re saying and doing  So just stop because it’s not working ”And then she laughed and said “Yeah  I know ”The fact that this all happened when my dad  enabler  had just left the table is as good as an admission to me that all of the gaslighting and emotional abuse was deliberate  And so that she could control the narrative as she’s always tried to  But frankly  I’m happy she gave it to me  I don’t know if she realizes  but she made me feel way less crazy for reacting the way I do to the way she treats me  It still feels profoundly shitty that the person who brought me into this world feels justified in putting me through what’s felt like psychological torture for so many years  For all these years  friends and family have invalidated the way I’ve felt towards my mom and I’ve always known no one was ever truly going to understand  And I think it’s more telling she waited until the night before I’m about to leave to give me this possible tool against her abuse  But at least I know that  at the end of the day  I am not crazy,1650,309

273,p8njzn,0,20,Ndad asked me how I cooked toast today  This  something year old man claims to be smart  Hes always going on about how intellectual he is  Hes written books  He makes fun of my mothers side because theyre not very smart  all drug fucked from trauma so it isnt really their fault  And he just had a go at me because I wouldnt tell him how I cooked an egg and bacon sandwich  He didnt ask how to cook the meat or the egg either  just the bread  Hes thrown a fit over it now  I have seen this man make toast countless times  He knows how to do it I suspect he did it because I had an argument with my mother  and we wouldnt tell him what it was about   Ive had the same argument with him  and he takes her side  I just couldnt be bothered and neither could she  But seriously  Toast  I cant belive hes screaming at me because of fucking toast  I feel like I live in a fucking comedy  except its not fun for me,928,180

275,p8mv70,0,2,years NC with NEx  overwhelmed by starting the divorce process X posted to R RBNLegaladvice I posted some of this as a comment on another thread and realized that I CLEARLY have more to process than is single comment worthy   I am incredibly overwhelmed trying to figure out divorcing my abusive narcissist ex who I literally fled from  years ago and havent spoken to since  We got married in    less than  weeks after my rst birthday   I left in mid   We never legally separated  I just walked out the door   His abuse  isolation and manipulation were immensely destructive and have had a long lasting effect on my life since  The abuse was largely emotional and verbal and I have no proof police reports etc with which to substantiate the torment I lived under from   years old  That decade of my life left me heavily traumatized and  I have been too afraid to face anything having to do with him since I left even though it has led to massive economic struggle and a generally very unstable life   I am afraid that no DV organization will help me because they have limited resources and worse crisis acuity  it has been  years  I never documented the occasional physical abuse  and I have safe and stable housing now am relatively safe from him in another state  though only    hours away  a fact that makes me panic if I think about it too hard   I am in  figure student loan debt for an extremely low demand BA that I will never use and was pressured by him into getting  The bulk of the loans went to living expenses in a VERY HCOL city    He came from a well off family and was used to a certain standard  How many couples who were full time students in  paid   for a  bedroom apartment when only one of them had a job and it was a retail supervisor gig   PS that one was ME  Unlike mine  his studies were always deemed too important for him to work    I was   legally married  being constantly screamed at  insulted and berated  dont drive due to a disability  had no close family  was  hours from what little distant and struggling Nfamily I did have  and felt I had no choice but to agree to the loans in order to keep the peace because I felt genuinely trapped   He always told me his family would take care of it and I was too traumatized to question things  Borrowing the money meant less fighting and less fighting meant less hearing that I was white trash who should kill herself  Meanwhile  this year I made just a squeak over  k for the first time  He has since continued his education in physics and engineering and now makes six figures   According to a message request I received recently on Facebook  he seems to think that  despite what he put me through   things could ever be so civil that I would  just shoot him a text and work together to  get this over with quickly and move on with our lives  I know that his intense narcissism is leading him to minimize what he did to me into   we were young and made the wrong decision   which  as a friend put it   is AN adult perspective to have on the situation    but not the right one  considering  trauma from abuse that he inflicted   This man gave me severe  CPTSD that I have never been able to afford treatment for  I still dont feel entirely comfortable around men other than my partner  I dont even say my exs first name in my home  like it is a curse  For now Im still stuck with his last name and it makes me sick to say it  read it  write it every day at this point  I am worried that I cant even remotely  afford a lawyer when he clearly can  I make just barely too much to qualify for reduced fee legal aid in my state  I dont know how to explain or get anyone to take seriously the fact that I cannot and will not speak to him myself even though I no longer feel physically endangered by him  That said  I am willing to deal with mediation as long as I never have to deal with him directly in any way   The last thing I have the energy for is another long fight with the worst monster I have known  I have very little in the way of  friend or family support or material resources  a fact he constantly readily exploited and used against me  and basically Im just    scared and overwhelmed  I keep thinking that if I hadnt been raised by NMom and had family that really loved and cared about me  I would have both had support  and an understanding that I didnt  deserve what was happening to me and this nightmare could have been over so much sooner  For years now  I have blessed to have the unconditional deep love and support of an AMAZING partner   who has healed every psychic wound he could and helped me rebuild a sense of self worth  I  owe it to both of us to finally close this awful chapter and move on  but I dont even know where to start  WOW sorry that so got heavy yall,4830,921
276,p8mrhk,0,3,Triggered after watching Dr Phils episode Our Mother is a Manipulator who Abandoned Us as Children sep I just watched a Dr Phil episode about a manipulative mother who abandoned her kids and it has left me with so much to process I just want to vent a bit here Being on this sub often leaves me feeling like my parents weren´t that bad  Such horrible stuff many of you have gone through  I´ve never been physically hurt  abandoned or violated That being said I was so dumbfounded watching the Dr Phil episode  my mother used to use the same tactics while being confronted  I gave up confronting her a long time ago   like    When questioning her to understand her behavior  she made it about her  talking about how she was a victim and trying her best    Overly religious talk    making her out as a redeemed saint     I don´t remember that   When confronted with what she said or did    The  It was beyond my control  attitude  amp  xB The mothers mannerism and phrasing gave me chills because I remember exactly the same thing from my mother  When she justified not helping me with my newborn child after promising she would help me the first year  convincing me not to get an abortion and leaving me a single mother in a different country  Not showing up for the christening  even if it was she who chose the date  because my  year old brother was starting school three days after that  Telling me and my family I had become  dark  unpure and gone to the dark side  after I met my boyfriend when I was   still pressing me to get enganged and married because it´s the christian thing to do  Saying I was Moses recarnated when I was on her good side  and that my virginity was protecting the country when I was younger  Gee thanks  Tip of the iceberg of the religious talk  Telling me my dad molested my sister when she was an infant and somehow turning me into the bad person when I wanted this topic discussed by the whole family Telling me super intimate stuff about her relationship with my dad when I was way to young  using me as a therapist because she didn´t feel comfortable to open up to anybody else   You´re such a good listener   Her number one activity with me was driving around and talking And today I realise even if my father is not a manipulative person he enabled her to be this way  He is just as self absorbed  only talking about himself for hours if I let him when we talk It just breaks me to not have any family to lean on  My biggest trigger in life is seeing good parents who are there for their kids  Or grandparents or any family member  And I feel people who don´t have narcissistic parents don´t seem to be able to fathom the concept  I keep hearing from friends  well she is your mother you got to make things right  So even if she lied about me owing her money  and she was not able to prove it in any way I still payed  Because of pressure from friends to do it for the sake of family I wish there was an adoption service for grownups who were raised by narcissists  It´s just such a terrible lonely feeling not having any family  Well  yes I have a family  technically  but I hope you know what I mean  And I´m so sad for my children  Having great grandparents can give you so much but my parents never even ask about them the just start ranting about themselves and their problems Well rant over  Thanks it felt really good to get this off my chest,3424,623

279,p8me7d,0,6,Is mom a Vulnerable Narcisst or Codependent  Hi guys long time lurker and researcher here  Ive read through many threads and can relate and sympathize with a lot of what youve all been through  I dont want to bore anyone with every detail of my life story so Ill just try to stick to some of the main general points  but its still quite a long story so please bear with me  I am well aware that we shouldnt be trying to diagnose  but mom makes excuses to not go to therapy and we have constant issues every few months even though Ive moved out  So in a way this is my way of venting and I appreciate whoever reads it I lost my dad at age five to a heart attack and mother enmeshed me because she seems to see my father in me  She met someone new about  years after his passing and she began to drink a lot when she would go out with him every weekend and come home until am  I would usually be babysat by a cousin who was like  at the time although she would call to check up and leave food  Eventually her new man moved in with us  years later and it always seemed that he would try to compete with me for affection and sometimes quite frankly resent me a bit  there was snide comments here and there and friction  He wasnt completely terrible  but has an abrasive personality that people tend to dislike definitely arrogant and narcisstic due to his success  I never disrespected him and accepted him and was eager to have a half sibling  Mother started having issues with him after first sibling was born  She always had very little if any boundaries with me and shared way too many details including intimate  I was exposed to quite a few inappropriate things that I shouldnt have heard or been told  It sometimes came from the step dad too  mind you this guy would sometimes come out of the shower naked and not care when he would forget his towel  Mother also had an explosive temper and would yell at me constantly over any mistake I made no matter how trivial  Mistakes that kids make like forgetting something when she sent me to the store  There were times shed get so angry over something she would pull my hair or throw things at me and cuss me out  and sometimes say things like useless good for nothing  To the point even the step dad would sometimes be the voice of reason Almost everyday seemed to be constant yelling from her  I was constantly anxious from hearing her yelling or slamming things when shed be angry cleaning  She was a stay at home mom since I was born and when I asked what was wrong it was always about having to do so much cleaning and cooking and not being helped enough and how she sacrificed herself and was not appreciated  When I would try to help everything I did was wrong and I would never get a thank you  Even step dad would say thank you when I would help him  During age  to  I feel that she constantly put me down and it made me feel that she was embarrassed of me  She only started complementing me when I became a bodybuilder from  to   She is very paranoid and overprotective and would not let me go out much and would constantly call me or my friends when Id go out This made afraid and unable to be more independent because I would get anxious about going out and talking to people  After my nd sibling was born step dad bought her a house and I helped with k for the down payment and moved with them at   I struggled to find work in  to  so it caused some fights  She would defend me from step dad berating me or telling me I should move out at   So no not everything was negative  She seems to want to get a long and its like she has two husbands sometimes  She comes to me for support and for helping raise my siblings and to offer them advice because apparently her husband doesnt care enough She found him texting other women twice and instead of leaving began to drink more and went back to him  Eventually we had an argument and he kicked me out for sleeping in the same bedroom with my girlfriend in his house  but then apologized which is his MO with everything he does  I was finishing college and was at home until  which was my mistake  but I got a full time job and moved out with my SO  We offered mom help to leave him or a place to live if needed  but she said no  We dont feel comfortable going over after what he said to us and this hurts mom because she misses us and wants us to come over   Shes a good company when shes not angry or drinking and getting emotional    I had to instill strict boundaries because despite the damage she wanted to undo with my relationship to step dad she would still call me to vent She is constantly telling me she is hurt because I rarely call or text when I have told her multiple times I dont want to go to the house despite the fact he apologized and would prefer for us to spend time in person and in a neutral place  She never wants to go out and almost always rejects invites because she always says she feels ill   We never got to go out much since I was  because she was always tired or sick  there was times I was not allowed to go anywhere because she didnt feel good  At this point I dont know what to do  She has respected the boundary of not venting to me about her husband anymore after a few strong arguments we had  but she doesnt understand I prefer to do things in person with her or anyone for that matter  Are these issues because she doesnt know how to handle her relationship with her husband and is codependent  A mix of all  At this point what are my options besides boundaries  Will we ever have a healthy relationship  Anyways thanks if you made it this far through my rant,5673,1082

286,p8l38f,0,15,Thought I would know better than to marry a narc    I am so frustrated  I had an nparent growing up but escaped in my early s  I had nothing and struggled just for survival for years  I thought I was doing well and I thought for sure I would never fall into the trap of marrying someone like my nparent because I have a pretty good eye for narcs    I thought I married someone who seemed kind but maybe a bit incapable  There were always reasonable excuses  They never could really seem to be a partner to me  they needed so much  help   but I thought it was because they had an nparent too and they just didnt have my years of therapy yet  I thought it was  just  anxiety and depression and that they would learn how to care for themselves eventually   I recently asked for a divorce because I came to my senses  with the help of my therapist and good friends  after over a decade and realized theyre a covert narcissist  How   How did I not see this   I have spotted so many Ns in the wild  in my workplace  avoided friendships that I saw were headed to a toxic place    How did I marry someone like that Looking back  I can see the patterns and red flags so clearly  I knew all the terms  gaslighting  love bombing  passive aggression  etc    how did I not realize what was happening  I was so lonely and so unsure and so desperate to be loved  I was willing to except so little because it was better than what I had as a kid  I guess I am so terrified of ever trying to date again because I dont know if I can really trust my instincts anymore    Has anyone succeeded at this after failing once I honestly would rather be alone than go through that again  I gave so much of myself and its so painful to see it meant nothing to them and I get nothing back at all except my tattered freedom  I just feel so empty and small,1841,345

288,p8kx0j,0,6,Parenting my parents is extremely exhausting I am  but I have a baby face and look a lot younger  so people constantly are talking down on me  I get mad because Ive been parenting my own parents my entire life and I am exhausted and feel old as hell  My nparents are very child like and most of the time behave as such  Being out in public with them always makes me very anxious because they are often atrociously rude and if I dont keep them in line  theyll either hurt others and make me look like an asshole  and I refuse to let that happen We got invited to one of my second cousins wedding  I almost didnt go because I am in early recovery from alcoholism  and my parents were going  I ended up sucking it up because my cousin is such a good guy and really wanted me to be there My parents talked through the entire ceremony  On and on and on until I finally jabbed my mother with my elbow and stared them down until the message got across  Then  at dinner as the waiters were going around confirming everyones order  my dad out of no where started asking the waiter how the steak was cooked and was insisting that they cook mine a different way  I initially thought he was talking about his own steak  but he confirmed he was ordering salmon  He kept going on and on  so I put my hand up signaling him to stop talking  which he ignored  So  I cut him off and told the waiter to please not listen to him and to give me the steak as is  The waiter nervously laughed and walked away  because he could tell I was infuriated  I told my dad that I am capable of ordering on my own and that I think its rude to make ridiculous requests when the waiters were busting their assess to serve all  guests their meals  He just sat there and said nothing  pretending it never happened like children do  I cannot stomach any more public outings with my family  I do not have the mental capacity to deal with them and protect myself from being humiliated by their never ending antics  I cannot parent them anymore  it is just too exhausting and they are just not worth it,2081,393

290,p8kncx,0,2,Realizing that my Ndad is probably the reason for my crippling fear of singing in front of people Just an incredibly random thing I wanted to get off my chest Pretty much for as long as I can remember  Ive been absolutely petrified of the idea of singing out loud in front of people  I mean  it is probably my biggest fear in life  Like even singing with other kids in elementary school choir was terrifying to me  and even today  decades later  I cant sing along to a song with my friends in the car without feeling extremely self conscious  The fear is   that   bad  But I never really stopped to think about WHY that is  until recently  My theory is this  When I was a little kid  probably  or  years old   Ndad started pushing me to play music  because he himself played music and was a singer  so of course he wanted me to do that too  And anything that I did  Ndad had to be   involved with  because nothing was purely mine  it was also his too because he owned me  He did this with pretty much all of my hobbies  I just wanted something that was MINE and to not have Ndad trying to be involved  So maybe my fear of singing stems from that The thing is  I actually have a pretty decent singing voice  and it feels like my intense fear is making that go to waste  So thanks a lot Ndad  I couldve had a real talent there but you ruined it for me,1366,261

303,p8j07t,0,15,I  nb  got guilt tripped for asking to go to urgent care  I ended up having to go to the ER  This is a long one  Obligatory sorry for formatting I’m on mobile For some context  I turned  several months ago  Due to disabilities  the school programme I was in before I graduated  and a planned trip out of state  I don’t have a job  I’m working on it  but at this point in time I am not able to financially support myself and I still live at home  I also can’t drive  still learning  very nervous after a car accident I was in  Both of my parents  but my mom especially  are neglectful regarding medical treatment  We are an upper middle class family  My parents have over a million in savings  and we go on nice yearly vacations  There is no excuse Things have been better since I graduated because my mom’s main “reason” for not believing me was because she thought I wanted to get out of going to school About three days ago I started having unexplained left side chest pain  I worked up the courage and asked my mom if I could get an appointment with my GP  she said yes and I went to my GP yesterday They did some blood work and said it’s likely anxiety  I have an anxiety disorder   On the paperwork they sent me  it said to go to the ER or call  if symptoms worsened A few hours after the appointment  my chest pain worsened  I had increased pain  moving in certain ways was painful  and I couldn’t get in a full breath I texted my mom asking her to take me to urgent care  this was before we received the document from the GP   My mom said no and had me come lay downstairs with her and my dad  this is when we received the document electronically  My mom is the one who got it and I sent it to myself on her phone   When I read that I should be going to the ER  I started to speak up for myself a bit more  I told them I don’t feel well  I’m in pain  and I’m having trouble breathing  My mom said I wasn’t in “respiratory distress” and that she was right there and could see I wasn’t having trouble breathing  I would estimate I was breathing   times a minute  normal is    I also couldn’t talk for very long without stopping to catch my breath  Both my parents told me that if it’s so bad that I have to go to urgent care  then I would have to tell my friend’s mom I couldn’t pet sit tomorrow  Which is another attempt at trying to guilt trip me  but my friend’s mom is practically my mom and is very understanding so it was no problem My dad started guilt tripping me because “the hospitals are full with COVID patients ”  “the doctors are overwhelmed with COVID ” And that I “would be taking a bed from someone who needs it”  I called him out on guilt tripping and he said he was “just stating facts ”I eventually argued with them enough that my mom said “Fine  I’ll take you to urgent care ” And my dad asked me if I “really wanted to do this when the hospitals are overrun ”My mom and I go to urgent care  She is clearly pissed  but turns into the “concerned mom” once we get to urgent care  We are checking in and she says “why don’t you sit down while we wait ” Luckily I know her BS so once she got to the front of the line  I got up and stood with her to check me in  By a turn of fate  turns out we needed my ID  so my mom went back to get it  At this point  I inform the one of the women at the front desk that my GP said I should go to the ER or call  if my symptoms worsened  They jump me up the line and I am taken in to get an EKG I told the nurse and the doctor what my GP said  They asked me why I was at urgent care and not the ER  I inform them that my mom is Just Like That and that she wasn’t even going to take me here  I was crying while telling her this When my mom gets back  she is taken into the room with me  The doctor chews her out  Tells her if my GP says that I should go to the ER or call  if symptoms worsen  then I should be at the ER right now and “I know it’s none of my business  but your kid is obviously afraid of you and that’s not okay ” She tells my mom either she can drive me to the ER or they can call  to take me My mom chooses to drive me to the ER  When we got in the car she tells me that “It really hurt my feelings when you told the doctor you’re scared of me ” I told her “I don’t care  I didn’t  She realized that herself  You have been doing this to my medical stuff for years and you finally got told you were wrong ” After which she was quiet At the ER  I eventually make her leave  I told her to go home and I don’t want her their she said “but I want to be here and make sure you’re okay ” I got pissed off enough and told her “ I  don’t want you here  Leave ” She left  I’m lucky I’m  otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to  If she didn’t leave I think I would have had to get security to get her to leave After she leaves  breathing gets really hard  I collapsed when I got up after they called my name  I get chest x rays  they look at the EKG I got at urgent care  take blood  and give me an IV and some fluids  It’s nothing immediately concerning  Nothing wrong on the chest x ray  EKG is normal  heart sounds normal  They don’t know what’s wrong  I got referred to a cardiologist and I need to make that appointment My mom comes and gets me from the ER at about am  She pretends everything is fine in the car  None of us have talked about the whole situation  I don’t know how to address it or if I should  My chest pain is still there  but I got a prescription for a lot of ibuprofen  It hasn’t gotten worse  Moving around is still uncomfortable  but I’m okay  I don’t know what I’m going to do about this whole thing,5658,1113

308,p8ii0n,0,6,Im just so conflicted and hurt    So  this past Sunday I had met up with my NMom and her husband to catch up  really I just wanted the Christmas stuff that had belonged to my dad   and Ive been dealing with conflicting emotions about it since  and yesterday has only made it worse My step mother  aka my Mama  and my older sister  Ill just call her sister as I rarely speak to my younger sister  were in town yesterday and decided to surprise me and pick me up from work so we can all hang out  and then theyd come over to check out my new place  I was so excited  they live a town over so I rarely see them in person anymore as I dont drive  massive anxiety issues  and theyre always too busy to come out my way  Our last official hang out was Thanksgiving last year  Ive seen them both in person once since  So this was something I was absolutely over the moon about  time with my Mama and sister  a treat  Boy  was I wrong Their idea of a hangout was to drag me to a high end lingerie store so they could shop for over  hours  Im ftm  although still in the closet  so lacey bras and panties aint my thing lol   The whole time they talked to me for all of  minutes  mostly just to inquire about the things my NMom had said n whatnot  I was just so uncomfortable and awkward the whole time  I had just gotten off an  hour shift and still had to get up at am Friday morning for work   They were both having a better time and obviously getting along so much better than with me  I felt like such a third wheel  And then because they spent so much time shopping  they barely had time to check out my new place as they had to head back home as they had plans for the evening And then the most heartbreaking thing for me was that they basically told me that if I ever wanted to do a day trip  or go off roading with them anytime in the future that I had to bus to their city  easily almost  hours one way  because I was too far of a drive for them and it was too tiring to get me if they had to do the driving for the trip all day  and of course gas would be too much  even though I offered to pay for some of it   Its like a   minute drive to my place  so like I can understand where theyre coming from  but ouch  My Mama has posted her near daily travels here  there  and everywhere in our local areas over the pandemic  shes an avid hiker  its how her and my dad met  And my sister never goes anywhere  shes a bit of a homebody for the most part  But like  I know I shouldnt expect people to drive me everywhere  but with them telling me that Im basically too much of a hassle to get and I have to do all that to earn their time  it fucking hurts  Theyve barely spent time with me anyways because of the pandemic  its always been a hassle trying to plan anything with anyone because of conflicting schedules  so Ive just stopped trying  I feel like a burden  an afterthought  and they were supposed to be my support  we all grew closer after my dad died  so I thought at least  And thats where I feel so conflicted  The person Im supposed to hate  My NMom  was nothing but attentive  supportive  and dare I say loving during our visit  My Mama and sister spent more time together even when they had me around  barely talked to me  and were rushing to drop me off and leave  I had to  ask for a hug  I think they wouldnt have said I love you if I hadnt had said it first  My NMom hugged me twice and kept reminding me how much she loved me the whole time  I know it might be manipulation  a front  but with how the family Ive chosen to stay in contact with is acting right now  its fucking working  Im so confused  so lost and hurt  I dont know what to do  my heads a mess and Im so overwhelmed my brains been on autopilot all week  I feel like a burden  like my Mama and sister would be better off without me  Im tired of having to fight for peoples love and attention  I feel so alone  This sucks,3961,776

310,p8if9d,0,18,Dad punched me and tried to choke me   Over the dog scratching my little sister  I came out and heard her crying  my dad was mad at the dog and I told him not to hurt the dog  Once I said that  he came up close to me and physically threatened to hurt me multiple times because he doesnt like  being told what to do   He always goes on about respect  and talking back  etc  Now this is what caused it  I told him  he was such a good father  for threatening me  This isnt the first time its happened  its happened at least  times  Weve had these tensions for years now  but this is the first time hes ACTUALLY hit me  If anyone wonders my age  im   He always tries to control me in some way  and has a  nice facade   Its hard to explain everything in good words everything hes done and well  but its probably not wrong to say hes a narcissist  If anyone says anything  youre right that me saying what I did caused him exactly to go off  But I could not help it  like ive said  we have had these tensions for more than  years now  He always physically threatens me for anything I try to say against him I dont know what to do  Do I permanently cut him off  In my eyes  everything hes done over the years is irredeemable  Put his hands on me multiple times  threatened me many times  and now he chokes and punches his own kid  Should me  my mom  him  brother  etc try to sit down as a family  I wouldnt trust anything from him EDIT  my mom told him to move out or we will  and he is moving out  Or at least thats what hes saying,1554,302
311,p8i8tf,0,4,Longpost  I recently stood up to my abusive Mom but Im unsure of my next steps For some background  I am College age  Only recently  with my newfound freedom and being away from my place of abuse  am I learning the extant of my issues and where they lead back to  This is my first time posting on this sub  and first time reaching out on a forum about this Ive been doing Low Contact with my mother for a while  and visiting for a weekend once every   weeks  mostly to see my dogs and friends in the area   Last year I had to stay there over Christmas break  and it absolutely fucked me  I started the next semester regressed and depressed  Due to reasons  I had to leave dorms for a week and go back home  This was greatly distressing  and I talked to some friends  and my sister about it  and what I should do  That in of itself was a big step for me as prior I had never talked about my issues at home before  At the time its what was normal The plan was to politely  but assertively set some basic boundaries and try to get along  Like please dont burst into my room while Im working  please knock  That was respected twice and was more akin to door pounding than knocking  The third time  I said I was busy at the moment  so she opened the door anyways telling me how she thought this was stupid  that she was my mother and it was her house  that she didnt see why I was treating her like this its not like Im beating you  I said yeah  but you used to  She walked away So then with that  and the larger fact that I felt like a frog slowly being boiled by staying in that house  I decided it wasnt going to work and that I would leave  for the sake of my own mental health  I told her that I was just staying for the weekend  and for the rest of the week I was going to stay with my  nonexistent  boyfriend  She didnt react  I guess me coming out and leaving early cancelled each other out  As I was packing my things she asked  are we good  I told her that it was difficult for me to stay here for long periods of time  that there were some bad memories here  I gave a few examples  she had no memory ofc   that I didnt think of her as a complete black white villain but I think after the divorce she was very angry and often took it out on me  that despite that I was still trying to make it work with boundaries and that I wasnt going no contact like my sister had and that that should be appreciated at least Her response  That since I had so many bad memories here she guesses she should sell the house then  Then  a pseudo apology of im sorry IF  then into a YEAH I was angry ykno your father    I wasnt going to hear anymore and I cut her off and left  Stayed at a shitty motel for a little bit then drove a distance to my Dads  Talked to him about things and have since been taking the time to work through shit To briefly paint a picture from where Im coming from  my early childhood lt  was alright  I spent most of the time in after care centers as both my parents worked  but it was alright  When I was   my parents started fighting  and by  they were divorced  I liked my Father a lot more  but it was my Mom who got custody  The rug got pulled out from under me   During the divorce she accused my Dad of all sorts of false heinous shit  no low she wouldnt stoop to Then  I was alone with her  and things started to get worse  I was  and am  still a lot like my Father  She hated him  I reminded her of him  and so she hated me  She tried hard to change me  Dragging me to various doctors and therapists to medicate me and find out what was wrong with me  Of course  the issue never was the home life  it was ADHD  ADD  Aspergers  or many a other of various label I got sent to a psych ward  not for cutting or suicide attempts  she never noticed that  I had stopped cutting at this time and was just beginning to develop healthier copes like dissociating and escapism  for stargazing on the roof of our story house  Afraid I was going to jump onto the grass and kill myself   Being surrounded by properly fucked up people and stuck in a small room for majority of the week wasnt too fun at   I got sent to a bootcamp a year later for reasons I still dont know  She still maintains she thought it was like a Boy Scout camp  Their website and marketing did nothing to imply such things  Also wasnt too fun She was emotionally and verbally abusive  One time in Elementary  I was being bullied and tried to confide in her about it  She asked  what were they saying  I told her and she laughed  She thought it was hilarious and then echoed back to me the same words my bullies were saying to me on the school yard  She told me I had to learn to laugh at myself  and I was being too sensitive  She became one of my bullies that day  Some phrases that are burned in deep  and that I echo to myself   I hate you   I wish I never had you   Shed call me names too  most frequently  little shit  and funnily  son of a bitch   lol  She was physically abusive  I watched her beat my Grandma and my dogs  She had no hesitations to smack me  or if I was making a fuss in a restaurant to take me outside and beat me  This didnt last as long as the emotional abuse as I got to be a tall kid quickly  But I remember when it stopped  She was chasing me through the house with a rolling pin like some shit from looney tunes  I ran into my room  got to the far end of my bed to have a barrier  she came at me  I kicked her away  She then flipped modes like a switch and started to weep and said I was going to kill her If we got into an argument or if my grades were low she wouldnt hesitate to throw my computer games into the water behind our house  learned to pirate tho     Once she took a bat to my computer because I was spending too much time on it  She accused it of being my god lmao She was  and is  controlling  She has looked through my phone and texts  When I got a girlfriend she did not approve and encouraged me to break up with her  She unapologetically read through my childhood journal  Every science fair project as a child was a fight for control  I wanted to do science  but I wouldve done it wrong  It was her idea  her way These things  Ive been coming to learn  have affected me in the following ways  not exhaustive  still learning   I am completely clueless as to what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like  I have a bad track record with dating narcissists and rejecting  or rather avoiding  the love of genuine  kind people  because it is unfamiliar and alien to me Self harm  I never learned much how to process my emotions  I did my best to suppress them  but painful emotions in particular would knock down the walls I built and flood me  When they did  not being able to process them internally  I learned to cut myself so I could at least process them physically  With age I tried to stop this because I knew it was unhealthy  but I learned Ill just subconsciously swap vices  such as knowingly going into dangerous situations so I could get hurt by others  or substance abuse  spent a year abusing psychs just fucking my mind up   I also tried to kill myself twice Emotionally Avoidant  Although I desire it greatly  I am scared of emotional intimacy  I have a tendency of once getting close to a partner or friend  distancing myself from them  or acting shitty towards them so they will stop caring about me and leave me alone  I have a deep subconscious belief that I am not deserving of love or care What Ive done so far  Ive been meditating and introspecting a lot  I have learned to practice self love  and positive self talk  I am now able to comfort myself  and encourage myself  Ive learned to talk about my problems with trusted friends  I still get distant for a bit after I do  but they are patient and I come back to them  The distant periods are gradually getting shorter  Ive been reading a lot and doing general self development work  Im currently reading  The Emotionally Absent Mother  by Jasmin Lee Cori  Its been a difficult book to get through  but Ive been able to identify the things I need to work on  and why I am the way I am  Its been greatly helpful so far and I encourage others in similar situations to give it a read What I plan to do  Free myself  financially  cellularly  and on the internet  Close completely my old shared checking account  have already opened my own at a different bank   Get my own cell provider  Purge all internet accounts that my Mother is aware of  Also I have been hunting for a therapist  Ive been calling for one each day  but my insurance isnt great and its been a slog What Im still grappling with  Finding a substitute   cure for self harm tendencies  Ive noticed if I dont consciously engage I will subconsciously find ways to hurt myself when things get shitty  Ive been practicing more self love and these desires have been reduced  but I still worry about relapsing the next time I get a depressive episode How to prepare myself for actually dating and being a good partner  Its very important for me to get over my attachment issues  and from reading it seems one of the best ways to do so is to develop a secure attachment with someone  Most commonly these are done through intimate relationships  but I feel wholly incompetent  and in my experience I either get hurt or hurt the other person  so I have been avoiding this aspect of life Going Low Contact or No Contact  I still have friends in the area around my home that I like to see  which would be much harder to do without having a place to stay  I also miss my dogs very much  and I mostly have been visiting home for them  But at this point NC seems best Open to any advice questions book recommendations or sharing of experiences,9802,1838

314,p8hznl,0,48,Story I posted in AITA  parents gladly accepted my brothers admission to my old dream school but not mine 😬 So  for context…I am a twin with a twin brother    years ago  I got accepted to Texas A amp M University architecture with a scholarship…but my brother didn’t so I had to sacrifice my admission since my brother couldn’t get into their engineering program  It didn’t help that they hyped me up all high school senior year to go  then when my brother didn’t get accepted  i was expected to reject my admission because supposedly It was too expensive of a school to go to  Well  I am still in my undergrad at another university  after depression issues  and my brother graduated with his undergrad this spring  He got accepted to the masters engineering program at TAMU  and my Family happily celebrated… now saying everyone in the family should now be an Aggie because they are finally having an Aggie  🙄 I am a year away from graduating with my undergrad  and they are telling me I should go to TAMU to do my masters  I basically told them no  that I rather go to UT arch now since after research it’s the best public school in Texas  I even told them that since I was a  year old kid they destroyed my dreams of ever wanting to go to that school now and I don’t want anything to do with TAMU after what happened We are dropping my brother off today  and I can’t help but feel like I am an asshole because my mom keeps asking why I am not happy for my brother  Honestly  I just feel very mad that my parents made me sacrifice going there  years ago and when my brother got accepted to the university  it’s suddenly so great and all the kids in the family should go  I am usually forgiving  but when it comes to this i get really emotional teary eyed that I can’t forgive my parents  It fucking sucks hearing them talk about how great the university is when I could have gone there a long time ago  How do you guys think I should combat this feeling I have  Am I being an Asshole Edit  I gotta add  I am relatively close to my brother  I just feel like there been distance between us ever since he graduated and got accepted to TAMU  He’s been talking down to me more lately  and It feels like the TAMU thing is just a big rub in my face like  yes I won  I am going to TAMU  and you didn’t  I graduated first from college  and you are the older twin type of shit Edit   Parents kept asking me why I was sad  and i ended up telling them the truth about what I told you guys  Dad got really furious at me  and my mom started making a scene by crying  Dad told me that I am nothing to this family  and they don’t need me around if i am just gonna bring negativity when I am at home  They said that I will never be cared for like the way they treat me  and I need to know my place  Dad also told me i am his weakest child  and I am just spoiled and need to open my eyes to who actually cares for me  My apartment is about  hours away from cstat um yeah that’s about It  Cried throughout the argument  then i was cut off from finishing the argument when i had questions about their assumptions  I cried  but my dad forced me to smile then patted my shoulder as i smiled and said  “you are much prettier when you smile ” Yeah ThAts about It  I guess lol,3268,631
315,p8hynm,0,2,Frustrating conversation with my mother  My N mom is     Rather difficult to get along with   We have both roughly agreed to keep conversations light and not really discuss heavy things since she  cant handle it  or whatever   For reference  Im  and have to live with my parents because I became disabled and unable to support myself due to genetic conditions that are out of my control   Well  today  before my doctors appointment  I was talking with her about media  first Star Trek and its actors and then Arrested Development   She really likes Arrested Development  which is fine  I like it to an extent but its also got a lot of stuff that makes me uncomfortable   I mentioned to her that  the show is like    funny to me  I like the slapstick and some of the weird situations that would almost never happen in real life  stealing a house for example  but the jokes about disability and LGBT people arent something that I  as a disabled trans woman  like    Apparently  that was  too critical  and  PC culture is ruining everything where we cant even say R••••d any more about people who are R••••••d when its just a medical term  and how when I watch media I  only look for negatives in it   and  dont just enjoy the media for what it is  instead everything has to be negative    Coming from the person who is currently half yelling at me over saying that   of a show made me uncomfortable but otherwise it was fine and its just a product of its time   I pointed out how you can be critical of media while still enjoying it  and that doesnt make you a bad person  its not a personal attack on you  and when even doctors dont use a term anymore  maybe theres a point where you should understand that its offensive   Apparently that too was a personal attack because she went on and on about how I  think shes a bigot or a racist or a homophobe or whatever  because she  likes some media with offensive jokes    My E dad came home around the same time I got back from my doctors appointment  and I talked to him about it  and he was basically like   I dont know how else you could phrase it  sorry    Like  it doesnt help that both of them tried to tell me for years I wasnt trans and are  only now  kind of accepting of it   They call me the correct name and pronouns mostly  and have shown theyre capable of change  but theyre still anti covid vaccine anti mask Trump supporters who view  The left  as the evil boogeymen who are coming to  trans your children  or whatever   Its so frustrating that I cant   healthily   criticize media without it being a personal attack on my mom   Sometimes I wonder if my mom is even abusive or narcissistic  then this kind of thing happens where she puts all the blame on me and how I  lied since I was a child    She even tried to blame my lack of mobility on my depression   My doctor today was like   No  early childhood trauma can cause pains and such  but being less depressed wont make it go away,2988,552

317,p8hpr8,0,18,My Mother is Trying to Get My  Year Old Sister to Waive Her Legal Rights Without Her Knowing So for context  Im early s  recently graduated college and still live at home  My younger sister is   and has just started school at an out of school university  Ill call her C  for this post  I stuck around for her  and now that shes going to be out of the house for the majority of the year for a while  Im beginning to work on moving out  Scroll all the way down for the TL DR  Throughout our lives  my mother has been rather controlling  I was never allowed to walk to places in town  even the public library  which is two blocks away  or attend sleepovers  Even now  she tracks my and my sisters phones  She always justifies it because shes anxious about our safety  and she was always our main caretaker  My father was around  but outside of driving us places he never did any actual raising  He also enables my mother in everything  Cs move in day was a rush  My mom was scrambling to get forms signed before they left  which I assumed was standard college stuff  Then she starts talking about getting them notarized right away  just to come back frustrated because they needed an appointment and two witnesses  I heard the words  power of attorney  and then I started snooping  She bought a pdf pack of legal forms  which include a Health Care Directive  Proxy Directive  and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care  a HIPAA Release Form and Durable Power of Attorney for Financial Decisions for C  I made copies of the forms when she was asleep  and then read over them  I even found the website she bought them from  which advertises this packet as  what if your  year old out of state college student got into a car accident and you the parent couldnt access their medical records because theyre legally an adult now   The reason Im absolutely certain she didnt read them  and didnt let C read through them or explain what any of the legalese meant  is because my mother didnt know they had to be notarized until the last minute  Shes honestly been treating it like standard college forms  The first one  the Health Care Directive and Durable PoA for Health Care is fine  Its basically giving my mother rights to make health care decisions should C be incapacitated  and a directive about what actions to take if she was ever permanently in a vegetative state  The only concern I have about that is that its a strange thing to make your adult child sign without explaining what it is  Its the HIPAA Release Form and the Durable PoA for Financial Decisions thats worrying me  HIPAA is basically healthcare privacy  and as far as Im understanding  this document would apply indefinitely to every doctor in the US C will ever have  My mother would be able to access any and every medical record about anything  including reproductive health or therapy   whether C is  or   The language on the Durable PoA for Financial Decisions implies that it would apply from the moment the document came into effect  not just in the case C became incapacitated  It gives our mom control over all financial aspects  credit cards  loans  stocks and bonds  even mortgages  Given that my mother wanted C to sign all these forms last minute  I have no doubt C hasnt actually read any of them and assumed they were whatever my mother told her was true  This also might be a direct result of something I did  Im transgender  and my mother wasnt supportive  so I started medical transition without her permission or knowledge  I think the legal forms for my sister are at least partly a result of that  I also went out of state for school  and my mom didnt try legal forms with me  just emotional pressure  Luckily  my mother cant get the forms signed the forms nor can they get notarized until Cs in state again  which wont be until the end of this year  once her winter break starts  This gives me time  Im a little afraid what my mom might do if C refuses  I also know that if C refuses  my mother will blame my interference  whether or not she has any proof of it    TL DR    My mother tried to get my  year old sister   C   to sign off on Durable Power of Attorneys and a HIPAA release form  which would give my mother control over her finances and access to any of her medical records indefinitely  without explaining that said forms would do that  My mother was unable to get the forms signed  but I have no doubt shell try again when C is back from school  C goes to college out of state  in a few months  My father enables my mother  and therefore is no help  I am definitely going to talk to C about this  Its her first time away from home and shes just beginning college  though  so I dont want to ruin it for her with something that isnt immediately urgent  I was also thinking of hiring a lawyer to read over the forms to make sure Im understanding them right  However  I barely have enough money to pay off my

333,p8ftxe,0,2,Mom putting me in the middle of her issues with her husband  my stepfather  Unsure how to proceed with severe boundary issues and physical safety concerns  amp  impending “visit ” My    mother    has been married to my stepfather    for  years  Their relationship started as an affair and they both abandoned their spouses and children to start their life together  For additional context  my mom sat my dad and me down at the same time  I was still in HS  and told us she was leaving and literally drove away  I was left to help support my dad  who quickly became a severe depressive alcoholic  Over the years  I have kept a decent relationship with my mom and stepdad  recognizing that marriages are difficult and my parents never had a perfect life  so I always tried not to blame her or create tension  I visit them on holidays and vacations and we’ve always had a fairly pleasant relationship  For the past few years  my mom has been having increasingly serious issues with my stepdad  and she has no hesitation calling me in the middle of drunk arguments or unloading on me  calling me in tears to get my advice or opinion on issues between them  I have tried to draw some boundaries in our relationship  including doing some emotional withdrawing and talking about my own concerns with mental health experts  which has helped me  My mom will pretend that negative or emotionally charged conversations between us simply didn’t happen  and expect me to pretend that everything is fine and normal immediately afterwards  My mom and stepdad have a trip to visit me planned for two weeks from now   I live across the country from them  Today  she once again called me in tears and unloaded on me about their financial issues  which include him having to pay child support for the two kids he abandoned  to the point where my mom  who is approaching retirement   has no savings or nothing to fall back on  My mom has cut everyone else out of her life because they didn’t respect her decision to abandon her family  and has always put so much pressure on me as “all she has left ”Currently  according to her  she is not on speaking terms with my stepdad  They are cohabitating but not speaking  and he has made it clear that he has no plan to support her when she’s supposed to retire  They already bought tickets and a hotel to come visit in a couple weeks  even though the latest financial concern meant that he had to unload their entire savings to his ex wife or risk going to jail  Today  my mom told me that she expects him to “behave” on the trip  and that she told him that he’s “lucky” they already bought tickets or it wouldn’t be happening  She also casually said to me “oh  maybe you can talk some sense into him ” I am in a position where I think I need to say that I’m not comfortable with the trip happening given everything that’s going on  especially because the expectation is that I would just play nice and pretend like there’s nothing happening  I have considered saying that she can visit on her own  or they can just cancel it outright  My fear is that they have previously gotten into drunk arguments that have escalated to physical violence  and they have lots of liquor and guns in their home  they live in the middle of nowhere in a very rural area   Anything I do to react to what I’m hearing right now would likely promote an escalation between them  and I don’t trust either of them not to get violent  Of course  I know that such a response is in no way my fault or responsibility  …Man  when you write it all out  it really sounds different  doesn’t it,3609,649

349,p8dmru,0,2,Anyone notice how your abuser plays the victim after standing up for yourself  I grew up with a somewhat absent father  My mom would work  cook  clean  and give me attention while my dad simply babysat me and when my mom would come hed be bolting out the door to sell and smoke weed with his friends  Hed yell at me for the dumbest of reasons  making me cry everytime  Eventually he started spoiling me with McDonalds and crappy PS games just to be the  cool dad   My mom and dad had been separated of  years now  since I was   Ever since that shes been dating men that all fit the same criteria  middle age  unattractive and redneck  Safe to say she had her heart broken multiple times  The second last time this ugly troglodyte of a man abused our dogs with a shock collar  A few times she would ask me  a  year old kid who was very naive  if they  mom and troglodyte  should stay together  One time I said no and after that she said they made a  pact   Then I was sexually assaulted via dry humping and stole over    with a fake Bitcoin scheme  After that  we kept having this guy over and she did this  sneaking out  scheme where he would be left without anyone  I was visiting my real dad and told him about the situation  He called my mom and threatened to call the cops  she swore to herself and me that she wouldnt date anyone on focus on being a parent  Not even a month later  while she was supporting a local DJ that was friends with her  she met her current boyfriend  Get this   she made the first move  After that they became friends and started dating a week later  I was indifferent  I kept to myself and stayed in my room all the time  But then I met him  At first he was pretty nice to me  but because of the past I didnt hesitate to not trust this guy  At first I found him to be creepy he had a rather obsessive liking for trains  with a couple of religious memorabilia and a clock with a Japanese school bell in his house  At the time i had an interest in electronics  Arduino  R Pi and the like  so he gave me his old breadboard kit and I lost interest almost immediately  At first he said I was an  alright guy  and then it spiraled into me being disrespectful  This  combined with my extreme right wing political parroting at school  Im center left now  made me a rather bratty kid  It eventually led to him telling me that hes going to beat the shit out of me  hospitalize me  etc  A good example when he was  ft apart from me and made punching moves toward my face  This man was   Another example was when we were going out camping  he had tapped me on my ass  saying  good job  for something I did  I freaked out  asking him if he were gay  I was closeted at the time  he had gotten very confrontational  threatened to beat me up and put his hands on me and pushed me  I went back into the camper and he started comparing himself to the  old fuck on the farm  and he  wouldnt take shit from nobody   Instead of trying to correct any hatred between us  my mom decided to add fuel to the fire by having us move in with him not even a year later  It was awful  Cops were being called by me every week because I felt like my life was in danger  with good reason  But every  single  time  the chief of police would tell me over the phone   Shut the fuck up  do what your parents are telling you  and stop calling us   The same chief had threatened to punch me in the face  and even shoot me  I had my crotch grabbed  I had been told by him his penis size  I had been told that if I were a girl itd be neat to want to masturbate  all while hes telling me Im a pedophile for being gay  and would show me  evidence  that the LGBT is full of pedophiles  I had been told by him that  because of my poor handwriting  I shouldve been held back to the third grade A month ago  I had been confronted for using a shower without their permission Stepdad  what the fuck Me  what Stepdad  what do you mean  what  We started arguing and he would use personal attacks against me  such as me being a  menace to society  and that  he cant wait for me to move out at   and  youre lucky I have self control so I cant beat your fucking ass   The final straw was when he had come up to my face  feet close  puckered and blew a kiss  I said  thats really funny   YEAAHHHH   Replied Dave  I tell you what  I fucking SNAPPED  I punched him in his stupid  ugly  fucking face  And then we finally fought  And Ill tell you what  it was a full on BRAWL   eventually I got arrested for assault and now have a court case  After all the years of me being made fun of  being mistreated by authority figures  and this is the result  Are you happy now  You decided to put me on trial and potentially put me in a horrible place with   surveillance  violent inmates and possible human rights violations  I could very well be going to juvie for  months  which Ive only been to for a night  Thanks  America  Im going to juvie and hes labeled a victim,4990,959

359,p8ctv8,0,10,PTSD from parents showing inappropriate content as a child    T W r pe assault scenes in movies  I’ve phrased the title as a question  because this is something I am wrestling with and whilst I’ve signed up for therapy and I’m waiting for an appointment  I just wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar When I was around  years old  I was playing on the PC in the living room  I don’t remember the time but I know that I didn’t really have an enforced bed time by this age  and my mother put on one of her favourite movies   The Accused starring Jodie Foster  I’m not going to go into the details here  but there is a very graphic scene involving the main character being sexually assaulted  I vividly remember being frozen to the spot  asking my mother to please turn it off as the scene was upsetting me and my mother telling me that if I didn’t like it I could “go to my room” and I should have but I felt rooted to my chair  That night I went to bed and the scene just played over and over in my head  My mother offered no context or explanation of what had happened in the scene or made any attempt to soothe me This happened a few more times over the years  different movies but similar scenes and I reacted the same  rooted in the chair in fear but unable to look away  My mother never turned off the scenes or talked to me about them afterward Even to this day  if The Accused is mentioned my mother raves about it being one of her favourite movies and I am left feeling sick I’m now an adult  however I find these scenes to be triggering   much more than discomfort though  If I come across a scene in a movie or tv show I will obsess about it for days and have the urge to read more about it or even rewatch it even though I know it will distress me even more  I will keep playing the scene in my head over and over  not on purpose but it won’t go away I have to google movie plots and parent guides before I’ll even sit with my partner to watch something  and it’s exhausting I guess my question is has anyone else been through something similar and do you have any coping strategies  I’m searching it up on the internet but not finding much If you read this far  thank you,2221,418
360,p8cnvm,0,6,Is this Emotional Incest  I f  want to start this off by saying I love my father    He is a good man and we generally have a good relationship  however recent events have opened my eyes to a pattern of behavior that doesnt seem healthy for a father daughter relationship My parents divorced when I was   My mother remained single  but my father married a woman when I was  and later they had my baby sister  They eventually split up after  or  years but throughout their relationship  he would complain to me about women and taught me not to be  one of those women   He was very sexist and I eventually started calling him out on it as I got older I am the eldest of his  daughters   hes changed his view on women but it took a lot of talking arguments  and hes still nowhere near being considered a feminist  He has a different relationship with each of his children and the dynamics are constantly changing  I know parents arent supposed to have favorites but I always felt that out of the  of us I was his favorite this changed recently   He would always tell me he expected the most from me out of all of my siblings  and that hes scared my siblings will leave him when hes old but not me  He spent countless hours lecturing me on how to be a good person and telling me what kind of woman he wants me to be  I dont think this was conscious of him  but I feel like he was molding me into the type of woman   he   wanted to be with  As I got older he confided in me more and more using me as a free therapist  This stopped after I eventually snapped and told him to stop treating me like one  My father is a very generous and caring man he would give someone the shirt off his back if they needed it  but what he gives each of his kids is very different  He gives my brother the eldest  technology and pretty much anything he sees as practical  He gives my sisters the babies  anything they want theyre not very materialistic though so its mostly crafts supplies  He gives me grown things  we were all living in a  bedroom apt so he bought a house and said it was for me  I was getting bruises all over my back from my bed so he bought the whole family new beds mattresses and said he did it because of me  Dont get me wrong Im very grateful for my fathers generosity but those are   huge   financial burdens and that puts a lot of pressure on me  Hes always put a lot of pressure on me so I dont think he even realizes it Our relationship took one of its biggest hits after I started dating my ex girlfriend  To be fair she was an awful human who manipulated and gaslit me constantly  but she did point out a few weird things about my relationship with my family  She told me once and this could have been a lie  that my father told her mother that because he didnt have a wife I would have to step up and take on the role of the woman of the house  They were constantly at ends  telling me to do two conflicting things and both expecting me to listen to them blindly  They both expected me to cut off the other  I was obedient and young so trying to please them both ended with me ruining my relationships with both of them  The thing that finally tore our relationship apart was when I moved in with my boyfriend last winter  We rarely talk now  He never says  I love you  anymore  It hurts and idk why hes treating me like such a disappointment  Im doing well for myself and I like to think Im a good person  idk why thats not enough,3480,660

368,p8c3s8,0,5,Im a Bipolar ex Alcoholic Opiate addict  and my mom is a complete psycho that is obsessed with everything I do  Im a  yr old male and with the exception of Pot have been clean since May th   and my mom has been an obsessive control freak since I was in Middle School  I was always a good kid growing up  Never got into trouble  didnt party and always avoided drama  Shes done it all  Gone through my phone  to read messages and get my friends phone numbers to keep tabs   listened to my calls on the houseline  followed me around in the car  to this day Im constantly terrified shes watching me from somewhere in the distance and Ill see that gray Toyota Sienna   interrogated my friends behind my back  even threatened my girlfriend when I was  to not see me anymore behind my back which was devastating   keeps tabs on me by checking public records for any tickets or recent arrests despite me not being a felon or ever being charged with a misdemeanor  keeping tabs on credit card purchases  an adult friend of mine once wouldnt even come over when my parents were out of town because she was convinced my mom had hidden cameras in the house etc  Needless to say  she has no shame in stalking my every move if she even remotely suspects Im partying  Heres the thing though   this was back when I was in my early s working   hrs per week trying to become independent and just have fun with friends when I had down time  Growing up she was the exact same way except she was EXTREMELY religious  Christian   Im a Atheist so yeah  that was insane  She grew up in an extremely religious and dysfunctional household with an abusive Valium addicted mother who did the exact same crazy stuff my mom does  My mom vowed to NEVER end up like her  but she has  I got kicked out for two years at the beginning of  when my substance abuse continued  only I had recently been diagnosed as Bipolar  I also have Aspergers and have always been told Im extremely intelligent and talented  I play guitar and specialize in heavy metal which is what I aspire to do   but Ive always been extremely insecure and depressed  Ive always struggled making friends because of my awkwardness  but despite my kindness I always get stabbed in the back or abandoned by my closest friends sooner or later that Ive only ever been there for  When I got kicked out every single one of my  friends  immediately ghosted me  but only after making me out to be a piece of crap which seems to be the go to way of handling people these days among most  When I was homeless it was nothing more than the  tough love  approach when I know it was just a selfish attempt to control me again  She only wanted me to get clean so shed stop worrying about me all the time  but she convinces herself its always with good intentions and not narcissistic ones  I went through a cycle of living on the streets all strung out on Vodka  Crack and hardcore Opiates  Psych Wards  in patient rehab for  months  Sober Living Facility where Id get kicked out after several months because of a bad relapse then repeat the cycle  After a two week bender on the cold streets I decided abruptly on the night of May th  I was done  and oddly my parents let me move back in the next day which was weird because they were so stubborn about it  Been off the hard stuff ever since and I dont do any of that mainstream recovery crap that doesnt seem to help anybody in the long run anyway for the most part  you see a lot of the same faces going in and out of those types of facilities   If you just believe in yourself you can do anything  I hate that mainstream recovery programs push religious  step mumbo jumbo and codependency  Anyway moving on  she is literally like a mad scientist when it comes to my medication  Bipolar  addictions etc  No matter what improvements I make shell always find a way to make it out like I need more professional help  As shes getting older  mid s  shes becoming more and more stubborn and unwilling to back off  Before shed actually listen and attempt to make a change in her behavior  Now she just seems to not care at all  All she ever talks to me about now is Bipolar  mania  addictions  Psychologists  doctors  support groups  peer support  working with a job agency  even though I already make my own independent money just fine   and whenever I casually mention going on a trip  seeing a friend or trying out a dating app she makes the same dumb  predictable  anxious grimace that immediately reveals shes thinking the worst  relapse   Ive explicitly said to NEVER talk about Psychologists  I hate them because theyve only ever made things worse  or my personal life  yet she does on a daily basis  Once I finally cant take it and I assertively say  No more  Im done  and walk away  she talks AT me like Im a spoiled child  I finally realize that she has always viewed me as a helpless little boy that needs assistance in everything he does  She holds my past mistakes against me  and feels   in her right to violate my privacy and business even if it means stalking me  Shell occasionally take into account what I say when I finally lash out because shes not getting the hint  but she ALWAYS goes right back to her old ways within a week or two after trying to be more aware of her behavior  I in general am realizing now that Im clean just how narcissistic she really is  She constantly seeks the approval of others and when she doesnt get it she gets offended  she is obsessed with my well being to the point that her well being relies on my well being  she cant take negative criticism of any kind even if it comes from a number of people but complains all day about people being to sensitive these days  She talks AT me  not to me  and she forces advice at me even when I dont want it  but if I come flat out and say I got it or no I dont want help she gets agitated at me  oh yeah  shes the most passive aggressive person Ive ever seen   This is literally not even the tip of the iceberg  I know Ill move out one day  but Im just grateful to be in this big luxurious house where I have the entire finished basement level all to myself so I never have to see her upstairs  The reason Im still here honestly is because once I move I want it to be permanent  I have no idea where I want that to be yet  The big reason though is that Im still recovering from the psychological distress of being homeless for two years and everything that happened before and during all that sadness  Sleeping on wet  stinky concrete behind the dumpsters in the cold night rain next to the vacant eleven gas station I managed years back while chugging vodka and shooting Heroin because my girlfriend and best friend both died less than  months apart is pretty horrible  Theres nothing like feeling everybody you ever loved hates you and has only proven their selfishness by not even giving you a couch to sleep on for the night or to call every few days to see if youre okay  Nothing  I wouldve done anything I could to help a friend who was in my shoes  Why are people like this  Why is my mom like this  I feel like everything everybody tells me is just a lie  Even the doctors  I was taking several different meds none of which worked  I abruptly quit both the anti psychotic and anti depressant  months ago and now just take my mood stabilizer once per day and smoke a bunch of Pot  Havent been manic since and its awesome  yet my mom is convinced that Im constantly having some type of episode just because I might be tired or slightly agitated  Im the last person to play the victim card because I pride myself on my resilience  but it really does suck having seething resentment towards your mother when theyve done so much good things for you  but the bad stuff they do is so far beyond acceptable that these mixed emotions pop up  This is my first time posting on Reddit so I hope this works out  Stay safe out there,7975,1475

394,p89kxl,0,2,If and how to open up to my brother    who still lives with nMom and eDad Hi everyone  this is my    NC with biological parents for   years  first post after reading and commenting for a week  I hit some kind of rock bottom lately  Something I worked really hard for made it possible for me to really relax for the first time in my life  I have never been outside of survival mode and as wonderful as it is  I am becoming more and more aware of how much of a sprint  fight and mostly nightmare my life has been until now I am looking into therapy options at the moment and  I guess  taking quite good care for myself Even if I am NC with my biological parents  I am still and have always been in contact with my slightly older brother  I can not exactly explain the bond we do have tbh  We had a hate love relationship as kids  thanks bParents    but got quite close when he had cancer  He was   We got to be a team to  silently  support each other and live through all this together  After that the connection got loose as I left the house as soon as I turned   I needed space  Also had lots of feelings of regret leaving him alone We still saw each other from time to time  Mostly on birthdays etc  Since the pandemic we are seeing each other only as the team of siblings which is so cool  We even had some deeper conversations  but I get the feeling this is extremely hard for him as his circle of friends is more the type of party friends  As I got used to trusting people  opening up and talking about feelings with new friends I found  He does not feel comfortable talking about his feelings  but is able to open up a bit when he is talking to me  Otherwise he has a few topics he is just really into and loves talking about that non stop  which is very exhausting for me  At the same time I love people beeing geeks and learning weird stuff I am starting to think about trying to talk about our childhood with him  He is the only one who experienced the same reality as I did  maybe in a totally different way  Yet I can not even imagine his position as he still lives in that house  due to lots of reasons   Could be healthy for both of us or really bad talking about it Not sure how to approach it to be honest  Id love to at least tell him about me going into therapy this year  but I do not know how to approach that kind of conversation Maybe some of you went there before and you have some kind of advice for me  Thoughts on this much appreciated,2482,476

435,p84hbl,0,2,My Nmum loves to make every thing about her and it drives me crazy  I will give to you guys two examples one of which happened today even thoe I could pretty much list more than that but it would get too long of I did Basically I have been mad at my Nmum since yesterday when she embarrassed me at the dentist so i keep telling her to leave me alone when she asks me questions  Here is the link to that post  https   www reddit com r raisedbynarcissists comments pdy i actually hate my nmum she lied to me and then So basically this morning when woke up around   I went downstairs to get the house phone to call my gp  I live in England so thats what they are called idk what they are called in  other countries or of you guys even have them  because I had this medical issue for the past two days that wouldnt go and the house phone wasnt working so I decided to call them on my phone and I decided to stay inviting room when calling them because I was tol tired to move of the couch  As I was calling GP my mum asked who I was calling and I told her the GP and then she proceeded to ask me a billion different times what was wrong and what my medical issue was and I didnt want to tell her because I was still mad at her and this women who is my mother litterly startred to cry when I wouldnt tell her in response I told her I dont have to tell you everything about me and she said that since she is my mother that no I do have to tell her everything and I just didnt respond and just spoke to the receptionist at the gp and she advised me to go to my local pharmacist for my issue I hung up the phone and my mum was still crying and insisting I tell her whats wrong and at this point she was annoying me so I just told her and then she was like what do you want for breakfast and i told her I dont want anything and to nonsense surprise she satreed crying again that I wouldnt eat anything  Btw my Nmum quite literally has an obsession with me eating and at one point it got too much and I even had a emotional breakdown over it  I will write this story afterwards because I want it to be its own separate post  And I just left and told her to stop crying since all I did was not tell her what was wrong me it at first and say I didnt want to eat any food and I dont think thats stuff to cry over And another thing my Nmum made about her is the passing of my uncle a month ago Basically sadly my uncle passed away a month ago and him and my auntie were pretty much the only family members I didnt hate and he was just amazing which is the opposite of his toxic daughter and my cousin And every since my mum found out and she would talk to someone about my uncles death or tell them that he is dead she would be would go from normal to balling her eyes out and then when she would hung up the phone she would immediately stop crying  there was only this one time she continued to cry after hanging up and I think the reason she did that was because me and my sister were in the same room as her and i think she wanted the attention to be on her  And my Nmum would even cry when on the phone to my uncles family aka my cousins and auntie and they were sooooo annoyed at her that they would immediately hung up the phone the second my Nmum would start to ball her eyes out And then my Nmum mum also cried infront of everyone at my uncles infront of his kids and my auntie and one of my cousins even confronted her and again I think the reason she did that was for attention Like Im not saying my Nmum isnt allowed to cry Im just saying after the whole crying whole on the phone and not crying after hanging up and only crying infront of people just made it suspicious Like even when me  my Nmum my sister and my uncles family went to see my uncles body for the first time since he passed she was the only person not to cry idk maybe she ran out of tears or something but if she missed him soo much that she would cry whenever someone was around why didnt she do it then it just sounds suspicious overall Do you guys think Im reaching with my second story and maybe turning it into something it isnt and being paranoid,4173,808
436,p84dwn,0,177,My  year old floored me today with his emotional intelligence For context  I’ve recently gone no contact with my mother  who acts as the enabler to my father who was physically and emotionally abusive to me as a child  I haven’t spoken to him in many many years  but whenever this comes up in conversation with my Mum she acts surprised like this is brand new information  In other words  she gaslights the shit out of me This week she tried to get me into a situation where I’d have to have myself and my kids around my Dad and I put my foot down  told her enough was enough and never to contact me again  It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done  I’ve given her way way too many chances Anyway  as you can see  when I went NC  I said don’t contact ME  So what arrived today in our letterbox  A letter addressed to my  year old son  I asked him what his thoughts were and he immediately said ‘throw it away  I’m not interested in joining her army against you’He’s fucking  and he knew what she was doing better than I did  He was able without knowing anything about flying monkeys to see that she was trying to turn him into one It actually made a lot of the anger I had go because when people see and validate stuff when you’ve been gaslit your entire life it’s like someone giving you a blanket I do try and shield him from a lot of this but it’s difficult to know how to navigate stuff like this  The letter is gone  we didn’t read it or return it  My parents live in another country so they have had very little involvement in my children’s lives  I just hugged him and told him how proud I was of him  I’m in the UK but fortunate enough that I have access to private therapy which I’ve decided to pursue starting next month I’ve put a tag on for support because it’s been a while since I’ve had to deal with this stuff so I’m kind of a mess and success stories for therapy and going NC with an enabler narc would be appreciated,1962,374

463,p7wwco,0,2,Is my mother a narcissist  TW  suicidal ideation  possible sexual abuseIm F  diagnosed with depression and bpd  I am quite sure my mother has bpd as well  especially since it can be hereditary  and Im aware bpd and npd tend to be combined with each other Throughout my life  she has given me the  tough love  treatment  I was the mixed race child w a man she never loved  so I suppose I always reminded her of that  She herself was a victim of abuse by this man and her own parents  generational things  different ways of raising kids  She often threatened both me and my younger sister  whom she may favor since shes not half white and is the daughter of a she loved  with abandonment  with one old family video depicting my mother threatening to send yr old me away  As for abuse  its mostly emotional but can be physical  I get most of the physical abuse  A few months ago my therapist called cps over an incident where my mother kicked me and tried pushing me down the stairs  Since then my moms gotten nosy abt my therapy and tells me what I can or cant say  and says shes now wary of me bc Im making a story to get her in trouble  fyi cps didnt do anything because it was a one time incident for them  A few months ago I was suffering from suicidal ideation  and whereas my mom cried for me then  now she says she only cried because she was depressed herself  and when I asked if she really wanted me dead  she replied with  are you threatening me   Though to be fair  during the cry session she said that if I committed suicide itd seem like she failed as a mother In fact  she is very much all about her appearance  saying that I should fix so so about my behavior because it reflects on her   What am I supposed to say to my friends when my daughter is lazy and useless   She also discourages my sister and I from ever telling anyone  family problems   I recall when I was   I broke down crying at school and went to the counselors office because someone told me that my mom never loved me  and I got triggered by that  I pretty much confessed everything to that counselor  it was my first time meeting one  When I got home that day  I told my mom what happened  and she yelled at me for telling  family problems  to the school counselor  I regretted telling her that  I regret most things I tell her Its not like were ever encouraged to tell her thingd anyway  Sure  she says  never keep secrets from me  Im your mother  but whenever we are honest with her we get scolded  And every conversation always deflects to her and her own pain and suffering and how we  the children  have to step up to help her  Were  too young  to have problems of our own  and yes  we acknowledge that she did grow up dirt poor and worked to send money to her family  but certainly falling back on that story every time doesnt justify it right She always tells stories about herself and makes herself sound so inspiring and whatnot  with the whole growing up outta poverty and being   open minded   yet she never listens to anyone other than herself  Shes homophobic  racist  once threatened to cut me off should I ever marry a black person  because  theyre  all witches    inappropriately sexualizes her teenage daughters   you look like a whore  maybe if youre raped youll learn   and puts them in danger Before vaccines  I once told her that we needed to leave her favorite restaurant because it was obvious that CDC guidelines for covid were not being followed at all  abd the place was packed of maskless people  She got super pissy and told me  what  are you afraid to die  my immune system is strong enough  even though millions have died  When she finally did comply  I later asked if she had hand sanitizer  to which she pulled her own out and used it but didnt share it with me  She gets her  science  from facebook  reptilian conspiracy theorists  and a preacher on youtube who claims people get sick because they left god  She also just    doesnt stop when we tell her to  She sometimes grabs our private areas in jest  and with me  Id told her multiple times I hate it when she compares me to my dad  a horrible person  or describes the US as  your country  or  your people here   for context  im asian american  not born in the us  basically raised racist against my white side   Shell be all sweet and apologize in that sarcastic tone  but she doesnt stop it  In this family  we never learned  no   I get the brunt of most of it  but for both my sister and I  shes never asked about our interests  our feelings  never cares for our pride and achievements  unless shes comparing us to a friends kid  and constantly expects us to read her mind regarding stuff like housework  which she never really taught us to do  properly   When we ask to be taught how  were criticized for not knowing  Aaaaanyway  I think thats enough writing lol  I didnt wanna just assume she was narcissistic because Im no professional  though i guess well never know since she hates therapists  but I know a lot of this comes from generational trauma and the poor parenting skills of back then  plus her abusive relationship with my biological father  Regardless  I know that shouldnt justify it happening to us  She uses it to justify her abuse  her  lack of control  but I guess I need to hear a second opinion  If you read all this  thank you for your time,5375,977

469,p7vtqe,0,4,Emotional abuse is mind warping  and seems impossible to prove  Childhood trauma makes me feel invisible  long post  Typical helicopter parents  I was born early  almost  months  it was a horrible birth  emergency C section  mother was in a coma for  weeks and i was in the NICU for a little over  months  I got all the medical care I needed but i was underweight all my childhood due to very very low birth weight  and having been tube fed in the hospital  So why were they abusive  As soon as I could understand the words coming out of their mouths  I was told that i can trust no one  Take for example  my father is walking with me in Sears as a   year old   I cant remember the age but it was quite young  He always told me never wander off  never run away from him or someone will grab me  cut my head off and throw me in the river like John Walshs son Adam  who was taken from a Sears  He told me how that little boy was taken from a store like this  Okay  peanut butter story  I was a  delicate kid who struggled to gain weight  So  my dad wanted to force feed me  He asked me to eat spoon of peanut butter when i was young  I said no  because I didnt want to  He did not take kindly to my refusal and decided that if I will not eat it  I will wear it  He grabbed me and spread the peanut butter all over my face and put me in the corner  I remember the disgusting feeling of tears going through the paste on my face  It was gross and humiliating and I hated it because i just didnt wanna eat the peanut butter  As of a year ago maybe  he grabbed some peanut butter and a spoon  He tried to get me to eat a spoonful again and i just started screaming at him to fuck off because Im done with him trying to force feed me  He heavily contributed to the development of my EDNOS  eating disorder  hes shamed people all my life for their weight until it has wormed its way into my own brain  Hed say bad things even about my own mom  who is not thin   My  nice  grandmother has still joked about how i used to have a vice grip on her shirt while i sat in the cart when she took me to the store as a child because i was afraid someone would steal me away  They had their laugh but I didnt  My th grade teacher held a parent teacher conference once  as she thought i was being abused at home  I believe this was based of my startle response is  very  active  and i flinch at loud noises and sudden movements  i clarify  i was not hit  much  I always took slaps from my mom a couple of times  straight faced  I did face getting spanked by my dad but it was nothing to write home about  The thing that bothered me was I have hit my dad and he hit back but one time  i was in my room  We were fighting about something  and raised our voices  But he was getting into my personal space so I went to put my hands on his chest to push him away  not shove him or anything  but he thought i was going to hit him so he smacked me over the head  I backpedaled to go to my bed and he followed smacking my thigh and i was telling him to stop i didnt hit him i just wanted space  I was almost crying and said i just wanted my space  I was shocked and as i was backing up and crawling onto my bed  I was scared  I felt as though my dad lacked in the bonding department at some point and i didnt feel as connected to him  He made me a walking stick on a camping trip a long time ago and got angry with me and broke it in half in front of me  He fixed it  but its shorter than it was  Both him and my mother belittle mock me  A few days ago my dad helped me put on a tanktop in the kitchen  i was wearing a sports bra  and i never felt so uncomfortable in my life having him help me put a shirt on  My mother said Im like their little doll  When I was in Jr  High  i was told i wasnt allowed to go to a school dance  I went anyways  and didnt come home on the bus  When i didnt they freaked out  I got home and they yelled at me  but then they said to get out so i went around the house to go in the backdoor because they wouldnt kick me out  I ended up physically fighting my dad  and although i held out well  did not win and stayed outside  They said theyd keep me out all night  so it got dark and i watched the moon in this old shed that nobody bothered to upkeep  Dad gave me a sleeping bag at some point  so that was decent  I layed there and watched the moon until i saw a blinging light  It was dad with a flashlight telling me to get up and come inside  He told me they let me back in because theres some rapist on the loose  idk  I was glad to be back inside  I complained about this to a couple friends the next day and i guess someone reported it because i went to talk to a lady and she asked a lot about them  I now know that lady was a social worker  i was completely unaware until my parents expressed their displeasure at me telling people and getting them in trouble  I cant remember anything else right this moment  that was just the more significant moments  If I think of anything else  I might make a continuation in a comment  But yeah  it feels like lies  except now that I typed it all out  it sounds a lot more real than it did

470,p7vicr,0,21,The abuser twisting the fact that their victim is resisting them does not make the abuser the victim  PERIOD   I am leaving to go to college tomorrow  I am excited to finally be free of my nmother’s abuse  She somehow thinks that by citing her “loss of patience” with me  for what  I do all my college paperwork on time despite her endless explosive anger about it  I have stellar study abilities  I have been studying calculus   hours a day for the past week and a half  and she thinks that because I plug my ears to stay sane and shut out her psychotic  out of the blue  multi hour long  door battering screaming sessions about the latest and greatest petty problem  she has a right to “lose patience” with me and therefore kick me out  I kid you not  she had at least  individual door pounding and psychotic screaming sessions today about how I need to sign a piece of paper for vaccination requirements  Her tirade had   to do with the problem and   to just insult and threaten me  The fact that I am resilient to her psychotic onslaughts which she will do for hours  unstoppably  without any remorse for the horrible things she says about me  does not make her the victim of the abuse she does to me  It makes her the abuser  It’s that simple  The abuser twisting the fact that their victim is resisting them does not make the abuser the victim  Period     That being said  one of the common denominators for her favorite things to say during her latest petty explosions is to lie that the fact she and my father wanted to kick me out is somehow proof of how they are the victims when they are abusers  because it would be “unlikely” that both parents are abusive  When I mention that yes  it’s clearly the case  she just laughs dismissively and continues glorifying my violent  physically and emotionally abusive ndad and victimizing herself  It’s a way of saying  “Oh  so you think I’m abusive  well  now you have to prove that we’re both abusive  Since you’re in a shattered state of mind from my relentless torture of you for the last half an hour  Im well aware that youre not in the state to dive into every single one of your most sensitive and traumatic memories from us  so the fact you can’t list every specific instance of obvious abuse proves that I’m right ” Remember  she always initiates these abusive gaslighting sessions from the pettiest of everyday circumstances  Shes twisted Welcome to gaslighting   and retreating into generalized fundamentals to force the opposition to overthink and go crazy addressing specifics  Using the fact I survived my textbook abusers to self victimize will never  ever work  In fact  it’s such a stupidly false argument it hurts to even make sense of  It’s like her many racist  homophobic  anti vax  covidiot comments that are so immature and false that they hurt to even think about because the mere thought of such absurdities gives them a level of validation far greater than they deserve  which would be none  I can’t wait to go to college and surround myself with positive influences so my reasoning will never again be tainted by petty  psychotic  unempathetic  gaslighting abusers like her  I will finally be free and happy,3212,556

473,p7us6u,0,4,Cutting of narcissist parents  afraid of losing my siblings in the process    This is quite long so I apologize I’m flying home tomorrow with the intention of talking to my parents and giving them the ultimatum  acknowledge that my father physically abused me and apologize or I will end my relationship with them  No more holidays together  No more phone calls  Nothing  I don’t want to re hash anything or argue  I just want to hear those two statements  and then I can move on For context  I am late twenties  I was physical abused by my father between the ages of  and   I was the scapegoat  my mother knew and did nothing  and my siblings knew and also did nothing  To this day I “exaggerated what happened” or “remembered things differently than what actually happened”  When I tried to get help I “was trying to tear apart our family” and when I tried to get my mom to help me I was “the reason she almost filed for divorce”  It all ended abruptly for seemingly no reason and the few times afterwards I ever brought it up dissolved into screaming matches where I was labeled crazy I spent the last ten years going to therapy and processing what happened and how it has effected me and my relationships with everyone involved  We have all been civil  there have been no major problems outside of the occasional argument  I have no doubt that in their minds they convinced themselves that they’re right and I’m crazy or maybe even that they think that I moved on and forgot about it  But I didn’t I need them to tell me that it was real and that they’re sorry after gaslighting me for basically my whole life or I’m done  It’s not healthy to continue our relationship like this  But I know that they won’t give me that  they’re textbook narcissists  I’ve accepted that this is the end My only concern at this point is that I will also lose my relationships with my  also adult  siblings who I am very close with  They have always told me that I exaggerated the situation  They tell me all the time “they do so much for you  you should call them more    why don’t you come home this weekend they miss you    etc  etc ” Their relationships with my parents are fine and they are still financially dependent on them  Knowing them  they will take my parents’ side and that will be that I am wondering if losing them is worth getting the closure I want  I wonder if it’s worth playing into the charade if I can keep them around,2442,439

476,p7ucyf,0,2,I hate when people say  your   youre an adult  you can do whatever you want  Sorry but I honestly hate when Im talking about my toxic and overprotective parents and people just say   your  your an adult  like bitch you dont think I know that   I know Im an adult but THEY DONT  When people say this I know theyve never had over protective helicopter parents  especially foreign parents   I dont speak for all foreign parents its just I noticed this trend a lot with them This is especially hard for me since my parents are basically funding my college and I litteraly live with them  I cant just move out  even though I technically can  Moving out would mean being cut off and not having any way to pay for my education  except taking a bunch of minimum wage jobs  and with my lack of expirence and being sheltered I wouldnt be able to make enough money and eventually ending up dropping out of college and in the streets  Prolonging something that couldve just been over if I just stuck with them and waited to move out  I dont want to be cut off from my parents I just wish they didnt micromanage my life  So waiting to move out just seems better  But this is especially hard when you have been entirely dependant on your parents and they take away anything from you that will make you more independent because theyll feel as if you dont think theyre good enough parents and that your  rebelling   Its really hard and stressful and not everyone has the energy or the strength to just move out  I know I sure as hell dont  Most of us who leave have no where to turn to when we do  so just moving out isnt a viable option  especially for a person whos just been emotionally drained from years of their parents toxic behaviors you cant just expect them to just pick up and go   its litteraly this or the streets  And Ill take hot meals over the streets  But I also dont think you should stay in a toxic relationship just becuse its convenient for you  So I think rather than just saying your an adult you can do whatever you want  People should start advocating for support systems becuse telling an abused person to just leave a relationship with someone theyve spent their entire life with doesnt always work  You need to find a support system first and people you trust to help you get out of that toxic relationship  Getting therapy or finding someone to talk to  Im  and Im still struggling and going through this  but having a support system for me like my friends have really helped ease the burden  Please for those of you going through something like this dont give up  and reach out  Yes our parents act as if they have this hold over us but they forget that we also have to hold ourselves up  Dont let them beat you down  Im proud of you and your accomplishments are valid  There is likely also someone dealing with it too  Dont put up with their shit but also remember that you still live under their roof so you need to find ways even the tiniest ones to get by until you do have the support you need to get out  If your too afraid to its okay find the courage somehow  If you ever need to talk my pms are open,3161,588

487,p7t9j6,0,6,A few questions     Is victim personality a common N behaviour  Contempt for genuine victims  Leaving Ns company feeling drained of life  I am reasonably certain my father is a narcissist  He has exhibited many symptoms over the years  but has no formal diagnosis  I am posting this to describe a behaviour of his and ask whether or not it is something that is common recognised in narcissists  so I’ll just get in to it He has a real habit of making himself appear as the victim  Constantly  And when I say constantly  it is literally every other story he tells   I say story he tells because there is rarely any real conversation with him  rather just whatever personal story he tell that is remotely relevant to the current topic However  as much as he likes to paint himself as the victim  he is often overly and unjustly critical of anyone who has genuinely been victimised For example  earlier he was gloating about how he worked through the start of the pandemic  whilst painting himself as a noble victim of circumstance  He then went on to clearly criticise a colleague for working from home because of being classed as ‘vulnerable’  making quoted finger expressions as he says it  I asked him why he made that expression and for what reason they were vulnerable  To cut it short  it was asthma  and basically said it was a rubbish reason and they  people who were told to shield WFH  were just looking for time off work  When I challenged him on this  he remained blank and did not say anything  and generally speaking  this is his response whenever challenged about something unreasonable he has said that won’t directly end in negative consequence for him He also has a real problem with anyone our family knows who receives disability related benefits  e g  family friends who receive a car as part of disability allowance   It almost seems as if he’s jealous of people who are genuinely disadvantaged and have disabilities in life  The weird part is he has even gone as far as sticking a disabled sticker on his vehicle  and when I’ve asked him about it  he just brushes it off as ‘a joke’  It just feels so weird witnessing his constant attempts at evoking empathy for himself  but also the blatant lack of empathy for anyone else I’d like to be able to genuinely enjoy spending time in his company  but when the engagement has become nothing but a systemised and almost robotic sequence of retold stories to paint himself as a victim  I cannot spend much time in his company before feeling as if I need to leave  In fact spending too much time with him is draining   I leave feeling deflated as if the life had been sucked out of me  It usually takes me a good few hours to a day to recover from being in his company  The weight of his negativity just feels crushing I’m sure that what I’ve described is hardly anything compared to what some people on this sub are dealing with  but my reason for posting this is to ask whether or not the behaviour I’ve described is common or even recognised behaviour in a narcissist  If so  does the process of self victimisation have a name  Is a lack of response when challenging a narcissist a normal ‘response’ from one  Is it normal to leave a narcissist’s company feeling deflated and drained  as if someone has sucked the joy and spirit out of you  and if so is it normal for it to take an extended period of time to recover from this TlDr  Basically a few questions  Is it common for a narcissist to have a victim personality  Is it common for a narcissist to be overly and unjustly critical  to the point of appearing as jealousy  of disadvantaged disabled people  Is it common to leave a narcissist’s company feeling deflated and drained  as if someone had sucked the life out of you  and is it common for it to take hours to recover from this,3821,675

493,p7ry32,0,20,I finally blocked my enabler dad  My mom is a narc with what im sure is BPD and life was constantly walking on eggshells waiting for her to be  in one of her moods again   She has no sense of boundaries  was emotionally and physically abusive  and abused my sister who has cerebral palsy  Often throughout life  I felt bad for my dad because he was the  nice  one  But whenever she got in one of her moods  he would just abandon us to go to his moms or drive around  etc    but now that im older  Im realizing that my bar is so low for someone who is  nice   Its not  nice  to sit back and watch your wife abuse your kids  Its not  nice  to hit a child with cerebral palsy  Its not  nice  to slut shame a  year old for her pajamas  Its not  nice  to abandon your kids when your wife gets in  one of her moods  and then pretend like nothing ever happened  Ive gone almost  years no contact with my mom  while staying in touch for the occasional  how are you  text to my dad  I finally today blocked my dad  It took me  years to learn what boundaries are  how to be good to my inner child  and get the inner strength to block my mom  Now  its my dads turn  The cycle is this  I calmly laid out the abuse i went through and stated my boundaries  that i would need an apology to ever be around my mom again  Despite saying this for over  years  my dad will text me every  months saying  hey we miss yall  when can we meet up   as if I never said anything  Then I repeat what I say each time  because I have sympathy that he lost a son  because at least he doesnt send my nervous system in fight or flight  that hes also a victim of my mom  etc  Today he messaged me to try to meet up for my birthday asking when  We  can meet up for MY birthday and i was done repeating myself  I was done of being told my voice is ignored and doesnt matter  It took me a long time to fully feel  not only logically know   that this is not right  Yes  I blocked my abuser  but if i tell you abuse i went through  and you ignore it  thats saying its okay to harm me  Its telling me my needs are not important  that my voice doesnt matter  I have nieces that I could not fathom treating the way my parents have treated me  If she came up to me and told me someone abused her consistently  I would not be okay with that person nor force her to be around that person  Having been treated like this  I spent most of my s being treated like garbage by friends and romantic partners because i was taught my needs dont matter nor my voice  And im just now ending the cycle  Anyway  just wanted to share this enabler epiphany,2627,517
494,p7runk,0,7,I feel like a walking cloud of emotion lately and I hate it   Ever since my last blow up with my mother    I seen the narcissistic personality I was blinded by for so many years  Since then my emotions have been all over the place  especially since she hasnt called me yet after my Dad also reached out to her to her on my behalf   What hurts the most is    every day for the last  weeks I carry around a hope that maybe today shell call to try to mend our relationship and hear and understand why Im upset without getting defensive or making inflammatory statements  The fact that she isnt contacting me is becoming more hurtful and numbing at the same time   I feel like if I reach out to her shes gonna treat it as if Im done with my temper tantrum and all is well  I feel like Im holding back tears daily from all the realizations  of how my life could have been different if she wasnt so selfish  cold and controlling  I find myself wanting to overly share my thoughts and emotions with my wife surrounding my mother as I unpack how affected I truly am  I need to find a way to reign in these emotions  Im tired of being triggered by normal things that didnt affect me this way before,1214,228
495,p7rmln,0,7,I dont even know if I belong here  I dont know what I am  All I know is that I need to escape and get therapy  Advice appreciated  Im sorry if this is a mess  Ive never been good at conversing I am always drawn to this sub through peoples stories  I always feel like I can relate to how they feel of escaping or at least wanting to  Yet I dont even know if my parents can be considered narcissists or they are just plain selfish assholes  but I need a place to vent Im almost out and getting away from my parents  A few months ago  I accepted a job offer in another state and Ill be moving  I am excited and sad at the same time  but I know I really need to get away for a while  These past fours years have been the most frustrating years Ive spent since junior high  Ive spent the recent years feeling lonely and wanting to spend the least amount of time in my parents place as possible  I only recently realized why I felt so lonely  A family friend  FF  came by recently to speak with one of my parents  P  and I shared the news that I was moving away  FF was happy for me until I mentioned that the other parent  P  doesnt know yet  When FF asked why  I explained that P had a habit of posting everything to FB without consent and despite me telling them several times not to post anything about me due to the nature of my work  FF and P kept cutting me off telling me that P was a good parent and that they deserved to know and to just tell them not to post it to FB  I was getting angry over the fact that they kept cutting me off like my own feelings didnt matter to them  P and I got into a screaming match in front of FF  This isnt anything new  P and I have been fighting over this for months  Its really ruining the experience of finally getting out and Im no longer excited for it Reflecting over that situation made me realize that no one supports me in this circle  Not P  not family friends  and not the extended family  with few exceptions   The only reason I feel lonely is because Im surrounded by people who support my parents over me  Its strange to say that I feel less lonely when Im by myself in a random place than when I am living in my parents place,2207,430
496,p7rkim,0,5,Mom forcing everyone to drop everything and plan her trip Every single break we’d have  my mom would force the entire family to partake in an extremely burden filled “family” trip where no one enjoys  including her  These long ass trips consist of traveling all day  yelling  screaming  fighting  barely getting any sleep  repeat for a week or two  Our summer is basically ending and she started to cry and complain about how we “wasted” her break doing nothing  we had already traveled to two places within the past few months  and have another trip planned soon  and now she wants to go somewhere  She began to force everyone to sit down in front of a computer and plan the ENTIRE trip for her  the cheapest flights  the cheapest hotel prices  how many things were gonna do  while she sits and does nothing at all  She tried to make me do it  but I obviously don’t want to sit for hours and plan while she does nothing but complain  Because i dared to tell her “no ” she took my phone and wallet  allegedly my debit card with my money belongs to her   She fails to understand however that NO ONE wants to do this  and that we have breaks that we want to spend too  I’m forced to cancel multiple plans i had for the last week of break until my next semester starts because of her on the fly plan  I never thought that she was a narcissist  but her behavior within these past few weeks has got me curious  hence the post,1421,263
497,p7reu2,0,5,Repulsed by the thought of kissing someone   Not really sure if sexual abuse is involved   Ive always forced myself to not want to be in a relationship from since I was maybe nine  Or younger because I never trusted myself to stay out of an abusive relationship because maybe I would love them too much to leave  influenced by my parents martiage  As Im healing  Im think I might have also been covertly sexually abused  I was neglected a lot and dont remember getting much cuddles that didnt feel like my ndad was sucking sympathy out of me but aldo realized how much I dont like the feeling of skin  or sudden hugs  I am repulsed by the thought of ever finding satisfaction of kissing someone  the thought of being naked with someone causes me to dissociate  I feel like my body isnt fir me to feel pleasure and only to be used by someone else and only get aroused when its a thought of potential r     The only thing I can think of that was sexual abuse maybe is when my dad constantly smacks my butt   not so much any more   he gets mad when I tell him to stop and says hes just playing and dies it even more  Hes said my butt is so soft once and when I was pretending to sleep he smacked my butt and then proceeded to call it a big  squishy  butt  When I was younger he was looking at my boobs   naked  that happened often   opened his mouth and proceeded closer to one of my boobs as if he was going to    but then my mom smacked him in the head and he stopped This is enough to be considered sexual abuse  right,1530,295
498,p7re12,0,3,NMom loves to paint me as a problem child On her wall  my NMom has cards from both me and my sibling hung up  However  there is only one card each to represent each person respectively  My sibling has a card they write her for mothers day  complete with words of praise hung up on the wall  and I have an apology note I wrote when I was   Its been a long time since then  but she still has those two contrasting cards up to paint a limited picture of my sibling as the golden child and me as a problem  There is nothing positive about me  only that one note to completely represent my entire character Just goes to show what she really thinks of me  I guess,665,129
499,p7r6jq,0,3,Mocked for being cautious Whenever i shut the front door or ask if it’s locked my parents get all patronising and say it’s all in my head  which is not true since i’ve researched the area and found that many people have experienced break ins  I just find it disgusting that they’re not taking anything seriously  they leave the front door wide open during the day  they are literally the only ones on the whole street who do that  and sometimes unlocked at night  i don’t even bother locking it because i know they will just go out and leave it unlocked again  They try to make me sound like this paranoid maniac for a simple thing like wanting the door locked  we also have dogs which have escaped so many times yet they still seem to not care  No idea what to do or say to them to take it seriously,801,152
500,p7r2gt,0,16,I’m not sure if I should give my golden child  enabling older sister another chance  How do I know when to give up and move on  My  F  older half sister  F  and I have never had a very close relationship  The age gap certainly didn’t help growing up  but I thought that once we both became adults our relationship would improve  It has not  It has only become more turbulent  especially within the last few years  In short  my sister has almost always “sided” with our Nmom when she and I would argue  She’s always been willing to make excuses for her abusive behaviors  place the blame on me  and look the other way because she claims she doesn’t like getting involved  But then she and our Nmom will talk about me behind my back  and not in a nice way  It’s always seemed very gossipy and judgmental to me  but my sister continues to claim that they never say anything bad about me  Which is a lie  of course  I’ve had numerous conversations with my sister over the past few years about her behavior towards me and the way that she does not support or validate my feelings  especially when it comes to our Nmom  Every time I’ve confronted her  she’s promised to do better in the future and make more of a positive effort with me  And yet  she’s never changed or followed through on her words  Last fall I finally had enough and stopped reaching out to her  Of course  she had “no idea” what she did to make me “so upset” with her  Typical  Fast forward several months to the present  and she’s been waiting for me to contact her so we can have a serious discussion about our relationship  But I don’t know if I want to at this point  I’ve already made my feelings clear to her many times and have given her many chances to change  I don’t want to cut her out and end up regretting it because I didn’t give her another chance  but at some point enough is enough  I know it’s my decision to decide how to move forward  but I’d really appreciate some helpful advice,1977,366
501,p7r1zi,0,6,Does life get harder for abused children after leaving  I know life is hard in general  and Im not saying making money is easy but since were already used to unnatural levels of stress from since birth is it easier  Im  and I cant fathom the thought that if life at home is this bad than being on my own will be x harder  I know people saying enjoy your youth or your time not having to pay bills usually comes from people that may potentially have a healthy home so the kids arent used to this level of stress or so my theory is  Its just being at home with an abusive father and an emom who didnt show enough care to my suicidal thoughts is so hard I think Ill die if it gets harder,698,138

516,p7okkk,0,4,My mother died in june I am trying to come to terms with who she was  I am    my mother was  I have been living with AIDS for   which provides context  I am trying to figure out if she was a narcissist  I could not sleep last night because its like i am finally facing down the damage she did and trying to reconcile it  I had to keep it all pushed down in order to try to do the right things and be a a good daughter   Some of the many many things that stick outThe time  years ago  when my mother was still pretty healthy and she  with no self awareness at all  told me i had no idea what it was like to worry about my health all the timeTHE time when  AIDS meds had just come out and i had just started on them she sent me a letter saying that i had gained some weight and my husband would leave me if i got fatterThe mornings when i was a teen and she would scream and yell at me and call me a Horse’s ass  which was her favorite thing to call me  The when i would look upset she would make fun of me and say that i looked like a scared rabbitMy mother got pregnant with me at   People told her she should have an abortion  She loved to tell me how people wanted her to abort me and wasnt i glad she didn’t abort me All the times when i was a teen when she said that i must be a “tart” and all the times she told me i would end up spending my life working at McDonaldsWhen  my husband had his aortic dissection and was terribly deathly ill and my mother had slow moving cancer and she told me she was mad because he “stole her Thunder” She was upset because not all of the attention would go to her When i was a teen and got conjunctivitis and she decided i was a drug addict  spent  weeks berating me and and saying  “if it wasnt true you wouldnt be upset”  She then called in my brother the cop to lecture me  Finally she realized something was medically wrong and took me to an eye doctor  She never acknowledged her mistakeWhen she was terribly angry with me and told me i was a terrible person because I could not have her recover at my house after kidney surgery  I could not because i had  kids at home and would have had to give her my bedroom  at the same exact time as my husband was being released from  months in the hospital for and Aortic dissection and was literally bedriddenThe allotment i sent her for years while in the marines  that was never acknowledged  The fact that for decades  while raising  kids on a small budget I gave her a monthly stipend on top of paying her electric  cable and phone bill  Then despite my husband and i both having health issues but we had her come live with us for her final  years only to be called  irresponsible  selfish  rude  and a thief who made her feel like a prisoner I started working at  because we we’re poor and half of what i earned went to my mother to pay the bills  That was a lot of pressure on a teen  I dont begrudge this because it was needed   But it makes it hurt when she talks about how bad i am or fails to acknowledge the things we kids have done for her   The realization that out of  kids  I was probably treated the best  That at least  out of the  had way worse things said and done to themFor never  not once in my entire life feeling like my mother was someone i could go to to talk to about my own problems or issues because  everything was always about her  I never ever felt like i had a mother who was there for me in any way  In fact  i always felt nervous and literally scared when she was around  That she made sure  even in her last months  when i visited her in rehab every day that I knew where the notebook was because she wanted to make sure that I read it  She wanted to make sure we all knew how awful she thought we all were  My niece died on New years of   That morning my mother sent me a message berating me for not being friendly enough to her and for not saying Happy New Years  I Did not say Happy New Years to my mother literally hours after my niece died while plans were being made to remove life support  She in that same message said she gave up everything to move here  like she was doing ME a favor when she moved in She does not say one word about my niece  her oldest grandchild   in that message  I was walking around target yesterday to get a birthday card for my sister and i was checking the back to see if they were Hallmark cards  Why  Because god forbid you got my mother a card that wasn’t Hallmark then there would be hell to pay  The fact that i look at this list and think  maybe this is normal  Maybe this is not so bad  Maybe I am making a big deal out of normal small things For the the fact that despite this and a million other things i still love my mother and in some way miss her and feel guilty that i feel angry with her,4823,967

524,p7nye7,0,4,Wondering when   if ever   I should reconnect with my alcoholic narcissistic mom My mom was an alcoholic my whole life  I always knew that  She got on and off the wagon a few times in my late childhood  Sometimes her sobriety was blissful  Sometimes it was nothing but tension and anger  The drinking was ALWAYS awful  though  In my early adulthood  I had to escort her out of a bar  in her pajamas  for assaulting a security guard  Ive had to answer police calls because she was getting a dui in the middle of the night  Ive attended many  family days  at rehab  Almost  years ago  I quit drinking myself  I had my own run ins with the law and quit at age   Im so lucky to have this much sober time  My mom and I were incredibly close when I was young  It makes sense now  that I can see her narcissistic tendencies  why we were so close  and that that closeness served her and her alone  Shortly after my son was born  my mom fell off the wagon HARD  A night of drinking ended up with her yelling in the street  having to be pulled inside  kicking and screaming  by her husband and my brother  I have not spoken to or seen her since that night  When I had a baby  years ago  my mother was not involved with my pregnancy  I made it clear early on that this was MY pregnancy  and she doesnt tend to find interest in things that dont surround her  My baby shower was hosted by friends  My mom refused to hold the baby the first few times she met him  Even before she started drinking again  she was incredibly disinterested in my child  If she came to see him and he didnt give her a big smile  shed insist  hes just not acting like himself today   maam    hes  weeks old   Im not quite sure what kind of advice Im looking for in this forum  Part of me is certain I dont want to talk to her again  Part of me wants to talk to her  just to tell her how disappointing this has been  She has not reached out to me  She wont  Im sure shes positive she hasnt done anything wrong My child is her only grandchild  She has never seen him walk or talk  Shes never heard his voice  I want to think that her missing that is  enough of a punishment   but I want to fucking scream at her sometimes  Again  not sure what Im looking for here  I just feel so alone as someone who lost contact with their mother to alcohol later in life  I dont know anyone else in my situation and god damn    it gets lonely,2430,464
525,p7nqzb,0,12,nMom hurt me badly  I want to give her an ultimatum and could use some guidance TL DR  my mom thinks everything is about her  We recently went on vacation and claims I ruined it for her  that I dont care about her  and I learned she even tried to leave me at the airport without saying goodbye   Ive had enough  and I want to tell her to get help or we cant have a relationship  amp  xB Hi all  long time sufferer  first time poster  Some general background  I am in my late s and grew up with two nparents  different flavors of narcissism  who divorced when I was in my teens   My mom thinks everything is about her  which means she is easily offended by words and actions   When my parents divorced  she was left in a really difficult financial situation and she made a lot of sacrifices for us for which I will be eternally grateful but she never misses an opportunity to bring up her sacrifices and lord them over us     We have gone long periods  months  without talking to each other on two occasions  but have never explicitly addressed the issue because I know she wont take it well   I always end up going back to her   I have two younger siblings  siblingOne who recently moved out to live with their partner  and siblingTwo who still lives at home while they finish their degree   They also fight with her often due to her behavior   I have lived in a different state for the past few years which has made our relationship better because she cant involve herself in my life so much   but I will be moving back to our home state soon so I really need to establish this boundary   I recently just had an experience  which I will outline below  that was so outrageous and hurtful that I know I need to put my foot down   Ive been going back and forth between crying and feeling bemused by her absurdity all day   I will be having kids within the next few years and if I wait until that happens I know I wont have the emotional energy to do it   I dont want to risk her treating them the way she treats me   I want to send her an email  so she cant twist my words  telling her that her actions and attitudes have hurt her children  and she needs to finally accept that fact and work on improving her behavior or we cannot have a relationship   I want to recommend therapy as a tool   I want her to know that I love her very much but she has been hurting me my entire life and I cant take it any more or allow the same to happen to my future children    amp  xB So  the most recent event  siblingOne invited my mom  siblingTwo  and me to vacation with their partners family in a gorgeous tropical paradise   This is important to remember  because it means we were siblingOnes GUESTS   My partner was invited as well but wasnt able to come due to work   My home state is a big travel hub  so for both the arrival and departure  I had a connection in my home state and shared a leg of travel with my mother and siblings   We coordinated to ensure that we were on the same flights and sitting together   There were many behavioral things that stood out to me during the trip  and I tried to correct her in a gentle and private manner on a few of them  while letting others slide because I didnt want to deal with her reaction    Every time I did  shed get offended     She could not handle us occasionally having separate sibling time younger folks time  even when siblingOnes partners parents tried to plan separate  parent  activites  she would avoid and sabotage the  kids  instead   If she felt like we were  excluding her  by not involving her in every second of the day  she would try to insert herself   Sometimes  her strategy to insert herself is to chime in with a negative comment about one of us  your hair looks bad  that dress is too small  you have a zit on your face  etc    In these cases  Id tell her  hey  we are having a conversation sibling time here    She was constantly weird about money   We were guests and our hosts kept inviting us to things and paying without ever mentioning costs   This made her uncomfortable and shed start up awkward money conversations with our hosts which very visibly made THEM uncomfortable   I tried telling her in private to relax about  repaying  them  they arent asking us to pay  and if she cant relax she should have an explicit  private conversation with our hosts to say  hey  I want to make sure Im not taking advantage of your hospitality   Can I split the cost of the things youve paid for   and then shed know and could stop worrying   She never did this  but she did stop asking about money   Instead she pivoted to offering to pay for things in advance and even inviting them on a fancy excursion which was a great idea EXCEPT   After she offered to invite them on this outing and they accepted  she made it a point to let them know that she set it up and it was costing  XXX  but of course not to worry about it because we were paying for it   She was constantly putting down and nagging siblingOne   On one specific occasion they were late for dinner  held up by a storm  and arrived very hungry and stressed  My mom instantly started telling them WHAT to eat and HOW to eat it   Down to  cut it in half  put it on your plate  use a fork       SiblingOne was visibly distressed and I told my mom  Hey  they know how to eat   They seem very stressed  why dont you stop telling them how to eat     So she stopped telling them how to eat  only instead to start loudly commenting to the rest of the table about how they were eating wrong   Again  I asked her to leave siblingOne alone   In the cases where I had to ask her to behave in front of our hosts  I used our native language  which they do not speak  to avoid embarrassing her    She has no respect for personal boundaries  Exhibit A  I have started journaling again  stopped in highschool because I found out she was reading my diary   and I wanted to not slack on journaling while on this trip   Sometimes this meant I had to do it in front of her and she kept asking me to show her   I said no   She asks why   I said its for me   She got offended   Exhibit B  siblingOne had to purchase a swimsuit while we were out because they didnt realize there would be a beach there  There werent a lot of options so they ended up with a much more revealing style than they were comfortable with and they were shy and embarrassed about it   My mother and I were walking behind siblingOne  and she asked me to sneakily take a photo of their butt  I am  the photographer     I said no   My mom started to complain and ask me why I wouldnt do it for her   I told her I wouldnt do it because I know it would make siblingOne uncomfortable and I respect their boundaries  but if she wanted to go ahead and betray siblingOnes trust  she could go ahead   That earned me an exasperated  oh my god  pretend I didnt say anything     which is typical for her   She crosses a line and then either denies having crossed it or asks us to pretend it didnt happen   She disrespects siblingOnes comfort so often that they do not like my mother photographing them at all   Related to Exhibit B  at a later point we were at a beautiful beach  and I asked siblingOne if I could photograph them   I tried to do this without my mother noticing or being involved   They were so happy and comfortable posing in front of the camera  but eventually my mom saw and walked up and loudly complained that siblingOne would never let her take photos of them  so that siblingOne would hear and of course they immediately withdrew and became uncomfortable   At the airport waiting to depart  some paramedics approached a woman sitting near us to tell her she couldnt travel  something about the fact that while she was now covid negative  it has been too soon after her last positive test    We had been sitting near this woman for  minutes already  so if there was a risk of exposure  the damage had been done   My mother decided to very dramatically lean away from the woman  and into my seat   doing nothing other than making a scene considering that moving   further away wasnt going to make her any safer   So I told her  hey  stop leaning into my seat    She got angry and told me to stop being so rude   and I should let her lean   I said she wasnt any safer leaning and was just calling attention to herself  and if she feels unsafe she should move to an empty seat farther away   She responded that she was there first  so I said  fine  take my chair then  and I got up to move farther away so she could have my seat   This  apparently  was the last straw of perceived disrespect for her   there was a lot more that happened on the trip but this is already long enough as is So  as we boarded our flight  I chatted with her a bit  or at least I thought I did  but she wasnt really engaging with me   We were in the same row on the flight  but siblingTwo was between us  so we didnt interact during the flight   When we landed in our home city  my mom rushed off the plane before most people had even stood up from their seats  and she dragged siblingTwo off with her   SiblingOne  their partner  and I  didnt manage to get off the plane for another several minutes   We expected to see them waiting for us at the gate  but instead they were rushing down the hallway towards Customs   It has been years since Ive come through my home city on an international flight  so what I didnt know at that time was that we would have to split up at customs  as there are different lines for connections and final destination arrivals   We were confused why they werent waiting  so we ran after them   Eventually we reached the point where I had to split off and my mom  looking very unhappy  and siblingTwo were standing there waiting   I said my goodbyes and made the rounds hugging everyone  prioritizing my mom  but she was very cold and her face and body language made it clear that she did not want to hug me and she didnt make an effort to return the hug   I went my separate way  amp  xB An hour later  I learned from siblingOne that once they were in their line  my mom had a  dramatic moment  saying we ruined the vacation for her  because  we acted like she couldnt do anything right and only  partners  parents were the good part  and she said  I should never go on vacation with my children again    Fortunately it seemed like siblingOne wasnt too bothered by the display but felt awkward since this was in front of their partner  and they knew that nothing they could say that wasnt a complete lie would make her happy   They pointed out that this vacation is not unique and these sorts of disagreements have always arisen on past vacations together and ignored her further complaints   So I apologized to siblingOne that they had to deal with that without me there but I was glad that they werent letting our mother get what she wanted  which was to try and spoil their trip in the way she felt it had been spoiled for her    We lamented that she was so dramatic but I wasnt too upset about it until today   This morning  I reached out to siblingTwo  because they live with her and I know how our mother can be  persistent and relentless   I worried that they would become the target for her unhappiness since they were alone with her   SiblingTwo told me they were fine  and that they were refusing to talk about about the issue with her because she was being ridiculous   Thats when they told me that she was  hyper fixated on what you did   ie  telling her not to lean into my seat  and that she said  OP doesnt care about us  and that she   tried to rush through the separation point at customs to avoid saying goodbye     SiblingTwo argued with her that she was being ridiculous and forced her to stop and wait for me   They asked me to let siblingOne know about this  since they hadnt talked about it yet and was exhausted from dealing with our mom   So that was why she ran off the plane and didnt wait  because she felt so slighted by me giving her a social correction that she wanted to leave without saying goodbye   And when siblingTwo tried to make her stop  she said that I dont care about them   The fact that she could say that I dont care  after all the behavior from her that I put up with and forgive  and all the uncomfortable things Ive done to make her happy    I cant believe it   Last January her father died in her home country  and I dropped everything on a dime to purchase an expensive flight to be there for her and help her sort out the funeral because no one else would   She asked me to do the eulogy at his service because she didnt have the strength and I wrote and delivered it   She even BRAGGED about my beautiful eulogy and how much I helped her on this very same trip  only to turn around and tell siblingTwo that   I dont care about them     And to top it all off is the absolutely outrageous behavior of trying to run away in the airport to avoid saying goodbye   I feel like there are very few  if any  things a person could do to deserve being abandoned by a travel companion like that   Especially a mother to their own child   Its such a crazy thing to do that I honestly find the behavior concerning  but not more so than I am hurt by it     So thats the long and short of it   I want to send an email  addressing her trying to run away and talking shit about me to my siblings   I want to address her behavior and how it affects me   And I want to tell her she needs to change her behavior  ideally by seeking professional help  or we cannot have a relationship because she has hurt me too many times and I cant keep that energy in my life   I myself will be seeking therapy to talk through the damage she and my father have done because I clearly have a lot to unpack   But I need to set this boundary NOW and I have no idea what the best way to write it will be   I am giving my siblings a heads up about this  especially siblingTwo since they live with her  and letting them know that they can stay out of it if they are most comfortable that way and in that case  if she tries to bring it up to them  she will  they can absolutely say they dont want to talk about me with her and to stay firm   I worry most for siblingTwo in this scenario    amp  xB Thank you so much for any help and advice you might offer me,14392,2759

527,p7np4t,0,12,Considering showing my Nmom videos about narcissists so she can see herself Last night I got into a huge argument with her and it went how it usually does  I say some trauma that she has done to me in my past and she immediately says “I didn’t do that” “I don’t remember that”  So it’s like… instead of taking the person’s word for it… your child… that they have the memory… you just deny them any consoling or apologizing  Like it doesn’t matter that you don’t remember it    You did it and now I have ptsd and a bunch of other issues   Like my issues didn’t pop out of no where  And as soon as I say my trauma she has to come back with “well you were a bad kid so that’s what happened”  But it’s not even with the past my mom does this  she does it mid conversation  She will say something and I’ll ask for clarification of what she said  or repeat exactly what she said back to her and she will be like “I didn’t say that ” “That’s not what I said ” Then it will go into an argument of how my perceptions of her are wrong  she is into life coaching  and I’m seeing her through a filter of my past  But whenever she says something about me it’s the truth and I can’t deny it and it’s not a filter  But then when I tell her she denies my truth  she says that of course what she said about me was through her filter  And it’s just this huge back and forth about what she says and what she didn’t say and something that was true five seconds ago isn’t true more and no amount of talking it though will ever work  She will just deny deny deny everything I say and then be confused why I’m still upset  Since she is so into self help and life couching I want to show her a video of what narcissists are and how they act and their tactics so she can see herself  But I’m so scared that she will just use what she learns and accuse me of doing it,1846,367

529,p7nk2c,0,4,Finally accepting it as abuse I’ve known intellectually all these things for ages  I could even Name them  sometimes  with caveats  with a guilty little feeling  like I’m taking away from the „real“ victims  But recently  something changed  I can say that  I can name it all  and I just named it all in once like I started to these last few days  and I had to share it here  because I had to put it somewhere I was abused  I was emotionally abused  I am traumatised because he abused me emotionally  He is still terrorising me  threatening me  guilting me  I deserved none of this  and i deserved better  in fact  I should have learned unconditional love  and I was owed a chance to develop my own personality  I didn’t get any of this  I don’t know my own strengths realistically  I am afraid of the world and myself  and i am hobbled because I am traumatised because he is an abusive dipshit  And none of this should have happened to me  He had no right to do that I just  suddenly  managed to accept all that  No caveats  No excusing his behaviour  not even mentioning other people  or his other victims  or any positives  just  Acknowledging that he wronged me  And I cried a bit at that and I was angry and it felt good  in a weird way  to give all that a name  I don’t have to talk around it  He was wrong  he harmed me  there is ni excuse for what he did to me  and his feels like maybe I’m getting to this point of „grieving for the childhood you didn’t have“  but I am definitely getting to the point of „I   deserve   better“  not just „I need to leave to leave to function“  and that’s a relief even in the grief,1631,307

537,p7mnnd,0,2,Running away from home   Im sorry  thisll be quite long So Im posting here because my parents have toxic tendencies  including most probably narcissism For the past year Ive kept telling my mom I wanted to move out to be closer to university when school starts  Ive said a bunch of other reasons too  but Ive never said anything about leaving because of them A month and a half ago I brought the subject up again  and she refused to acknowledge it completely  But that didnt stop me from still planning my move  signing a lease for September  etc  Four days ago I told her again that I wanted to move and it was scandalous  She said horrible things to me like Im incapable of doing anything on my own  that I hate them and the rest of the family  that Im ungrateful  that I have no rights and that she wants me home where she can know everything I do  Among all her crying  she also said that she doesnt think Ill ever speak to her again if I move  and that she forbade me to move  Didnt understand why I  didnt understand  why moving wasnt allowed     And that if I leave  she wants this years tuition money back  I didnt even have the chance to tell her that I signed a lease  so I believe she thinks she won this round  She barely talked to me since then  only this morning did she say something remotely nice  Theres still some tension in the air I think  she probably has a feeling something is up  My moving date is on Wednesday  If I tell her the day before that Im leaving no matter what she says  itll create scandals and I wont be allowed to take furniture  etc  Even though its an option  its a lot of hassle so I was thinking of just leaving while my parents are at work and be able to keep my furniture  Id leave them a letter explaining the same thing that Ive explained before  and that Im certain that Im ready and that I hope eventually my mom will understand  Also adding that we should not communicate for a while  except maybe email  and that afterwards we could think about doing calls and visits  Obviously Ill block my parents and family friends everywhere  so no one will be able to guilt me or say some nasty things  As for the moving  Ive already packed and moved most of my belongings  I only have  boxes and furniture left to take  We have a h window on Wednesday to move  pieces and undo my bedframe  Since well be  people  I think it might be doable  Having  people load up the truck   people on the bedframe  and  people moving the rest of the things  helping me pack the last two boxes  Im still hella worried though  because what if one parent stays home that day  or comes home early  And whats my mom gonna do  Shes unpredictable  I changed shifts at work so in case she hunts me down  I wont work my usual  And everyone will be safe at work  And then what  I take a loan for school  no biggie  But then what if I cant live with roommates  Its my first time  And what if my mom never speaks to me again  quite ironic because thats one of her biggest fears  Its in the top  biggest things Ive ever done in my life  but I dont feel much about it  Except that Im goddamn fearful of the unknown Any thoughts,3207,600
538,p7mkla,0,6,I think moving back with Nparents has made things worse  I moved back in with my Nparents last May after graduating and it has really messed with my mental health  I made so much progress in therapy while I was away but now I’m back to disassociating  barely eating  mild hallucinations  etc  I was on my way back from a job interview today and got into a wreck on the tollway  I didn’t even know how I hit the other person’s car  I think I was disassociating again  I’m terrified of doing that again and hurting someone and I plan to see a therapist about it  I’m just afraid of getting my license taken away because it will be harder for me to find a job and move out  I really feel that if I wasn’t living with my parents right now  my mental health wouldn’t be so bad and I wouldn’t be so scared of this happening,820,158

540,p7mfg3,0,2,Need advice  Been with my narc parents for  years now when I should have left  What should I do now   Fixed my post  Im mad at myself for not sticking to my principles and accepting their bad behavior  But I had no outside support  lost contact with all my high school and college friends  and no money saved up  So I stayed with them after knowing what they did was wrong  Here is a list     Lied about my college arrangements    Moved to a different state  I ended up losing my car  my computer  my video games  lost the chance to be with the girl I was in love with  and I burned through my    saved up because of their lies and broken promises  After staying in a dorm for a year  they broke their promise of allowing me to stay in an apartment and sent me back to the dorms  This was all done on purpose to control me  I soon became depressed and dropped out       Kicked me out of the house and made me homeless    unless I begged for forgiveness   After a road trip thinking about things  I confronted my mother in a kind  reasonable way saying     You know  youve always acted like there was something wrong with me  But I was never broken inside  I was fine the way I was     She then starts to scream at me like a crazy person and demands my house keys and says Im no longer allowed in the house  So I took another long road trip from Arizona to Florida  I ended up living with my grandpa in Texas and working for my aunt for a bit and my grandpa ended up driving me back to my parents  We never talked about that day     Constantly locates me with my phones and lies about it    About   years ago  Sprint had the family locator program  Since I was on their plan I would get a text message saying   You have just been located   When I confronted my parents about it they said   They just randomly send those to you   It doesnt matter how admit I am about the fact they JUST locating me  they give the same answer that they didnt  Honestly  I think this hurts the most  How can you treat someone like theyre that stupid  Even when I started to pay for my own plan  somehow I still that message when I left to Vegas without telling them     Pretended some girl who liked me  who I didnt like  was my girlfriend to the rest of the family    I was in church and   my mother introduced some girl to my grandma like she was my girlfriend  I even told my mother not to do this  The girl even played along  I didnt want to cause a scene in front of my grandma  so I was just quiet  I was thinking to myself  What the h ll is going on here      When I told them I was getting treated badly at my career job  they told me to ignore it and just work there for  years cause I would make a lot money    I think anyone who cared would tell you to find work somewhere else   I worked  various hourly jobs before that  so it wasnt just employees giving me a hard time  Im familiar with that  This was straight up abuse     When my brother was stealing my food  clothes  and   bills out of my wallet  they wouldnt confront him about it    They said you have no evidence so they wouldnt confront him  When I confronted him about it  he physically assaulted me  I called the cops and had him arrested  Then everyone in the family took his side     When I confront them about the past  they either wont apologize or say they dont remember and say  thats in the past  and to  get over it    I was a straight A student who my teachers and peers liked  I did all the extracurriculars and was accepted to all the colleges I applied to  So why the h ll would you start doing this to your son    I guess it was a control thing since they could no longer legally tell me what to do once I was  and going to college  That and a reputation thing since I was quiet  I feel like quiet to them equaled being less than everyone else as youre supposed to be perfect in every aspect including being extremely outgoing  And also a reputation thing that I didnt have a girlfriend yet despite having fallen in love with a girl in my hometown that my parents moved away from  This is the real problem    I cant stop thinking about this stuff   I wish I could move on but I cant  Unfortunately  I stayed with them for the last  years and drowned myself in self help to avoid the truth of my situation Actually  its been  years   year old going to college to now a soon to be  year old  since they started to treat me this way    is when I gave up on my career job and started to study and write self help and when I considered just leaving the whole situation      For the most part  the way they treated me came out of NOWHERE  I think thats why it hit me so hard and why Ive been trying to fix the relationship   And it seems like people in general are angry at me for staying with my parents and not working  I think thats also why I became a TI   I feel like thats an entirely different situation  but I also feel like its worth mentioning    I hate myself for staying there I need to move on  but the only way I can think to do that is to cut them out of my life So I have two options     Work while living with them and slowly move away      Just leave with what little Ive got  The problem is    Ive kind of tried both options already   For number one  I finally got my dream job while living with them  But every weekend when I had nothing to do and no one to hang out with besides my parents  I felt extremely empty inside  The job was ultimately unfulfilling because of that  and I ended up leaving  Then I  joined  the self help world industry which does seem to fill the void to a point  But I think it was just escapism from my real problems For number two  Ive  ran away from home  several times  several different ways since I was   I just never had that much money saved up when I did it   Never had more than that    saved up since college  I think my unhappiness causes me to spend money on things  I used my car to sleep in while I went to California probably  times  Couldnt get used to it  Tried to bike across the county three times and then tried walking across it twice  Gave up and went home every single time  Stayed a week at a Nevada hotel and at a California hotel to start my life over  Didnt work out  I cant think of all the ways  but Ive always gave up and came home I really dont know what to do with my life anymore  Im just out of an abusive  year narc relationship with my other grandpa  went back and forth between living with him and my parents  thought he was my ticket out of there  no idea he was also a narc till  years into it  but now Im permanently back here with my parents   What should I do now     P S    I think part of the problem is I do get along with my parents   to   of the time  My mom and I are pretty good friends  My dad and I are very much alike so I can relate to him  We live in a nice area and they always have good food to eat  Its hard to be angry enough at times to do something about the situation  I feel like Ive been lulled into comfortable resignation prison,7130,1345

545,p7m0y9,0,3,Gaining the courage to move out  m  Dont really know how to start this  but here goes my rantA while back I told both of my parents that I was planning on moving out when I had enough money for it to be a safe decision  At first  my mother blew up on me and told me that I was an awful and immoral person for doing that to her and that I should instead stay with her in her trailer to pay her bills  Her house is falling apart and its never been the best place to live  so I was super resistant to that idea  I posted about that whole mess here a while back and thanks to some kind users i know realize just how strange it is  So  flash forward  Im staying with my dad now but things arent much better to be frank   I simply dont have much of a life here as my dad expects me to be home whenever I can  Even then  its hard for me to do much as he gets upset with me whenever Im in my room alone  With all of that being said  I desperately want to move out and be an independent adult  However  my dad told me that he wants me to stay  for at least a year  or stay with him indefinitely  I fear that both of my parents are going to blow up on me should I decide to move out and its so hard to gain the courage to  just leave   I know I sound very whiny but this stress has been over my head practically all year now  Would I be awful for moving out before the one year mark  Should I even worry about that  How do I even negotiate this with my parents,1463,304

549,p7lieo,0,2,I turned  yesterday  my dad got me a letter begging me to come home  Things have gotten a lot better with my Dad since I moved out  hell my life has gotten a lot better since I moved out  Hes not a total narcissist  he has many narcissistic traits but I am lucky I can maintain a solid relationship with him when there have been times I would have gone no contact with him in a heartbeat  Still my stomach dropped when he couldnt get through the first page of the letter without a bit of cheeky parentification  some self victimisation and reminding me of everything hes sacrificed and that he views where I am now as a failure and a struggle It was so nice at first  but it just had to take a turn  Sorry if this upsets you  but Im your dad  will always be your dad and its not unreasonable for a dad to ask that time and again I resent many of his word choices  I try and read them from his perspective as an honest articulation of his feelings and thoughts  because god knows where else hes putting shit that honest out there  there are things he tells me he says he cant even tell his own wife I just wish he could talk about this  come home  shit just once and also acknowledge any of the reasons I left  Its not unreasonable to ask  but its unreasonable not to make an effort where Ive said it counts  Many things have changed in the past  years  but that  year old kid he told to leave  he told would never be called by his real name  then flipped his script and begged to come home knows that when he came back  nothing was really all that different  Fast forward to when Im   I explained very clearly  I explained why I was moving out  my reasons  in depth  I was transparent with them  I gave them weeks of notice after months of telling them I was planning on moving out at said time  They gave me a bombardment of vicious messages  hours before I got picked up with my stuff  my parents stonewalled me for a bit after I moved  The only person who accepted my  No  Im sorry but its not that simple  I cant just stay   and saw me off was my younger sister Does he think about my conditions  when he talks of the conditions of my return  Theyre the same as they were when I was   Ill come back when you go to therapy  Each year  at every opportunity I beg   Ive seen enough therapists  he says  not one of them being for his own issues except a short lived attempt at marriage counseling that he and my mother stopped once she suggested divorce  In fact part of why I moved out in the first place was to freely seek out therapy  something he had always sought to control to make sure no one was  encouraging her confusing   When I moved schools    s he cant see the counselor or join any programs without me being informed   When he found a letter referring me to an endocrinologist from our family doctor he took it without my permission and hid it in his wardrobe  I had been without psychological or regular psychiatric support for more than a year  an untreated BPD diagnosis that exploded under the pressure of that environment  and an attendance rate that was so low my father was getting warning letters that legal action may be taken against him  Every single meeting  I told my teachers I needed therapy  My dad told them hed arrange it  Id follow up on it  Nothing  Nothing since I refused to see do a program based on family therapy when I had my own psychological needs I was focused on  and that program didnt match them   I gave you the chance  you didnt want it I just feel so fucking unseen  God  what the fuck has all my honesty been for if hes just gonna fucking cry alone about it in his car  I have celebrated so many achievements since I moved out  moving out has been my greatest accomplishment  Everything Ive done since I moved out  each success  he does not celebrate the way he honours my  failures  with his tears I just wish theyd come over more  Were in lockdown right now so they cant  but my mother has never even seen my place most likely because shes not allowed to use his car or under his instructions  the car he bought for my sisters  My oldest sister has driven me home a couple of times but shes never even seen the place  I want them to see how it is  how nice weve made it  how proud I am  When did he forget When did he forget all the times he disappointed his father by honouring himself  Why cant he connect the dots and see hes projecting part of his unresolved issues with his father and fear of breaking social expectations onto me  Does his family even know Ive moved out  Ah well  I know he pushes me away when he is panicked  Hes scared hes lost me because hes lost his legal power over me  He fears Ive been as strong in my convictions as he knew I was all along It is painful  but this is his version of love  This is what it looks like  I am so loved by him though  so loved  When I can break through his walls and we can laugh and talk and spend time with eachother its so nice  Moving out has given me the power to back up my boundaries with consequence  I no longer have to put myself in situations I am not comfortable  One day we will love eachother more healthily  If only he could accept all of me  the way I have been told I must try to with him my whole life,5313,1000
550,p7lhzr,0,5,nParent Disowned Us M here  recently my father was caught cheating on my mother for a rd time  He then proceeded to tell my mother that she was a useless bitch   even though he doesnt have a job  he threatened to make her  rot in jail  and that he was going to make sure that she was left with nothing in her life  I decided to stop talking to him and he knocks on my room asking me why I refuse to talk to him  I then told him that he had said fucked up things to my mother and that I was cutting contact with him  He then tried to make me feel guilty by saying    I hope that it isnt too late when you want to talk to me again   implying that he could die or something  He also said that this was a fight between my mother and him and that it shouldnt concern me  He told my mother that he didnt consider his two daughters as his anymore  he said that I was in the  middle  because he saw that I was growing distant from him  What do you guys and gals think about this  Does he meet the criteria for a narcissist,1022,209

563,p7k82c,0,2,Take advantage of the surrender tactic When  it comes to a narcissist  they have huge egos  a weakness that can be  exploited  You might not be able able to escape from the narcissist  due  to either financial or logistical reasons  This is the source of most  of their power  This is a post on how to deal with them for the time  being for maximum gains What  I recommend is adopting a strategic approach when it comes to dealing  with them  Give them a false sense of security  Its okay to lose  battles if you eventually win the war  These battles or better yet   losses  usually end up being having to abide by their  rules   deferring  to their authority  or giving them a feeling of control over us   Nothing wrong with any of this if it will be beneficial to you in the  long run  I know its silly  as if Im telling you to not have  boundaries but I want you to look at it as trading space for time  Let  them think they are winning  when in reality you are secretly advancing   in this case  working towards your independence   According to Sun Tzu   When you are weak  make your enemies think you are strong  when you are  strong  make them think you are weak  when you are in retreat make them  think you are advancing and when you are advancing  make them think you  are in retreat  The art of deception One  way to do this by not arguing with them  no displays of anger  I know  they can really piss one off but if they are in your presence under no  circumstance should you show that you are pissed off  because for one   it achieves nothing and doesnt help you at all in your eventual goal of  escaping  Two  it lets them know what makes you tick  which is valuable  info to them for future purposes  Last but definitely not least   arguing is taxing on your mental health Understand  that the narcissist wants you depressed and running in circles  They  will try to start petty battles all for the sake of mentally  exhausting distracting you  Never justify yourself to them  if they  criticize something you did  ignore them  they are trying to get you to  explain yourself  as if youre somehow guilty of being human  They do  this to start arguments and also to maintain their  holier than thou   image  giving you the illusion that they themselves are perfect As  you know they have huge egos  You must exploit this whenever you can   Give them the feeling of victory  thats all they live for after all   Feed their ego by agreeing with them  asking for their opinion on  something  the news is good for this   dulling your talents or by giving  the appearance of finally devoting yourself to their cause  themselves   It might be hard to do this  but the hardest things usually have the  best returns of investment in life  They will stop being hostile   aggression is usually fueled by more aggression and when you stop giving  them fuel  which is why I must stress the importance of not engaging in  arguments with them  never show that you are angry   they will leave  you alone  giving you time and mental fortitude to plan your escape from  their toxic regime  There is no shame in surrendering to fight another  day  Better that than to be a martyr  pertaining to narcissistic  parents  this might mean being kicked out or being physically assaulted   You might live in a democratic society but let us not fool ourselves   narcissists are dictators  You are the country under a colony but on a  much smaller scale Another  instance where you might want to employ your cunning is whenever they  pester you with questions  Not all interrogators wear uniforms  Conceal  your intentions by giving them false information  If you say nothing at  all are being secretive  it will alert them that you are on a defensive   making them unpredictable  an undesirable outcome  Ive seen people  mention grey rocking on here  based on my understanding  it involves  avoiding the narcissist or giving them very short responses  Take it  further by employing the strategy I just mentioned  remember  you want  them to think you are on their side Now  if youve done all of that successfully  the narcissist will leave you  alone  Suddenly youre not mentally drained from pointless arguments and  can now focus all your energy on making money  They say money cant buy  happiness but it definitely buys freedom  a prerequisite to happiness   Develop a framework to start earning money  I must put emphasis on this   focus on making money  it is the key to your independence  It could be a  job or selling whatever skill you might have  as long it makes you  money  Save aggressively  If you remember what I said about being  pestered with questions  youll know to deflect with false information   It might be impossible to conceal a job  but its not hard to tell them  youre earning a figure much lower than the actual one  Money is power  in its purest form and will give you the ability to say  fuck you  to  anything in life  the ability to walk away Ive  seen posts here that suggest moving out  which I agree with  moving out  should be priority number one but some of them fall short on the how   Hopefully this can be a guide to some on what actions they can take that  towards achieving their independence,5248,987

kids in the house with their room decorated  I had to share a bed with them    that hurt and I cried a lot    fast forward   I am moving with him now to a whole different state alone at    this time around I move in with him his new wife and  kids    it was weird to me how he could have a whole other family and just not even be able to talk to me    since I already didn’t know him well I remember constantly just sitting in my room and never coming out   I peed in a cup and washed clothes in my tub   as I started high school I played sports and got along with people well    my freshman year my dad eventually got deployed so I had to stay with my new step mom  which cause me to rebel but nothing major  I’d just hang after school longer sometimes and not tell where I was at  My dad came back my sophomore year and I struggled with my grades which made him eventually angry  He took my phone and went through messages  he seen me and my friends messages   We were really just being teens we cussed a little  he had an outburst and flipped my whole room which scared me and resulted me to want to go back home   Mind you we still don’t have much of a relationship or talk  I figured he was just disciplining me as a parents   Moved back with mom  she bribed me with things to get me to stay  Eventually my grades weren’t up to par  my moms husband intervened and took my phone and told me I couldn’t contact my dad    when at this time I was supposed to go visit him for holidays  I eventually began to bump heads with my mom because she let him control not only me but her    I had to leave     went back to live with dad   he is now divorced  never tells me why  but now I come back and my dad is single again so a lot of the times now I was resulted to being home alone my dad went out so I just eventually started to hang out with friends   and do my own thing and this was my senior year of highschool so I got some leeway    I remember one day getting a call while at school mentioning that my mom had been beaten my her husband   i became very furious   my mom didn’t leave and i gained some hatred towards her and stay away from her home for awhile   eventually after I graduate which is    I’m working and having fun and on the go and really my dad is to  We don’t ever see each other    this is our new normal    we did have sit down talks from time to time but they were like long life lectures nothing reasonable  I remember Jan   I get a call from my sister saying that my mom has been beaten again and I grow angry and a lot of anger for her husband but she doesn’t leave    mind you this man has never apologized and my mom gets angry at us for being angry at him    I just become such an angry person    a little later   I began to date a guy who was emotionally unavailable and used me for sex  got me pregnant had an abortion  i paid for it alone  had nobody there for me not even the guy  amp  never told anybody    I feel because I had nobody he really comforted me  despite how he treated me  I continued to date him  pay for his stuff and everything  I was manipulated and didn’t know  Eventually I got tired and decided to leave but he continued to beg me to stay so I did  Later finding out he was having sex with  other girls and one also had an abortion   But that didn’t stop me I still dealt with him it was hard to let go    about a year later I ended up pregnant again and had another abortion and I just felt horrible and spiraled downhill   my mental health dropped a lot   I stopped having motivation to work   became an alcoholic  used drugs  my self esteem was down  started losing friends  I looked for validation within men so much  I let them use me for my body thinking it was ok    I grew way more distant from my dad and angrier with him because he was right there but couldn’t even tell  I eventually became suicidal and started to confess it to my parents because I was scared and got sent to a mental hospital  Within that time I had therapy appointments but refused to go  had to take medicine but refused to take it because I was scared to become addicted    now I just am at an all time low   my dad gets angry for me always staying in my room  And we start to bump heads to the point that we eventually got into a physical altercation   I take a break go to my moms for a week and I was very low and sad    I didn’t talk or eat I lost about   in  month    her husband approaches me and asks why I don’t love him which results to me having an outburst throwing things  amp  explaining to him that he’s beaten my mom  He laughs in my face   amp  my mom doesn’t do much  She just ask what did I do to help the situation    few months later aka now my dad kicks me out for a month until finding out I’ve been in a car accident and been sleeping in my car  He let me back in but now I’m just  really insecure   I’ve lost many friends  haven’t been able to maintain a job  and have so much still going on  It’s hard for me to because I’ve lost trust in a lot  In myself   I feel like I’ve became narcissistic or selfish or something  I’ve lost friends  My parents have never apologized to me about the abuse and a lot of stuff just has to get swept under the rug  I know this is long and This is not even it all  I’ve dealt with so much and now i don’t know how to deal with the real world  I am scared  my siblings go with the flow and I just can’t  I want to move out   away   amp  on and be independent with life but I cannot seem to let go of alot  I am  now and currently cannot continue to a therapist for awhile  I really try to pull through  I don’t understand what’s wrong with me and idk what to do,7852,1576

566,p7jv0c,0,4,Finally went NC    I finally blocked my parents for good about a week ago and it feels amazing  I have put them on time out temporarily blocked them before but this time I have no hope of us reconciling and I dont want to try  I was sick of continuing the cycle of abuse and I want to be done with it for good and never go back  I had so much guilt leading up to it and thought I would have so much guilt after I did it  I did have some guilt at first but I just reminded myself of why Im doing it and it is mostly gone now except for when I hear from some flying monkey siblings  Mostly I feel so happy  free  relieved  peaceful  relaxed    I truly feel like a different person  I hope I can keep it up  I plan to  I just wanted to share in case anyone is on the fence about going NC  come to the bright side  it is so much better over here Thanks for listening  much love to all,889,179
567,p7jmev,0,3,My nMom has had multiple affairs and expects me to keep her secret from my dad  who I love very much  I dont really post  so Im sure its got errors  but I just needed to get it out My m step dad married my f mom and legally adopted f me when I was five  and it was probably the best thing that could have happened to me  My mom is a raging narcissist  but covers it pretty well in public  and just shows it privately to a few of us  lucky  family members  mainly my step dad and myself  She cheated on my step dad probably  years ago with my biological dad  and it was a mess  They separated  I hated it  Then she realized she was going to have to actually work if she didnt have financial support  so she went back to my step dad  For a while there  she  found Jesus  and I think she mellowed out a little bit  but around her th birthday  something snapped  and she decided that she was going to do what she wanted  screw everyone else  She left my dad to run an extremely demanding business by himself at   yrs old  while she visits  best friends  or  works  hours away  and Im left to help him on my days off  after working all week This has been going on for years  and Im done  She never suffers any consequences to her actions  Im tired of running her business  while lying to my dad and pretending I dont know anything about the multiple affairs that she has had and then outright told me about  She thinks I empathize with her because shes  bored  He deserves better than this  but I dont think I should have to be the one to tell him  Hes almost  years older than she is  and I think he is afraid of being alone this late in life  but wouldnt you want to know  Wouldnt you rather be alone than with someone who cares nothing for you  How do I resolve this without putting myself directly in the middle of it  Its causing me severe anxiety and depression and I am just ready to scream it at the top of my lungs and walk away Ive started writing a letter  but I dont even really know where to start,2044,388

570,p7jgch,0,39,Does my Dad sound like an abuser  So currently Im on a trip to the beach with my parents that I didnt actually want to go on and Id been telling them all week leading up to it that I didnt want to go but they kept insisting I was  Then yesterday morning it comes time to leave for the trip and I told them again I didnt want to go and they should leave without me  So my Dad keeps telling me Im going and I keep saying Im not going and eventually he crawls under my desk and yanks all the wires out of the wall to my computer  lamps  etc  Then grabs me by the wrist and tells me  Get ready to go now or shit is gonna get ugly,634,133
571,p7jfs6,0,4,My mother gets a kick out of provoking me and then revels in my frustration In my st year of college  but at this point  I’m close to moving out  This has been an issue pretty much my whole life  with her complete inability to accept responsibility   even to my dad  as he revealed  or apologize even when the evidence is clear as day  My dad  working through the summer  is frequently gone from the house  which leaves me alone with her when I’m not working myself  During these days  I have been locked out on the back porch and told to sleep outside  because I came back  minutes late  have had my possessions stolen from my room   amp  many other negative interactions over the course of the summer   only getting worse   Today’s incident was relatively minor  though her reaction definitely aggravated the situation greatly  after spending the night at a friends house  I returned home to try and get back some sleep  as I hadn’t slept very well there  As soon as my mother hears that I am attempting to rest  she immediately bolts downstairs to get out her instruments  we are a musical family  in order to wake me up as loudly as she can  I later find out that she had absolutely no reason to “practice”  her justification   and the only reason she was even playing was in order to get me as angry as possible  When I realized this  I go downstairs to ask her nicely to consider “practicing” later  to which she returns a smirk and the classic narcissistic laugh  indicating she felt zero remorse and even enjoyed watching my visible frustration  Following this  she begins blatant gaslighting  “you sound crazy  you look out of control  etc” This kind of thing happens constantly and she seems to be getting worse and the summer winds down  It’s never been this bad  and I am currently wondering what I did in a past life to deserve this  She is  and acts like a dramatic th grader  I partially understand  seeing as her childhood household was chaotic  but it’s more than obvious that she knows full well what she’s doing TLDR  my mother calculates specific ways to get under my skin  and then delights in my reactions,2135,380
572,p7jem8,0,3,Im afraid that the path Im headed down is going to kill me  I need someone to talk to   TW  To preface  I know this may not be the most appropriate sub for this  I do have NParents  but this is more of a support seeking post for all of my issues and not just that one  since I dont think I could separate them even if I tried  Im a little bit desperate to be heard and to find someone to talk to so I hope its okay to post here this once  since itll be seen by more people than any related sub I feel so completely broken that Im not sure where to begin in asking for help  I have been through things that I would never wish on anyone and Im running out of ways to cope that wont put me in the ground  When talking to a friend stopped working years ago  I turned to self injury  That stopped working  so I turned to flat out denial  From there  it became promiscuity  And then drugs  and then alcohol  and then more severe self injury and now harder drugs  Im realizing that Im going to die if I dont help myself  and despite many years of suicidal impulses and fantasies  the thought of dying on any terms other than my own is terrifying Ive been through many professionals  I have a loving boyfriend and one or two patient friends  No family  though  And I think the two things that I desperately need  which have been missing from everything Ive tried and failed to find comfort in in the past  are  a  a person who understands on a personal level because theyve been there  and  b  a person who has that whole maternal  protective thing that Ive never gotten to experience  I cant recall a time in my entire life that Ive felt protected  even as a young child  and I think it may help me give a shit about saving my own life to believe that Im valuable enough to someone to be worth protecting If anyone at all feels like talking  I would be very grateful  I just ask that you be woman identified  non religious  and non judgmental of the things Ive had to do in order to survive  Ill also leave a heavy trigger warning here for severe child abuse  of all types   rape  self injury  suicide  and substance abuse,2143,396
573,p7jc2l,0,6,I hate living here  sorry if this is incoherent So two days ago  i wanted to have some olive oil for breakfast then dad yelled at me for taking another bottle than the one he wanted me to  So mom told him it was fine then he yelled at her that its none of her business and to shut up  Mom is  and hes  So mom packed her clothes and went to her parents house and the next day  he bought himself breakfast and didnt get any for me or my sister  there was nothing to eat at home   So we took a taxi to stay with mom  And then he took the car to his sisters home  shes very toxic  misogynistic  and hateful towards mom  And he didnt call me or any of my siblings  He has no health issues except diabetes and when he got it he blamed it on us  and so he started yelling at us everyday  Mom has huge health issues yet she does all the housework  he treats her like his maid  calls her stupid and hes never happy neither with her or us One day I asked if I could drink a cup of juice we had at home  and he told me no since we already eat too much  I dont eat a lot at all   whenever I try to fill my water bottle  hell tell me I should leave the water for him  Whenever I eat in front of him  he glares at me  Were not that poor  we have a big house and can afford basic things at least  In March  I wanted to go leave and live in the streets  he didnt hold me and watched her fight with me because of him and he was laughing  its always the same silence treatment method since Ive been a kid  he would just watch me beg him to talk to me and cry for that  and he would tell me to go away and that I am worthless and all that even if I get the best grades and do all he wants  When Im sick  i dont go to a doctor  and i dont have pocket money to do it myself  Ive been suffering from deficiencies all this year and they only took me to a doctor when i had one month left for the exam I still remember one day he stopped talking to me and my siblings all at once for NO reason and when mom tried to intervene  he started with the  i CaN lEaVe tHiS hOuSe iF yOu wAnT  Now Im here at this house  having nowhere to sit alone  with kids yelling everywhere and no right for privacy  I cant even take a shower and I dont know if theyll divorce or not  and even if they do mom will probably blame it on me,2328,478
574,p7j1gp,0,3,Need advice  Been with my narc parents for  years now when I should have left  What should I do now  Im mad at myself for not sticking to my principles and accepting their bad behavior  But I had no outside support  lost contact with all my high school and college friends  and no money saved up  So I stayed with them after knowing what they did was wrong  Here is a list     Lied about my college arrangements    Moved to a different state  I ended up losing my car  my computer  my video games  lost the chance to be with the girl I was in love with  and I burned through my    saved up because of their lies and broken promises  After staying in a dorm for a year  they broke their promise of allowing me to stay in an apartment and sent me back to the dorms  This was all done on purpose to control me  I soon became depressed and dropped out       Kicked me out of the house and made me homeless    unless I begged for forgiveness   After a road trip thinking about things  I confronted my mother in a kind  reasonable way saying     You know  youve always acted like there was something wrong with me  But I was never broken inside  I was fine the way I was     She then starts to scream at me like a crazy person and demands my house keys and says Im no longer allowed in the house  So I took another long road trip from Arizona to Florida  I ended up living with my grandpa in Texas and working for my aunt for a bit and my grandpa ended up driving me back to my parents  We never talked about that day     Constantly locates me with my phones and lies about it    About   years ago  Sprint had the family locator program  Since I was on their plan I would get a text message saying   You have just been located   When I confronted my parents about it they said   They just randomly send those to you   It doesnt matter how admit I am about the fact they JUST locating me  they give the same answer that they didnt  Honestly  I think this hurts the most  How can you treat someone like theyre that stupid  Even when I started to pay for my own plan  somehow I still that message when I left to Vegas without telling them     Pretended some girl who liked me  who I didnt like  was my girlfriend to the rest of the family    I was in church and   my mother introduced some girl to my grandma like she was my girlfriend  I even told my mother not to do this  The girl even played along  I didnt want to cause a scene in front of my grandma  so I was just quiet  I was thinking to myself  What the h ll is going on here      When I told them I was getting treated badly at my career job  they told me to ignore it and just work there for  years cause I would make a lot money    I think anyone who cared would tell you to find work somewhere else   I worked  various hourly jobs before that  so it wasnt just employees giving me a hard time  Im familiar with that  This was straight up abuse     When my brother was stealing my food  clothes  and   bills out of my wallet  they wouldnt confront him about it    They said you have no evidence so they wouldnt confront him  When I confronted him about it  he physically assaulted me  I called the cops and had him arrested  Then everyone in the family took his side      When I confront them about the past  they either wont apologize or say they dont remember and say  thats in the past  and to  get over it    I was a straight A student who my teachers and peers liked  I did all the extracurriculars and was accepted to all the colleges I applied to  So why the h ll would you start doing this to your son    I guess it was a control thing since they could no longer legally tell me what to do once I was  and going to college  That and a reputation thing since I was quiet  I feel like quiet to them equaled retarded as youre supposed to be perfect in every aspect including being extremely outgoing  And also a reputation thing that I didnt have a girlfriend yet despite having fallen in love with a girl in my hometown that my parents moved away from  This is the real problem    I cant stop thinking about this stuff    I wish I could move on but I cant  Unfortunately  I stayed with them for the last  years and drowned myself in self help to avoid the truth of my situation Actually  its been  years   year old going to college to now a soon to be  year old  since they started to treat me this way    is when I gave up on my career job and started to study and write self help and when I considered just leaving the whole situation      For the most part  the way they treated me came out of NOWHERE  I think thats why it hit me so hard and why Ive been trying to fix the relationship   And it seems like people in general are angry at me for staying with my parents and not working  I think thats also why I became a TI   I feel like thats an entirely different situation  but I also feel like its worth mentioning    I hate myself for staying there I need to move on  but the only way I can think to do that is to cut them out of my life  So I have two options     Work while living with them and slowly move away      Just leave with what little Ive got  The problem is    Ive kind of tried both options already   For number one  I finally got my dream job while living with them  But every weekend when I had nothing to do and no one to hang out with besides my parents  I felt extremely empty inside  The job was ultimately unfulfilling because of that  and I ended up leaving  Then I  joined  the self help world industry which does seem to fill the void to a point  But I think it was just escapism from my real problems For number two  Ive  ran away from home  several times  several different ways since I was   I just never had that much money saved up when I did it   Never had more than that    saved up since college  I think my unhappiness causes me to spend money on things  I used my car to sleep in while I went to California probably  times  Couldnt get used to it  Tried to bike across the county three times and then tried walking across it twice  Gave up and went home every single time  Stayed a week at a Nevada hotel and at a California hotel to start my life over  Didnt work out  I cant think of all the ways  but Ive always gave up and came home I really dont know what to do with my life anymore  Im just out of an abusive  year narc relationship with my other grandpa  went back and forth between living with him and my parents  thought he was my ticket out of there  no idea he was also a narc till  years into it  but now Im permanently back here with my parents   What should I do now,6700,1262
575,p7itei,0,63,I was suicidal and checked myself into a psych ward several times last year  which is being used to call me  unstable  in court  and used to say my  abusive  parents need to keep me trapped under conservatorship   Basically the title  but I need to vent below   The first time I felt suicidal and was scared Id act on it  I tried to reach out to my parents for help  but they didnt take it seriously  So I checked myself into a psychiatric ward voluntarily so Id get help and wouldnt impulsively commit suicide   Then I went into Outpatient  and sent an email to my mother standing up for myself and setting a healthy boundary  My mother made a passive aggressive Facebook post that day  basically using FB instead of directly responding to me  She shared somebodys post that said  if you dont heal what hurt you  youll bleed on people who didnt cut you   tagged me and said  I know this   Because this post was my mothers subtle way of rejecting my boundary and claiming  I  was the one unfairly bleeding on  her   because I was tagged I felt publicly humiliated   and  because I had a history of cutting as self harm in the past  which my mother  knew  about   this triggered me to feel suicidal and want to kill myself with a razor  I felt frightened I wouldnt be able to keep myself safe  spoke up  and got ed again   The last time I got ed is because my mother abused her powers of conservaotrship over me  and it was my breaking point  My mother has medical conservatorship and access to my confidential records  She got access to my trauma informed therapists confidential records and discovered I dislocsed her abuse to this therapist  and this therapist believed me  My mother then used her medical power of conservaotrship to pull me out of therapy  without warning me or the therapist  She also pulled me out of psychiatry because the psychiatrist I had was co workers with the therapist   This frightened and devastated me  These professionals were the only ones who recognized I had PTSD due to my mothers abuse  everyone else my abusive parents hired for me basically gaslit and invalidated and mis diagnosed me   I realized that as long as my mother had medical and confidential records powers  Id never get trauma informed therapy with competent therapists again  because my mother would simply pull me out of therapy like she did with that team  And that as long as she had this power and control over me  id see therapists and psychiatrists whod continue to gaslight and invalidate me over my parents abuse and maybe even my PTSD diagnosis Yet the fact I was brave enough to get ed and reach out for professional help is being used to call me  unstable  in court  The court investigator himself believes this and said because Im  unstable  he believed my parents should remain conservators and I shouldnt be allowed to petition to end the conservatorship Yet theres no acknowledgement that the reason Im so unstable felt suicidal is mainly  because  Im going through conservatorship abuse and narcissistic abuse  and suicide felt like my only way out  And with them saying me getting ed makes me unstable  I feel Im being sent the message the next time I feel actively suicidal  its apparently better for me to just risk killing myself instead of recognizing the danger and reaching out for help  I dont care if they mean to send this message  this is the message Im getting loud and clear  and it upsets me  pisses me off  and feels dehumanizing Yet suicide awareness suicide prevention  advocates  doing what I did  calling a suicide hotline or telling mental health professionals if youre actively suicidal  even if that means getting hospitalized  I did what anti suicide campaigns  claim  is the  right thing to do   but its being used against me in court  How fucked up is that,3867,649
576,p7ioet,0,3,The most painful is to see that they are happy  and that they will never give a shit  because life actually always favouritises evil Im just depressed as of now  Ive had multiple narcs in my life at the same time  Family  friends  and every partner so far  Now for a while all the fake friends and abusive partners have been cut off   have left  Family ones are still there  but I have a safe person to flee to in case things go haywire again  I cannot give more details for my own safety  but at times my life nearly got threatened But now  I am observing from afar those people  And I just see them enjoy life  They literally never have any problem  Despite being stupid and evil they never get sick  they never have accidents  they never lose a job  Most people they interact with actually side with them when our matters are concerned I just struggle now  To know that there wont be any justice  They wont ever pay for what they did  If anything  I am now       certain they will actually bury me first  They stole all my fuel  let me an empty damaged wreck  and now they can just go for the next target  while I will probably never recover  I had been abused in my childhood by many people  but they were strangers  so actually now  I dont care  Strangers cant hurt me anymore  One more bullet  or one less  does not make a difference  But family   friends      I still cant digest it  The betrayal     is just so high  Its unbearable     I just stay because I dont want to hurt my few real friends     can anyone relate to similar stuff with narcs  I post here  because the ones who wounded me the most  are my parents  They were the first  of many narcs that came after them  each one shelling and inflicting damage,1746,321
577,p7ilgc,0,5,Recovery as an RBN is a slow bumpy road but Im so proud of the progress were all making  I was looking back at some old diary entries  I never used to journal as a kid because nmom one time found my diary and read my entries out loud to the whole family  sniggering the entire time  but as an adult it has been very helpful   I read an entry I wrote in the  pre enlightenment  era  when I didnt realise how toxic my parents were and was so sad to see some of the stuff I wrote in there  I was telling myself to open up to my mom and connect more to her  blaming myself for her unavailability and her critical nature where she weaponizes anything I say that makes opening up to her not only impossible but also UNSAFE   I had such bad fleas  where I felt super jealous of my sister for getting private tennis lessons whereas my nparents actively discouraged me from doing sports  infamously  nmom told me the day I told her I wanted to join the track and field team   You will quit in a couple days    dumping my resentment and anger about the whole situation on my sister rather than my nparents  where it truly belonged  And now  about   years later   Im still on the journey to healing and actively working on processing a lot of stuff from my childhood  but I am so  so much better  I am so much kinder to myself  The inner critic that my parents installed in me from an early age is softer  When it starts criticising me  I tell it to shut up  I am kinder to other people than I was before  because I dont dump unresolved anger and resentment onto them as often  I wanted to make this post to encourage all of you out there who are feeling hopeless  who are feeling like fleas will never get better  They will  Give it time  give it energy  Give it lots and lots of therapy  Healing from the wounds our nparents gave us is not easy at all  and I think of all the accomplishments in my life  the amount of progress Ive made on healing is definitely   Youre making progress  Youve got this,2007,380
578,p7ijxz,0,25,Does financial control ever end  My whole life  F  has been based on threats and discouragement  Every time I accept a “gift” or financial help from my ndad  there’s always a catch and that’s to do what he says  When I suggest something not according to his plan for my life  he makes sure to tell me how bad my life will be  And it’s all under the guise of “knowing what’s best”  I have to return to work to afford moving out  but he says I can’t do that based on an ‘agreement’ we had  I dont remember being told that if i accepted the help with paying off a loan  I cant get any job outside of what my parents say is acceptable  I need income to move out  He knows that  “Well  we’ll just help you with any costs you can’t cover with what’s in your bank account now  Don’t spend any more money ” I don’t want him to help me with moving because the cycle will just continue  But I have to leave for my mental health I can’t set boundaries  I can’t grey rock or do any therapeutic shit because it never works  I’m steamrolled by my ndad and my possible nmom just sits and watches  It feels like I will be financially controlled for the rest of my life,1159,223

584,p7i1re,0,11,My mom used my siblings and I to get famous our whole childhood and exploits us now  Growing up my Mom was always trying to be rich and famous  She would make my siblings and I write letters to tv shows to try to get her on  We had to package  address and mail her latest get rich quick idea often throughout our childhood and she called us her little worker bees On summer vacations she would have us wear a t shirt to try to sell her product  Our family vehicle was also constantly decaled with her product She did not have a regular job so it always felt like if we didnt support her latest get rich quick idea we would be even more poor  Sometimes she would donate thousands of her product to try to get publicity leaving us even more poor than we were Later as adults   family trauma occurred and she convinced that family member to write a book about it  She guilted everyone into our family and to writing a chapter and then tried to get us all to go on Dr Phil and exploit the situation further so that she could become famous She somehow has the belief that if other people think shes a good person theyll give her lots of money and shell be rich   Im only now realizing this could fall under narcissistic She doesnt meet the exact definition of narcissist  does anyone know what this diagnosis would be,1328,245

586,p7hv8b,0,2,No win situations with Narcissist or Toxic Parents Family Members  Non stop shame  guilt  and self hatred  and feelings of helplessness I apologize if this post sounds enabling  invalidating  or excusing narcissistic abuse  I just feel really helpless right now  as I feel that my parents toxic behaviour is doing a number on my sanity  despite me trying to emotionally detach and improve myself in a healthy  constructive  and empathetic way  In this post  I just want to rant and vent about my situation  as I have a very enmeshed and dysfunctional family which I dont know how to articulate with words  but i apologize because i do not mean to sound like i am excusing toxic behaviour or insulting  blaming  and generalizing about groups of people My malignant narcissist father punishes me for emotionally detaching from his narcissistic bullying  or for simply showing cognitive empathy for other people  Yet my malignant narcissist dad has the nerve to justify his self absorbed  egomaniacal behaviour as  the way it is   that his behaviour is somehow the way the  Real world is   or somehow my fault for not  letting it go   Therefore  every interaction I have is a lose lose situation  if I play along with his narcissist bullying  gaslighting  self absorption   and love bombing  in order to keep the peace with him and get him off my back   i feel like I am internalizing and justifying his toxic behaviour  giving him more power over my self worth  and letting his fucked up view of the world determine my life  But if I choose not to care what he thinks by grey rocking him  he acts victimized while antagonizing me at the same time  criticizes me for supposedly  being spoiled  or  not doing anything   or he tries to control me even more  While nothing would please me more than cutting my ties with him and his toxic family  I am afraid of the social fallout  simply liking therapy posts on Instagram is enough to wound my fathers ego  and not being friends and liking his toxic family members posts is also enough to slight him  as my dad cares about sacrificing my mothers  my sisters  and my own self respect in order to make himself look  altruistic  and  selfless  to his psychopath family members  Ironic  because my dad is a self righteous  insecure  mentally unstable  delusional  narcissistic piece of human shit  whom thinks hes entitled to destroy the happiness and dreams of his own family members    and unfortunately moving out is not an option for me as of now  as i do not have enough money and mentally i feel like my dad was right about me  not being able to handle the real world   being confident is not an option as my dad mocks me for doing so  but he acts like an unstable psychopath if i stand up to him and call him out for it  and emotionally manipulates me for not talking to him if hes my friend  I just feel so conflicted because whenever I have emotionally broke down and put myself down by apologizing and insulting myself for being  worthless  or being  mentally broken   my narcissist dad would  build me back up   this always felt manipulative and just to bolster his own delusional ego  saying  youre not worthless   but if I tell him I feel like Im always digging myself a hole  then hell say  well then stop digging    I cant have normal conversations with people because my toxic parents insist on me and my sister talking to them as if theyre our friends  yet if we dont talk to them like theyre our friends  theyll act offended without admitting it  While I appreciate being provided food and shelter by my parents  Even though I rationally believe that this is a minimum requirement and not a fuckign excuse for toxic behaviour  my dad frequently buys me pointless gifts in which he uses to control me emotionally by pretending that my identity is like that and getting offended if I disagree with him  weirdly enough  he used to  not like it  if I thanked him when i was younger by saying to me  were family  we dont need to thank each other   Yet  nowadays  he acts entitled to me thanking him in a scared  childlike tone of voice  as he acts threatened if I do not thank him for him doing shit i can either easily do myself or for doing things I never wanted him to do for me  I do not want anything from him  yet he loves to pretend that I am spoiled  If I thank him in a confused or unenthusiastic tone of voice  although im lucky he doesnt rage as often as he did when i was younger  he gaslights me by saying that if i am in a bad mood i should take  natural supplements   The worst part is  I dont know anymore if my dad is right  seeing how due to my cowardice to stand up to his fucked up behaviour back when I was a teen  I always sound out of touch  overly apologetic  childlike  and hypersensitive whenever someone talks down to me  laughs at me  or angrily criticizes me  but I dont want to turn into my toxic dad or toxic mother to cope  Although I feel sorry for how my malignant narcissist dad and his family treat her  I feel that she does not give me healthy feedback at all  she either infantilizes me like a fucking baby who cant do no wrong and lovebombs me  pressures me for  not telling her everything   acts offended if I simply speak normally and confidently  or she gives really passive aggressive  unclear guilt trips to shame me  Without admitting it of course   My mother runs a home daycare  in which she treated me like a golden child in front of the other kids  which always made me feel deep shame seeing how despite her caring about their physical wellbeing  she never had an issue with shaming them  emotionally manipulating them  and emotionally abusing them  Although Ive tried to show the kids there compassion as much as Ive could  I hate myself for being too much of a coward to report her  due to being afraid of  disrupting the peace  at home  I cant call out my mother  as she frequently acts as if Im oppressing her if im merely trying to stand up to her toxic actions  I feel sorry for my mothers lack of confidence  abuse she went through  and low self esteem  but i do not sympathize with her toxic behaviour towards her daughter and to the kids she takes care of While my sister does validate some of the toxic behaviour my parents have done  such as my fathers mentally unstable  psychopathic  and narcissistic rages  my parents racist and sexist insults or  jokes   my mothers emotional abuse of the children at her daycare and of her daughter  some of my fathers weird gaslighting remarks   my sister unintentionally excuses my fathers and mothers narcissistic behaviour  gaslights me  gives me contradictory feedback  if i beat myself up and put myself down when talking about negative interactions with people  shell give me supportive but constructive feedback  and at times overly sympathize with me  if i try to speak confidently about my negative interactions with my narcissist dad  shell criticize me for  seeing the worst in people   My dad punishes me for grey rocking him by blaming me for  not caring  or treating me as if Im somehow abusing him  thus  he assigns me pointless chores to soothe his ego  acts passive aggressive  belligerent  and offended if I dont discuss my hobbies with him  seeing how he always uses them either to brag to his toxic family  or to mock me or  praise  me if theyre hobbies he likes make him  look  good  He likes to pretend hes a fucking drill sergeant  except he was in the military for a couple of years and everything he does is to bolster his own ego  tear down our social boundaries and makes us feel inadequate and insecure in front of toxic people or simply mean and difficult people rather to make us  tougher  and more  disciplined   seeing how my dad is triggered by me and my sister not giving af about his toxic behaviour and what he thinks    The worst part is  I have no clue if my malignant narcisist dads gaslighting and abuse is somehow  right   I cant even tell the difference between toxic gaslighting bullying or genuine attempts at friendly joking  teasing  banter  or constructive criticism  At my high school and university  i remember always feeling triggered and insecure of what teachers  professors  and teaching assistants thought about and currently think of me  as some of them did things that always felt the same as how my dad wouldve treated me and other people  For example  I would always get triggered by their  jokes   about how students were somehow  spoiled  or believed that  teachers professors teaching assistants  were  out to get them   I would also get offended if people with authority would make sarcastic and or condescending remarks  or make comments that I would feel that were emotionally manipulative  e g  once i could not tell if my professor was joking or genuinely being mean spirited when he bitterly criticized the class during lecture for supposedly having  messy handwriting   saying  we  professors  have feelings too   some people in the class laughed  but i could not tell if they were doing this because they were nervous  they were scared of being mocked by the professor  they wanted to laugh along the professor  or if they were trying to put down their fellow students   I cant have a normal conversation with my fellow students without feeling nonstop shame and that I need to over apologize  because if i dont apologize then i feel like i sound narcissistic myself when i simply try to speak normally and confidently Sorry if this post doesnt make any sense  anyways thanks for reading this post and hope everyone is taking care and doing well,9623,1673

595,p7hd8z,0,2,Just came to the realization of being raised by narcs  but can’t tell if it’s one parent or both Long post incoming  I’ve been trying to learn more about narc parents after coming to the realization that I grew up as a scapegoat  but Im having trouble now identifying which parent is the narc enabler or are they just both narcs  My brain feels like it’s just getting pulled in all kinds of different directions right now trying to figure things out so I can start learning how to go about healing…Dad always says “oh well I guess everything is all my fault then ” whenever I mention anything regarding the way I was raised had an obvious impact on who I am now and the things I have to deal with  almost zero self esteem  always blaming myself for small mistakes  poor ability identifying complex emotions  He would always require me to look at him when he was speaking or it was automatically disrespectful   to the point where one time when I was on the computer talking to him with my back to him he stomped over to me and grabbed my shirt with his fist cocked back like he was going to punch me He will constantly talk about how he couldn’t spend more than an hour with my brother and I by himself because “any longer than that and I would go crazy” We have recently moved and all of a sudden my mom in constantly asking how I’m doing  how much they miss us being around  saying “we don’t hear from you after the move so we have a very parental habit of thinking the worst…”My mom texted me the other day after talking with our son and said “Hey kids   thanks for calling   great to see your faces  When we were talking with  son    we asked if “ your dad was home” we were not checking up on you just talking    son  said “ oh yeah   he’s home but we aren’t getting along   he hates me” We could not be more sure that this isn’t true  but thot we should pass on what he said…love you guys ” which just screams of a zero empathy thing to say as a parent who raised kids of her own…If anyone can help give any thoughts or insight I would really appreciate the help  It’s been a long life and I just want to figure out how to get better,2154,412

600,p7gwrs,0,3,Isolated and triggered by those with loving parents Feeling very isolated from people my age who have supportive parents  During the pandemic I watched a lot of people in their ’s  I’m    move back home with their parents  I live alone and have been on my own since I was    I had no option of moving back home  I live out of state to be far away from my family  My parents were both physically abusive and emotionally abusive  My narcissistic mom and I used to talk more up until the pandemic when my resentment for her spiraled out of control  When we would talk before  it was only via text and the conversations were meaningless most of the time  Like she didn’t have a genuine interest in my life  it felt forced and never deep  I’ve recently gone no contact for both of them  And I feel completely alone in the world  Recently had a minor car accident and I had no one to turn to for support  I wish I had parents I could call  I have a loving boyfriend now   months    but I subconsciously push him away out of here of getting too close and getting hurt  He has a close relationship with his mom and she is very supportive and loving  Sometimes it bothers me  I feel lots of envy and I can see in our personalities how our relationship with our parents has shaped us in such different ways  While he’s very compassionate and patient  he simply can’t understand my trust issues  anger  depression  loneliness  How could he  When we visit his moms house there are so many photos of him and his sister all over  So many happy memories in those photos  It makes me feel like shit honestly  My mom would never  In fact  there was an incident once where my little sister found childhood pics of us in the trash  It was when her and my mom were moving to a new apartment and my mom claimed the reason was that she scanned all the pics and therefor didn’t need the physical copies  I visited the new apartment before the pandemic and there were no photos of me or my siblings  No big deal but it does trigger me to see all the love he has  I’m affected by this every day  I’m constantly replaying memories of my parents physically beating me while verbally abusing me  My lip is permanently uneven because of how hard my dad hit me on my mouth one day  You can’t notice it that much but I can  and it haunts me  When I was  they sent me away to another country to live with my dad’s psychotic sister  This was because I was depressed and was cutting myself and running away from home due to the physical abuse  After they sent me away I stayed in that country for  years until I was   I’m  now and don’t live in the same state as them and never see them  Last time I saw my dad was  years ago and he hit me  I saw my mom last year and she made no effort to have any type of meaningful conversation  I feel completely alone  I have no guidance or role models   never have  Feels like I raised myself  People praise me on how strong and independent I am but I don’t want to have to be independent at all times  I’ve been in therapy for almost a year and it’s helping just a little but it’s not enough  What else can I do    I’m considering going to a crisis center for resources  I wish I had friends who have similar situations so that we could be each others support  but honestly they all mostly have great relationships with their parents  My depression about this is affecting my life to the point where I am missing work and experiencing ptsd  Any advice is appreciated,3489,667
601,p7gtzm,0,3,My new therapist made me realize that I do have physical trauma and I dont know how to feel Growing up I never considered myself physically abused and almost never thought to mention it to anybody I was seeing but yesterday I had an initial session with my new therapist and she went through the different traumas to see what I had experienced and when she brought up physical trauma I answered  kinda  and when she asked me to explain I did  When I was younger my nmother would slap me or hit me with objects every once in a while for small things but never on a continuous basis so I didnt consider it physical abuse but my therapist explained that hitting of any kind was abuse and that my obvious visceral reaction  I had started crying  showed that it did affect me  Its now a day after and I still dont know how to feel  I never felt growing up that I was being physically abused and never considered it as something I needed to deal with in therapy but my therapist seems right in that I wouldnt react the way I did unless it really affected me  I dont know how to feel moving forward anymore,1106,209
602,p7gtft,0,5,Older brother reestablished contact with Ndad for money  Im hurt and furious and dont know what else to say to him  One one hand  we are grown adults  Its his choice  But one reason I went NC was because narcs dont get better if theyre enabled by their old family system  I want my dad to go to therapy  Even though I KNOW he probably will never admit he needs it  my brother reestablishing contact will make Ndad think that all of us will come back to him  It makes me feel totally hopeless Ndad is a master at ingratiating himself to people  My brother has had money troubles  new house  newly divorced  lately  and Im pretty sure hes allowing himself contact with my dad because hes offering money  Hes allowing himself to be bought and has no problem with that  its come up before when my dad started leaving me checks after fights  which I rejected  Brother said he wouldve cashed them   That  in turn  is making Ndad feel like this is a normal and acceptable behavior Im worried and hurt about my brother  If I tell my other siblings  theyre likely to cut him out  Brother has already been on the outs with my other siblings  but recently things have been better with him  However  he has displayed many narcissistic qualities and withdrew during our family decision making to cut Ndad out  But he has shown resilience and heart when it mattered When I found out  all I could say to my brother was to please respect our boundaries and not talk about us to NDad  which he agreed to  I asked him to tell the other NC family members to not breach their trust  but he ignored me  My gut is telling me to quietly withdraw from my brother  which I dont want to do because our family has already been fractured enough  Its the easy option  Were all adults with kids and are busy  Should I bother confronting him or just wait it out,1853,334

604,p7g7vr,0,4,Trapped in possible Toxic Household  am I  F  the one who is in the wrong  How do I navigate this situation  Tldr  There is a lack of communication in my home but whenever I bring up how I feel or ask for some respect  Im always met with things such as  I need therapy   Sister and Mother show signs of being unable to take responsibility for their actions while I have to  let go  of things and  try my best   I feel unsatisfied and unhappy at home  Everything feels stagnant First off  thank you for taking the time to read my post  Im going to try and make this as unbiased as possible for everyone involved I  F  have grown up in an abusive and toxic family  My dad    abused my mother    throughout the years and our household was divided  I grew up with two elder sisters and one elder brother  I was bullied by my brother and grew up with a number of mental issues  to say the least  The bullying stopped in high school but there were still a lot of arguments until my mother kicked my father out once we went to university It is safe to say  Mother endured a lot for the sake of allowing us to grow up with a Father until we were at the age we could handle a separation  Time fast forward  and things have settled a lot in our house  No arguments etc We have all started our own healing journeys  apart from my brother and one sister I think   Sister       well call her S  reads a lot of books as for my Mother who reads a lot of self improvement and spirituality books  This is for the same as me I recently started taking my healing journey seriously and began shadow work that explored my past trauma  I began to realize a lot of ways I lacked boundaries and I also explored a lot of ways this led to me being mistreated growing up e g bullying  attracting those who disregarded my  non existant  boundaries But I always felt resistance around returning home from university  I feel as if I was scapegoated in my family  I told my mother this I dont think she considered my perspective too much  Even reading a lot  I realized I was still being disrespected by my elders in the house An example of this is one time I asked my S and S to clean the bathroom  They ignored me over text at first but when I chased them up S went into a speech about how I did not need to be a hero all the time and if I left it then it would be done   except I had left it for a week and a half and it wasnt being done  I felt like shit and I told Mother but I believe she only told me to ignore her Id like to say S  who I live with mainly  works a lot  She puts in a lot of hours and I can appreciate she feels exhausted a lot  I  myself  do not work  but I try to ensure I put in a lot of housework as possible Fast forward to March when I returned home from university  One sign of trouble came from when I tried making jokes with Mother  She would often give me a dead  straight face and I eventually gave up trying to make jokes with her  however  she would come to me later and say she thinks I lost my sense of humour  I believe this came from her trying to make jokes with me but I would not be receptive due to our earlier instances In the meantime  S has her things in my room in a wardrobe she paid for  It is a better wardrobe than what I had for before and I am truly grateful for it but I do not have enough space for my things  The first time I asked S to move out she tried to joke it was her wardrobe but I did not laugh as I was serious  I told her I felt disrespected but she told me to be positive which I told her was toxic  She then went on a long speech telling me to basically accept her being in my room and I had nothing to say So I continued my shadow work and due to a lot of trauma coming to the surface  I began feeling down which was noticeable  Mother would ask me what was wrong but I would brush her off until one day I came to her and told her how I felt about growing up in the house  She told me to let it go and that growing up wasnt that bad  I personally feel like she dismissed my feelings I also told her about times I felt disrespected and gave her examples    For instance  at times she was sarcastic to me for no reason and she told me I need to accept the way people are  I told her about Ss things in my room and she told me S came to her  I asked her what she cried about and Mother said some people have a lot going on  I told Mother this was emotional manipulation and Mother made everything about me Despite being unhappy in the house  I was told I should consider therapy and that I should try and do better  Mother also told me about her she had to endure a lot of abuse in those past years and went on a long speech about Lord knows what Fast forward to today  I have been unhappy for a  hours  staying in my room and just being by myself because nothing I bring up gets resolved  Mother came to my room and said  cant you wash up when were not here   BARING IN MIND  I always wash up when I see dishes in the sink  Last year  it was me that was washing up most days  S sits at a table and does work  I always feel like the dishes get left to me to do Ive been doing so for the past months  I have been feeling depressed and unhappy but I feel like Mother came to me  judging me for not washing up  I told her I was busy so I could not talk in that moment but she left on a final note of judging me I exploded  I went downstairs and ranted about how I feel like I am not considered  I called out their hypocrisy and told S and Mother everything is about my issues and how I need therapy and how they can not take responsibility for their actions  I also told MOther she had a victmin mentality and mocked her for her abuse  bad I know and I am not proud of it S told my mother I called her mentally abusive when I asked her to move out of my room  I told her Mother told me how she cried to her and they both denied it  S accused me of being aggressive the first time I asked her to move out of my room  the second  Mother was present  I snapped at them and said I would happily move out and not speak to them  Honestly  if I was able to leave  I would happily do so  I told them both they had victim mentalities and they told me they are worried about my mental health and denied everything I brought up What do you guys think about this situation  I will clarify further if needs be  What do I do  Communication is lacking in my house but I feel like what I bring up will always be my fault Thank you for reading  I am sorry for the length of my post,6576,1299

607,p7g3ma,0,3,Need advice on how to improve further after i NC’d mom I NC’d her couple weeks ago  She made me view myself like I belonged to her collection of animals  I wasn’t allowed to keep secrets from her  could never play with my friends without my mom first ‘getting to know them’ or ‘showing interest’ Up until   years old my friends liked that  I had lots of friends  But around that age they started calling me mommas boy  I slowly lost everyone  I asked my best friend for advice  he told me keep secrets from her  become independent  I immediately did that  my mom went crazy immediately  I wasn’t allowed to go to bed  Because my dad would ‘teach me a lesson’  I said ‘no he won’t’  I fell asleep on the couch that night only to awaken in the middle of the night to hear them screaming  She managed to get my dad to beat me up  while he was crying  telling me to not keep secrets from mom  I told him I’m loosing everyone  he said  daddy knows  just don’t keep secrets from mom Ever since that day I focused on the farm we had  on the animals  Because that were the only living things that appreciated me  Only my mom was there to continuesly tell me I didn’t put in effort  She started medicating me at age  with antipsychotics  For some reason I kept taking those pills till a couple months ago  including with a lot of other chemicals you wouldn’t want to give to a horse  I quit everything a couple months ago and I’m just shocked by how I function  I can’t even eat with knife and fork  because mom never thought me  she just gave me a spoon  She can’t use the knife and fork herself and makes a mess out of it every time  But according to her  it’s all my own fault Now I’m sober  I realise I don’t even have developed an identity  So I started with throwing all her shit and that of her crazy imbecile sister out of my home  So nothing reminds me of her in my home  Got a haircut done  Which she always used to do for me  because otherwise I wouldn’t want that huge crest on my head  which I didn’t like  According to her my head looks dirty and fatty when I have a short hairstyle  So I went for short with a lot of wax  just because I can I went to my GP  Who said he’d help me get my life going  but I’m not sure he understands  Also did an entry exam to get into university  which I passed  I never graduated highschool because mom send me to a special needs school  One where all the kids did the haldol shuffle I do my best taking care of myself  cooking good food  etc  But I’m just not sure how to deal with other people  I don’t know what I can tell them  how much I should tell them  I only lived for all those animals we had for so long  they used to be my whole world  Giving me what my mom never could  showing gratitude for the effort I put in  I’m talking to my GP next week to get some advice on how to behave while starting university next month Because I was never allowed to keep secrets from mom  I told her so much crap  she would stop bothering me  Made constant jokes out of myself so she wouldn’t hurt me further  I find myself behaving that way with other people and I don’t want that I want to be able to keep secrets and not feel the need to say rediculous things to make people question what’s true  Just be able to have normal conversations  a skill I’ve never learned  It’s been my defence mechanism against that bitch for so long  I don’t know how to change it overnight  Somewhere I feel the need to go tell her the truth  But I know  she would love that  she’d make a circus out of it  make me feel guilty and make me reinstate contact and figure out all my secrets  She leaves me alone for the time being  so let’s keep it that way  She already stole my childhood Im also planning on not having contact with the rest of her family  Because they tell her everything When I NC’d her  she asked so I won’t see you ever again  That wasn’t even something I told her  I just told her I needed space  start functioning independent  I think that says enough about her conscience,4034,770

611,p7f66o,0,32,its so hard growing up when your parents are not grown ups  my dad acts like a  year old and my mom acts like shes   everyone has always been like  you are so grown up and mature for your age   well  its because these two act like children with all their stupid drama and attention seeking  I am not seen as someone of myself or as myself  Any time my mom gets me something  its just something she wanted for herself and uses me as the excuse to be selfless  All i asked for was a slice of dang chocolate cake for my birthday  thats all i wanted  And she gets all these clothes and shoes  and when i say I DIDNT WANT THIS  I DIDNT WANT THIS  I AM MOVING TO A WHOLE NEW PLACE ACROSS THE PACIFIC  she just could not understand  I told her i just got rid of a bunch of shit to move and she could just not understand  I am became the ungratful bitch because i didnt want the clothes i told her not to buy cause i am moving  man  so much for a supportive family  gosh  this whole family is just a chaos of energy and it just makes me not want to be with anyone but myself  because i know myself and understand what i like and dont like  heck it makes me not want to be with or around people ever again  i am better alone  then they try to infantilize you to make them FEEL like their good parents  but sometimes i think thats just all that they know  they dont know how to really be supportive or to aplogize when they do something wrong  cause they see nothing they do as wrong   they dont know how to take the fact that you have a different opinion from them into consideration  its just like you are this extention of themselves even when you dont want to be  you want to be yourself  you want to be F R E E  you want to be understood instead of trying to always understand them  i think its just better to maybe love these people at a distance  they dont notice the difference weather you are close or far away cause in the end they dont see you  you just become a reflection of themselves   amp  xB gosh  all of it just makes me feel so broken at times  like completely incomplete  they will never see what they do as wrong or you as an individual   but how do you fix it  and maybe its ok to be broken  you know  people tell me the world is not broken  but when you feel broken and you dont understand it how do you see it as anything else  how do you wade through it  how do you find the right way to deal with it,2431,483

615,p7epbd,0,113,What goes through narcissistic parents minds before they die  Last night  I found out from a sibling that my nmom is scared of dying and is having counselling for that  To start I was weirded out that a narcissist in their eighties nineties hasn’t reconciled to death already  But today I am thinking that for a narcissist whats truly terrible about dying is the realisation that they won’t be able to aggressively control people anymore  Am interested in other peoples’ thoughts on this,488,82

618,p7e96o,0,2,Just remembered something  My parents both used to play World of Warcraft before i did   Dont question it  its weird  When they divorced  especially my mom kept playing extreme amounts  but that stopped when she met her new boyfriend  now my stepfather   When she stopped  she gave her account to me  but at the same time always kept asking if her old characters still existed and how i ruined them  even tho i didnt even touch them  But she kept being adamant about this  This may seem small  but it has lead to me discovering that she did use this sort of behaviour all the time against me  even in much more extreme circumstances  I now suffer from avoidant personality disorder and depression,702,123
619,p7e4g5,0,2,Looking for Insight I am new to this sub so sorry in advance if my story isnt formatted well or whatever  My  M  parents and I had a difficult relationship growing up  but things were going pretty well with them up until last June when my Dad passed away suddenly  I had mixed feelings about his death as  while I loved him  he was an alcoholic and that affected his ability to be a good parent  My mom is an emotionally abusive narcissist who knows how to push everyones buttons in order to get what she wants out of people  When my Dad died  he left my NMom behind and she went into a tailspin  The past year has been full of guilt trips  manipulation  and emotional abuse  I will only share one example in order to keep this short    after I had moved in with her for approx   months following my Dads death  I was preparing to leave for a series of road trips in September  at the end of which I was going to propose to my now fiancee  I was going to be gone for like  weeks and was very visibly excited about the upcoming engagement  On my way out the door my Mom sat me down out of the blue and gave me on of the worst guilt trips of my life  including insinuating that I cant leave for my trip and do my proposal because  I need you to be here with me as my companion   It really messed with me and put a damper on the whole thing  I eventually reconnected with my therapist in order to start working on anger issues  We determined that my anger issues stem from a childhood of abuse  as anger is a defense mechanism to help prevent abuse  My therapist has been helping me understand why healthy boundaries are necessary  Setting boundaries has been complicated as my mom still needs to sell her house and we  my twin sister and I  have been doing a LOT of work on it  for example  we did    in drywall repairs after it was discovered that one of the piles of hoarded shit in the basement had covered the walls in black mold   My sister and I both just want to get this house sold so we can move on with our lives but my mom kept adding more and more stuff to the  list  while delaying listing it on the market  My sister  our fiancees  and I got together recently and decided enough is enough  that we would insist that she either put the house on the market or pay for someone else to continue to improve the house  Essenrially  enough with the free work  we have our own lives  On the  year anniversary of my Dads death  my fiancee and I went over to her house for dinner  It was the typical stuff  she wasnt going to eat because she is too sad  etc    The conversation turned to the house and I asserted that she should sell it ASAP  She countered with  there is so much that still needs to be done   I said  you need to pay someone to do that stuff  because I cant do all of it   Her response was  why would I do that when I have children who are supposed to help me   She then laid into me with a shocking and nasty amount of emotional abuse  like  you are a bad son    I am disappointed in you   and  I thought you were here to support me but I guess youre just here to abandon me in my time of need   I stuck to my guns and didnt lose my temper    just stayed stoic and assertive about the whole thing  thanks therapy   until she kicked us out of the house  Since then Ive decided to go Low Contact  It was very revealing to hear the abuse coming out of her that heavily    its almost like that abusive intent has been the whole time but shes been more tactful about it in the past  Ive talked to her just a few times  She sent a text saying she doesnt know why our relationship is strained  I explicitly told her that I am setting boundaries as a part of my trauma work in therapy due to the abuse I suffered as a child at home  school  and church  she is heavily religious and is a director of religious education for the Catholic Church   She said she would do  whatever it takes  to repair our relationship  We had my sisters wedding last month and my fiancee suggested that I ask her to dance for a slow song  During our dance she started saying things like  Im sorry for whatever I did  and  Can we please just go to the pool together    This rubbed me the wrong way because its not a matter of  whatever you did   You told me I was a bad son like a month ago after I fixed your house up for a year  Im seriously not mad about it  but like  do you not understand why that was a problem  Do I want this person to continue to be a presence in my life  Also  is she still just trying to get something out of me  Yesterday  I called my sister with some exciting news about grad school and at the end of the conversation she said  you should call mom and tell her  she has been asking about you and wondering how you are   I was going to call my mom    until I thought  why   I dont want to open myself up to her misery and emotional abuse today  Later on  I got a text from my mom saying that she misses me  Can anyone else share some insight on if when they felt comfortable lessening their Low Contact policy with with Nparent  and why  I have been enjoying my  freedom  from the abuse recently and am in no rush    however I DO want to attempt to improve our relationship at some point,5255,1012
620,p7dy58,0,31,I actually hate my Nmum  She lied to me and then embarrassed me at the dentist I go to  And I also think she may be a Karen idk  Basically last week she spoke to the dentist and all week she had me believe that I was finally getting braces put in today even thoe deep down I knew I wasnt actually getting braces today at all because I think I had a gut Instinct When we arrived at the dentist since its covid we werent allowed to go in and had to speak to the receptionist from the front window to confirm our booking and then they told my Nmum that I was only allowed in and that she had to wait outside until I finished my appointment due to covid restrictions and such and its not like the staff meant any hatred or Ill will for my Nmum they were litterly just following the law And then this was when all hell broke loose and my mum started litterly arguing with the reception staff to let her in so she could be with me just incase I cried once I got my braces on and they told her she was not allowed in and even if she was she is not allowed to go into the operation room with me she due to covid so she would have to wait in the reception In the end they finally told her she could come in after her arguing with the staff for a while and they told her she had to wear a mask before she was allowed in thoe and since my non vaccinated  and non mask wearin Nmum didnt have one on they tried to give her one to wear and my Nmum had the audacity to litterly refuse to wear the mask and be like  its ok I will just put up my shirt and use that as a mask   said in a Karen tone  and then the receptionist again said politely   plz put on the mask otherwise your not allowed to come in  and after much argument and rebuttal from my Nmums and she finally agreed to wear the mask and came inside and sat down on a chair  meters away from me and she was still kinda complaining but in our language this time instead of English And then the receptionist informed my mum that she wasnt allowed to come into the actual operation dentist room with me and that she would have to wait in the reception waiting area and my mum argued back again like this was getting to my nerves at this point and I litterly wanted to shout and tell my mum to shut the hell up but sadly I missed that opportunity And then the orthodontist came and called me to my appointment operation room and then as I was getting up to leave I told my Nmum in my language to just sit there and not say anything and she said ok And then in the room the orthodontist bascially told me what I had already thought and said this was my first appointment to towards getting my braces and that I wasnt actually gonna get braces today And they told me to go to the reception and book a checkup appointment to get my teeth checked and then when I went there as I went up the receptionist my mum got up and was asking me questions about what they said and stuff like that and I didnt want to deal with her so I didnt answer back and then whilst I was booking my appointment for my checkup the receptionist said since I was already there they had a free orthodontist doctor available and said I would have to wait upstairs for  minutes and at this point they told my mum she would have to wait outside agian and again the child like tantrum on why she cant wait outside  started and I was just over my Nmumd attitude so I just went upstairs completely ignoring her whole she argued with the receptionist on why she should be allowed to sit with me and then finally I heard her say  im going  I am going  very loudly from upstairs and I just felt hella embarrassed about the whole situation Anyway I had my checkup and when I was heading downstairs to leave I wanted to apologise to the reception staff for my Nmums behaviour but I was too embarrassed Anway I went outside and as too nobodys surprise my mum was still mad about the whole situation and she basically decided she wanted to let the whole world know how mad she was as she continued to complain in our language very loudly on our way to the bus stop saying things like this is why I hate  Christians or non muslims  because my mother is a muslim and hates anyone from any religion other than her own and I told her to quite down but she wouldnt listen And then when we went onto the bus my Nmum who I was clearly mad at couldnt tell I was mad at her so she reportedly asked me the same question of  what did the orthodontist say about your braces and teeth  and I kept replying by saying  pls stop talking  which sounds way better and nicer than it does in English and plus there were people on the bus and my Nmum had no respect for them and was like  are we not allowed to talk  I mean we could but Im mad at you and your talking very loudly and thats fucking rude to the other passengers  And after a while of me responding with the same line she got the memo and said  fine I will stop talking  And then when we got of the bus and was walking home she kept saying how she would write a formal complaint about the reception staff and how she would get them all fired  And I was fast walking and after a while o stopped to get the house keys from her and continued to fast walk home and she said  why are you walking so fast   why are you mad at me I did nothing wrong  I didnt respond quickly entered the house took my shoes off and went to my room not before telling my two siblings what our mum did and both of them agreed that  that was embarrassing And then my sister went downstairs and my mum told her a complete different and false story than the real one that happened and my Nmum had the audacity to tell me not speak to her and act like victim when she was the embarrassing one,5751,1121

623,p7d91t,0,14,After reflecting on my abusive upbringing  I think that I was very close to being a conspiracy theorist or a terrorist or a narcissist who hates the world and I think that this is why I do not like to label conspiracy theories or similar groups as  idiotic  and can empathise more  I hope that I am not being too far fetched here or posting something that is not appropriate I have been doing a lot of self reflection  which is something that I do often especially with the help of my therapist and the mindfulness that I do   I have been reflecting on my past self and I realised that over the years  I have been doing with large amounts of anger and fury  sometimes in explosive ways and especially towards anything and anyone  including me   I still struggle with anger but I noticed that I sometimes manage to suppress it or process it but knowing that I still struggle with this type of anger that is often directed with the attitude of unfairness or cynicism or victimisation  that really caught my attention I must admit   as much as I really hate it and it annoys me  victimisation feels addicting and it is almost empowering for the most pity and sympathy you will get  There are moments I want to victimise myself without realising it and  find an excuse  for this victimization by saying that I was treated unfairly  I do understand that many people are oppressed and will end up feeling angry for such injustices but over time  I later learned that I have to be responsible for my own actions and process these thoughts accordingly And I noticed that while I still struggle with some form of anger or I have this occasional dose of paranoia and cynicism that makes me think that I am about to become a conspiracy theorist  I realise that before  I used to actually think like this at a much greater level And to some extent  I do believe that those who actively behave in ways are akin to conspiracy theorists  or terrorists or just being plain arrogant  I think I can understand where this stems from   a lot of unprocessed emotions and insecurities that are projected to someone else  possibly as a side effect of some troubled upbringing or trauma  amp  xB A part of me says that this cynicism is sound  If my life mostly involved being warped and twisted in ways that make me so hateful and angry towards the world and think that it is about to get me  it is no wonder I have this survival instinct to think of the worst and think of anything that can happen even if it may not be real because the mind is a very cunning thing if you are not careful Truth to be told  there is some logic to this as well because if you dig deeper into this  you will realise that injustices did and still exist in some shape or form  There are ones that are even on a governmental level or a nation wide level and ones that were either done in secret or ones that people know to exist but some people got away with it for whatever reason   whether it was power  money  influence and so on So obviously  when combined with this warped idea that the world is a cold and cruel place  especially knowing that I was raised in that type of environment that eventually shaped this kind of reality in me  this eventually leads to some very unhealthy thinking and ones that will be very difficult to tackle because they go keep into your core and affect your primal instincts and how you feel about yourself and the universe  amp  xB I am not saying that people who are terrorists or conspiracy theorists or whatever are excused  If people break the law or harm others or try to spread information that is not real or twisted or want to manipulate or influence people to push a certain agenda that is based on a very passionate and possibly immoral attitude  then of course  this will lead to its own consequences We have many arguments in philosophy  psychology  political theory and even history that delve into this and they tell us how this type of thinking will have its own repercussions But I will not lie     whenever I see these people or hear their claims  I am more inclined to ask why they think like this or understand where these ideas are stemming from instead of neglecting them entirely and calling them  fools,4252,757

625,p7co3b,0,6,Realized my twin was my narcissist not my neglectful mom Sure my mom is a narcissist  just not to me  Im  now and it really hurts that the deep connection Ive always dreamed having with her was all a lie   I found out a couple weeks ago shes been cheating on her husband   they met  years ago in high school  the entire time with at least  different men  She decided to leave him  because he doesnt impress her work friends     And get a divorce because hes boring and doesnt help around the house  which were lies   Not two days after she coerced him into getting a vasectomy so she would have sex with him again  because she already ruined her body popping out  kids  she hooked up with some guy on a work trip  Shes never been truthful with me  all the lies started becoming apparent because if this  but I suspected she was cheating so I just happened to ask after she decided to move out  She was bragging about this guy and claiming shes so excited for me to meet him  Ive had a pretty deep platonic connection with her husband since they met  but she was feeding both of us lies about how shitty the other was which kept us from pursuing our friendship all these years  she though I was a slut and would fuck him      We recently reconnected as hes been pursuing his spirituality manhood through yoga and meditation  I encouraged him and even read a few books to discuss with him  This infuriated her  She would be cold when I came over and even bitched at us for talking during a shitty kids TV show we had put on for our kids   husband later explained  she likes to check out mentally at night and we disturbed that   like wtf    The real kicker for me is when I told her about a house my husband and I just bought in January that wasnt going to be ready until end of this month   yay just  more weeks   She literally had no reaction  Totally flat and avoidant  I learned later that she blew up on her ex demanding they renovate their house   a s model in the best neighborhood in our city  saying they never gave anything nice and shes sick of living in this shitty house  The icing on the cake is that I realize she had wanted to leave him the last few years but now she kicked it into high gear trying to find a man to monkey branch to  After announcing she was divorcing a few weeks ago she couldnt kick her husband out so she immediately got a new luxury br  apartment and moved out   conveniently before my house was ready      She rented a truck and completely trashed the house   taking all her shit  shed basically hoarded a hobby lobby at this point shutting the family out  without any regard to what her kids thought was theirs   She plans on having half custody of her  kids   girls  boy age    in that  extra bedroom   Relax  Im happy now so theyll be fine    Her psychopathy baffles me  It broke my heart hearing my nieces say  mommy took all my makeup and paints    I started hearing about the abusive episodes right before they split up  she proudly admitted them herself   I locked my daughter in a dog cage I the basement for two hours because she kept waking me up at night saying shes scared  Thank God she doesnt complain anymore   She spent her sons kid birthday party getting smashed and complaining how dense husband was  She didnt even acknowledge him and even dumped her kids off on me and disappeared  When her son and husband wanted to stay longer she went home and locked the bedroom door forcing husband to sleep in the basement  Even though she portrays herself as an awesome laid back mom  they raise themselves right     Shes literally never had the kids by herself for more than a day and husband actually did a majority of the childcare behind closed doors    he never helps around the house all he does is play with kids    He wanted her to do one week by herself before she took custody and she flat out refused  Even though she has supposed half custody the kids basically have just done weekends with her  Im disgusted and shocked by all this as she brushes it off as being the best time in her life  shes finally free     I also realized shes been trying to convince me my husbands a lazy controlling worthless piece of shit  which hes not  for the whole  years of our relationship  I almost did leave  but thank God u have enough humility to apologize for my shitty behavior  Ive always tied my identity with her  cuz you know twins  but Its cathartic to finally be okay with myself and realize Im not a narc just because I come from a family of them  Thanks for listening to my long rant,4593,854

627,p7cgkn,0,12,Its as if nParents have a select few  parenting values  that never change  never have exceptions  and are life or death  Like my parents flipped when the cabin light gets turned on in the car at night and this is a prime albeit benign example  Im highlighting this topic because I think it has a lot to do with the abusive tendencies they have  as if theyre brains are frozen in a childlike state of obedience TO the rules they learned  and now being in a position of power over a child obviously cant have them doing things they didnt get to do Im sure you can think of examples because what I mean extends beyond the definition of  rules  exactly and I know I went on a tangent a bit but ya what do you think,720,136
628,p7c5ta,0,6,My dad put me in the education program of his company  and Im thinking of moving out I know a lot of people would say youre lucky to have that kind of opportunity  even hate me for it  but this is nothing I asked for  The only reason I agreed to all this is because my dad would endlessly harass me for it if I didnt agree to it Im doing programming atm  and I just graduated uni  My goal was to be a game dev  but he saw a programming education course in his company and put me in there right away because hes a control freak  The day I went there I figured out I was the only person thats not experienced  and all of the others have    years of experiences in other companies  He asked me how it was  and I said I dont think this is sth for me  and then he went on a rant that Im just not trying hard enough  and with a door between us I just lost it and yelled at him to do it himself if he loves it so much  The courses just go on with the assumption that everyone knows enough  but I dont Its not entertaining in any way  Im legit dying inside  Id like to quit next week  and find a new house that I can move in to  If I quit within a week  they said they wont charge me for the education fees  My mom doesnt do anything for me either other than saying just cope  Im sick and tired of them  giving sth that I dont want then if I dont fulfill it they make me feel like I dont have enough willpower or something Luckily I found a house thats fit for me to rent  I just need a part time job now  Im still questioning myself if I have enough guts to move out,1594,321
629,p7c46j,0,4,I’m so tired of being poor after escaping N parents… My N parents has always given me money growing up all until the end of college university  They never taught me financial literacy and I had to learn myself from the age of    years ago   and didn’t really go far  I’m the only child so it was a given that all their assets would be passed down to me  and I lived with that safety net for most my life until recently  About a year ago  all their emotional and verbal abuse came to light and I realised that I was abused throughout my childhood growing up  I decided to not kiss their ass anymore and became LC  Subsequently  it is likely that I won’t be receiving the inheritance  and it’s been difficult for me to come to terms with that as I had thought I’d be financially well all my life  That’s not to say that I didn’t work hard  but when N parents used money as a means of control  you end up relying on them  and being more careless about money saving less choosing less money driven careers  If I knew I was gonna be cut off  I would have chosen a more lucrative career and started younger  Now I’m in lockdown and living in a two bedroom house with my partner and in laws  The house is small and moldy and I just feel so sad and poor  And confined in such a small space  All our stuff is in one bedroom and there is hardly any storage  We can’t move due to lockdown and it won’t be classed as an emergency move  Not to mention it’ll cost x more than the amount that we are paying now for board which is   week  The in laws are lovely but we’ve been here for  months still waiting for our new  small  house to be built  It’s been delayed by about  months and likely another   months due to lockdown  Does anyone have any tips on how to cope with these feelings  I wasn’t sure which subreddit to post in…Thanks so much in advance,1866,355
630,p7bycu,0,31,Is anyone else close with their Nparent and love them  but also they can be so awful and toxic and hurt you so much  Title might be confusing  For context  I don’t know if my mother is a narcissist  but she has so many narcissistic traits  We look exactly alike  our personalities are basically the same and I do love my mum very much  There are times when she is so good to me  can help me in a situation mostly and be kind  But there are other times  throughout my whole life where she is just awful  She’s a recovered alcoholic  and when she was drinking it was much worse  But we argue sometimes and she says the most evil things  even if we make up  we could be having a nice conversation and some narc type thing is slipped in and it makes my heart ache so much  How can she be so loving and nice but also have such shitty opinions and words sometimes I probably haven’t explained this very well but I’m wondering if anyone is in the same situation  She hurts me so much and I think why it hurts more is because she can be so loving at times TL DR   does anyone anyone else have an Nparent who isn’t always awful  but their narc traits are just so so hurtful,1170,226
631,p7brh6,0,3,does this seems like abuse  what can i do about it as a minor  hi  uh so i’m writing this because i don’t know what else to do and i thought it might be a good idea to ask in this sub  the thing is i can’t stand my mom anymore and i want to depend on her as little as possible but i don’t know how  so if anyone has any idea how i can be a little more independent  financially or otherwise  please let me know  to put it more in context  my mother has extremely narcissistic behaviors  she has never been emotionally present or has even tried to be  whenever i have tried to open up to her it has ended badly  very badly  basically any problem of mine  it has to be about her  last year i struggled a lot with anxiety but the only thing that she managed to do was to yell at me and threaten me to put me in a mental hospital  i also used to have panic attacks very frequently until one day she exploded and started throwing things at me screaming about how much of a disappointment i was to her and that i basically ruined her vacations  not to mention the other day she did the same thing because i almost fainted at school and made her wait a little too long in the parking lot  my mom tends to have many of these violent outbursts  in which she threatens to kill herself  among other things and honestly i really want to go live with my dad but i’m afraid that she’ll actually kill herself if i do so  she has already tried in the past  she also tends to be very bipolar when it comes to giving love  in that sense  i always felt that i should beg for it  do things to deserve it and until now i realize that this isn’t normal  at least in a parent  how do you even deal with a mother like this   btw i’m so sorry if this is painful to read  english is not my first language but i’m trying my best,1805,362

633,p7blvm,0,2,Im afraid that the path Im headed down is going to kill me  I need someone to talk to   TW  To preface  I know this may not be the most appropriate place for this  I do have NParents  but this is more of a support seeking post for all of my issues and not just that one  since I dont think I could separate them even if I tried  Im a little bit desperate to be heard and to find someone to talk to so I hope its okay this once I feel so completely broken that Im not sure where to begin in asking for help  I have been through things that I would never wish on anyone and Im running out of ways to cope that wont put me in the ground  When talking to a friend stopped working years ago  I turned to self injury  That stopped working  so I turned to flat out denial  From there  it became promiscuity  And then drugs  and then alcohol  and then more severe self injury and now harder drugs  Im realizing that Im going to die if I dont help myself  and despite many years of suicidal impulses and fantasies  the thought of dying on any terms other than my own is terrifying Ive been through many professionals  I have a loving boyfriend and one or two patient friends  No family  though  And I think the two things that I desperately need  which have been missing from everything Ive tried and failed to find comfort in in the past  are  a  a person who understands on a personal level because theyve been there  and  b  a person who has that whole maternal  protective thing that Ive never gotten to experience  I cant recall a time in my entire life that Ive felt protected  even as a young child  and I think it may help me give a shit about saving my own life to believe that Im valuable enough to someone to be worth protecting If anyone at all feels like talking  I would be very grateful  I just ask that you be woman identified  non religious  and non judgmental of the things Ive had to do in order to survive  Ill also leave a heavy trigger warning here for severe child abuse  of all types   rape  self injury  suicide  and substance abuse,2075,382
634,p7bjjt,0,11,I had to restrain my mother from attacking my sibling today  I woke at  in the morning to screams and slapping noises  My abusive parent was beating my  year old sibling for playing games overnight  and talking with her friends  Found pitiful reasons like  you are burning our electricity bills   to add to the story  while I was catching her hands in the air  or how  disrespectful  my sisters replies were  An abrupt awakening for sure  My heart was basically shaking in my chest  as I tried to calm the spirits down and find some words to take my moms head off the matter  She wasnt letting up   In fact  she got so aggressive again  that for the first time  I had to repeatedly push and restrain her out of a room  I locked the door behind me to be sure  She then went to insult me  tell me how shes going to get a lawyer to get me kicked out of the house   year old undergrad in my final year   and she proceeded to hit me on the chest a couple of times  Then  crying  she let up  and walked to her room while sobbing how our presence is destroying her life  how we made her our slave etc    Ive never seen her like this  Yes  our fights can get really bad  but this time  she behaved like a clinical patient  Like an animal that just wanted to get inside a cage to jump on her prey   She really likes making my sister the center of her problems  and lets out all her rage on my sibling   And the more she does it  the bigger the rebellious spirit of my sister grows  Right now  for the Nth time  shes threatening to oust us from the house    I dared her to take every means available to her to do so  and called my entire family to update them on the situation  I consider it somewhat scummy to try and  recruit  people to my side  but I honestly do not feel safe with this woman anymore  I want to have some net of safety and backing from people I trust  These people have cut their connections with this woman long ago  for good reason  But we are mainly counting on our divorced dad  should things go from bad to worse  And I do not wish to burden him further,2085,408
635,p7bhxd,0,7,Self doubt and my mother Hey  first post here  I am in a tough spiral of self doubt right now  and think i might need some advice  So  here is some context  my mother  who has strong narcissistic  and BPD traits  but has never been formally diagnosed  kicked me  M  out  We have been in a cycle for  years where she would threaten me every few months that i will have to move out  This always happened spontaneously  and she was very unplanned in that regard  More so get out  i cant take it anymore  Now the thing is  im definitely guilty of a lot of things  For instance  even though never teaching me how to do it  she wanted me to do things around the house  and there were a lot of cases were i didnt do that  sometimes out of spite  often out of laziness  She also wanted me to get a proper job  which i also didnt  This had more to do with being lazy and also depressed most of the time  Now the thing is  she says her reason for kicking me out was that i didnt do better  even though promising i would  This makes me unsure if she really abused me  or if she was reacting to my obnoxiousness  It would give me some peace to know that i didnt deserve what happened and that i wasnt the villain  I know that this isnt possible to assess on reddit  but advice is still very much appreciated,1308,253
636,p7bd4h,0,3,just a short rant to start this off  im from a rather conservative family where you’re always told to respect your elders  but its so mind blowing how they expect us to respect them yet they dont even treat us with the same respect  and whenever i do something that’s even the slightest of disrespectful in their standards  they always pull out the “im your mother father and not your friend” card  i cant even count the times when i actually tried to have a normal conversation with my mom but she always cuts me off by screaming aggressively at me  or just changing the subject entirely  its like she isn’t even listening to me  yet my dad  who’s a real enabler as much as i love him  keeps telling me to keep my composure and its just so hard when all she does is do the opposite  she always gets to treat me like shit and noone says anything to that  but the moment i say literally just ANYTHING or step in to defend my sister  we both get the same treatment  my other family members get so defensive and keep telling me to just shut up and suck it up  its so unfair  like i dont understand why they get so offended whenever i just want to tell them how that makes me feel  is something wrong with me for not respecting her like they keep telling me  just wanted to let this out since we had an argument just now again,1323,253

649,p78sqg,0,14,Nmom put a  visitation journal  from my childhood in a box marked for me  I read it because I make bad decisions  Context  Vulnerable Nmom  alcoholic dad who could be cold angry  possible N himself  they divorced when I was young  about five Its essentially a journal documenting mostly kid exchanges from an early year in their divorce  taking me through kindergarten to first grade  It may have been the first real year in which my dad started having visitations longer than an afternoon  Im not sure if  visitation journals  are court ordered or if my mom thought she was being legally savvy or what  The super weird part is that the journaling starts about halfway through  with a bunch of blank pages beforeit Basically  the entire year its just talking about how my sibling and I would get sick after we visited my dad and then my mom would blame it on his negligence  Or shed say we were sick when we went to his house and he didnt take care of us properly   this isnt always untrue  he once tried to force me on a two day roadtrip when I was projectile vomiting from stomach flu  and he left my sibling and me at home for a church meeting while I was sick and we were too young to be alone    Occasional cringe  she said she passed by my dads house on the way home from work   his house was  not  on her way home from work   and saw us unaccompanied on the sidewalk  Once she said she left a note on his car   I dont know if such things were more normal in the time before e mail and texting  but her boundaries seemed off to me There were a few times when things she said rang true  In one  my mom was frustrated my dad wasnt offering his two cents on how to approach an illness we had and he said   You were the one who decided to get the divorce  you get to figure all these things out yourself   He made lots of cold flippant remarks like that growing up  There was another statement about a school play and how my dad attended and I waved  but he never came up to say hello  Presumably  he was avoiding my mom  She also remarked he didnt come to school to see me off on the first day of first grade and that I  never  asked where he was  Did I expect him to see me off  We werent a family anymore  Why would both be there Im not sure how much these illnesses were normal kids at germy school illnesses  how much was a hovering Nmom exaggerating to make my dad look bad  and how much was the trauma of two kids being tossed around between warring parents and not having support for emotional pain so it manifests as feeling ill instead But like    and forgive my language    why  the fuck  was this in the box my mom had set aside for me Is it wrong for me to be upset that shed put something so steeped in so much childhood trauma in a box meant for me  Like what purpose would this serve other than to manipulate me into feeling sorry for her or hating my dad If anything I just feel more resentful than ever of my parents for not worrying how these antics would damage my sibling and me  They have  deeply  My sibling and I both struggle with mental health and its really made our lives isolated and challenging  Ugh  I dont even know how to treat my mom the next time I see her since she doesnt know I read this but also clearly wanted me to at some point,3304,611

664,p76h1t,0,16,I wrote a letter to my parents explaining that Im going NC two years ago and they never responded  Has this happened to anyone else  Dont get me wrong  Im happy on one hand that my parents  for the first time in my life  respected the boundaries Ive put in place But on the other hand its so beyond hurtful that they have nothing to say  My therapist is still floored by their silence and says shes never seen this happen to her clients who have gone no contact  Im glad theyre not in my life  but some days it really hurts knowing that they never really cared about me,580,109
665,p76c8q,0,13,I need a comeback  short or long  when someone says  I did it out of love  I often hear this when I try to point out how damaging someones actions were to me or other people  And its usually from Christians  I said I hated my father and he retorted saying everything he did was out of love  I have documented many instances of emotional and physical abuse from him  but that would require its own post Eg     Caning   Actions that hurt ones self esteem   How Christians handle lgbt issues   The way a lot of people handle other people who are depressed  seriously I am so sick of people telling others to just  do it  and pull yourself by your bootstraps Some I have thought of have been  How did that action show love  but I think it isnt too effectiveThis is the best one I can come up with  which comes from the bible itself  Love is patient  love is kind  It does not envy  it does not boast  it  is not proud  It does not dishonor others  it is not self seeking  it  is not easily angered  it keeps no record of wrongs  Love does not  delight in evil but rejoices with the truth    The problem comes with that last line as many will say that being lgbt is evil,1187,223
666,p7692z,0,3,My Grandmother is a Narcissist My  f  grandmother   f  is a narcissist  I grew up in a different country than her but our limited interactions coupled with what my other family say about her confirm some pretty textbook traits  Perhaps as a result of some of the abuse by my grandmother  my mother  f  has some problematic issues that she refuses to get help for  When I was a teenager  she became a gambling addict  She is a pathological liar  she lies about things that don’t matter and things that matter a lot  She was also a lifetime smoker and now has lung cancer  which is luckily being managed  but getting accurate health information from her is damn near impossible unless I visit her provider with her  On top of the lying and the gambling  she is a martyr  All of these terrible things always happen to her despite her never doing anything wrong  She refuses to see a therapist or get help for her gambling addiction  She only quit smoking because the other option was dying  Being around her is really challenging for me  We recently had extended family in town and I had a really rough time listening to the lies and the martyrdom  I am in counseling since December but I still don’t feel like I’m making any progress with learning how to be less angry and frustrated with my mom  It seems like my best course of action would just be to see her less,1376,250
667,p7617o,0,4,How to deal with toxic parents while I’m living at home  Hi all I am a  year old male college student and I live at home with both my parents  My mom is not the toxic one  my dad is  My whole life I’ve always sought out approval from both of them  Over time  the approval came naturally from my mom but my dad would always have a hard time with that  Anything that is going well for me in life is always rained down with his constant negativity and pessimism  I can never truly be at ease when I’m alone with him in a car ride for example  I always feel like I have to have my guard up in conversations because he will talk about something in MY life and find some way to sprinkle some negativity in it making me question myself  I’ve always had to ask for permission to go out  even now at  years old  and he’s starting to say I don’t have to anymore  But I still feel the need to hear him say “yes”  I think this is a byproduct of the many years of control he’s had over me  I am tired of his toxic behaviors and I want to free myself from him and my need for his approval once and for all  Of course it will be hard since I see him everyday because I live at home  I plan on moving out once I graduate but right now there’s not much I can do  What can I do now,1274,261

672,p750zi,0,5,Not sure what the right thing to do is  When I was  or   I stole my brothers gameboy micro because I thought it looked cool  Im  now  I know it doesnt sound like anything too serious  but we had an extremely strained relationship growing up  Just to give an example  when I was much younger  my mom paid me allowance to keep an eye on my brother when she wasnt around just to report to her everything he did  She lied and told him she set up cameras in the house  which led him to believe his every move was being watched and when he found out  it completely shattered his trust and  to this day  he still has issues trusting people  Hes learned to make peace with me given what happened since I was so young and it was so long ago  Thats just one example of the many  many things our mother put us through  To get back to my main point   the GB micro was incredibly important to him and Id like to give it back after all these years  but Im afraid if he finds out that I took it  itll be a  last straw  type of deal and hell never be able to forgive me again  I feel like a vain POS for even caring at this point  I really should do the right thing and give it back  I just cant seem to push myself to do it out of fear of him cutting contact with me over it,1281,259

675,p74pf1,0,7,How do I rebuild my relationship with my mom when I haven’t forgiven her for years of neglect  So my mom was the kind of parent who never believed anything I said regarding my health  For example  when I had appendicitis I ended up laying on the bathroom floor after becoming violently ill  I had to beg my mom to take me to the er and she only agreed after I told her she could take the money out of my college fund  She claimed that she only knew I wasn’t faking because I offered to pay  She was also chronically guilty of medical neglect and dental neglect  All this to say  the medical care I received because of my moms selfishness was significantly worse than average  In first grade     I got a sinus infection  It was hurting me badly and I knew something was wrong because it sounded like I had pop rocks in my nose  My mom told me I was faking it to get out of school   until it spread to my chest  I was hospitalized because X rays showed that I had an acute lung infection and I was relying on multiple nebulizer treatments a day  A side effect they didn’t catch during this hospitalization was a protein deposit left by the infection  This deposit is sitting on my triageminal nerve and has caused a condition called triageminal neuralgia  which is regarded as the most painful condition you can have  I suffered from this condition from   without any treatment and only went to the doctor when my college roommate and her mom noticed that I was suffering from symptoms which didn’t align with plain migraines  I now take heavy dosages of anti convulsants and nerve pain medications to deal with the pain  I want to hate my mom for what she did to me  In   I cut my mom off entirely and used the pandemic to justify my absence  I thought it would be the end of the issue and I could focus on healing  Around Christmas  my little brother  the golden child  pointed out that our mom has never treated me “like a person” and  for whatever reason  this resonated with our mom  She began reaching out to check on me and buying me gifts   even when it wasn’t a holiday  She has told me she wants to rebuild our relationship and a part of me does agree  if only because I want just one parent  my dad died in    but the other part of me can’t forgive her  I don’t know if it’s because she won’t accept that her medical neglect had lasting consequences but I assume a part of the issue is just that she won’t accept that I need an apology to move foreword  She has addressed the social neglect of my childhood but refuses to acknowledge that other aspects of her parenting were abusive as well  Am I wrong to hold this against her,2661,498

681,p74cna,0,2,my n dad said he’d disown any of his kids who got vaccinated  i’ve received both doses one night my parents had a friend over to discuss vaccine conspiracy theories as some parents do  for some odd reason  and my sister was able to eavesdrop on some of their conversation  she heard my ndad say that he raised his children smart  intellectual  etc  and he’d disown anyone who received the vaccine behind his back  and so i’m going to uni in the fall and my plan to keep these vaccinations behind his back would’ve gone smoothly until my university stated that you  had  to be vaccinated to be on campus  no exceptions  my dad suspected that this was going to happen before the announcement was made and said that he wanted me to stay at home and do online school  which absolutely destroyed my mental health last year   i’ve already put in my first deposit on my house and my roommates are all expecting me to live with them so i can’t just pull out  so if i attend the university my dad will for sure know that i’ve been vaccinated  however  i’ve been wanting to go no contact or limited contact with him for a while so this could be the perfect opportunity  except i’d risk losing any help with college funds and i wouldn’t be able to see my siblings and pets very much  and i’d probably not have a place to come home to  counting down the days until my first semester has been pretty stressful especially since this could be my last year living at my house  my mom said she’d still try to help me but i’m not sure how much she can do if my dad attempts to prevent her from helping me  and usually she takes his side when we get into arguments not too sure where life will take me but it’d be nice if i could overcome this somehow,1735,326

684,p7434n,0,21,Was called a bitch today for setting my boundaries  I found out in therapy a few years ago that my father is a narcissist  It hadn’t occurred to me until then because after years of being blamed and shamed  I had come to learn that I was the problem in our relationship  He’s always been extremely controlling and growing up  he used his authority of being the only man in the house and being a police officer to his advantage  Since therapy  I’ve learned to establish boundaries  thanks to subreddits like this    and have since spent less and less time around him  The fact of the matter is  him and my mom are still together so I often go home to visit  She and I have a great relationship and I honestly wish she divorced him years ago  However  she is the enabler and the type of woman who allows herself to get walked all over  It’s a parental recipe for disaster  Even though I am  years old  married  have a solid job  have my own mortgage and am financially independent  my dad takes every opportunity to treat me like a child   ironically only when my husband isn’t around  Today  I was at my parents’ house without my husband and he raised his voice at me for not wearing socks in the house  he doesn’t like the marks bare feet leave his on floors   Just typing that out seems absolutely ludicrous but I’m sure everyone reading this can sympathize with the ridiculous of this  I calmly told him I would put my socks on and that all he had to do was ask nicely  that he didn’t have to yell at me like I was a child  That completely set him off  He started yelling even more talking about rules I set at my condo but then I don’t abide by his in his house  I decided it was time to leave and remove myself from the situation  I packed up my things  waved goodbye and said I was going to head home  My mom was sad and my dad burst into a hysteric screaming episode saying I was being ridiculous  I calmly stated I was setting my boundaries and distancing myself since I didn’t want to be talked to like that  That’s when he blew a gasket and screamed “Now you’re just being a BITCH ” As soon as those words came out of his mouth  I knew I was making the right decision  Because he lost the control of treating me that way and talking down to me  it made him angrier  I have to go back there this weekend as my sister is coming into town for her bridal shower and am unsure of how to go about this situation  He texted me today justifying his behavior first before apologizing and saying that bitch just “slipped ” The fact he reacted with that much hostility and emotional abuse over me leaving deeply disturbs me though and I’m heavily considering going NC but am wrestling with it since I don’t want my relationship with my mom to suffer  Would love any and all advice thoughts  Also  I just want to say HUGS to all of you who are experiencing a narcissistic parent  It’s been an emotional rollercoaster the past few years and even though we all have different situations and circumstances  I appreciate this forum and the people in it ♥️,3058,572

690,p73i4q,0,13,Hooray for generational trauma and parentification First time poster here  but Ill start with some background  I dont think my mom is a narcissist  but her mother definitely was and it definitely fucked her up  I had basically no relationship with my grandmother as a result and I think it was the right call on my moms part  Her mother died  years ago and now that Im in my s Ive started to recognize that a lot of what drives me crazy about my moms behavior can be traced to what happened to her  When I first learned the word parentification it was a lighting bolt moment because it summed up a lot of what went on when I was younger and what happened to my mom  My mom was undoubtedly parentified and I think it emotionally stunted her  Besides being abusive my grandmother was also an extremely brittle diabetic so my mom would often come home to find her mother passed out and have to revive her and my grandmother was apparently verbally abusive during this  There are countless stories like this but its clear their relationship wasnt good and getting away from her mother was the best thing that ever happened to my mom to the point of moving to the opposite side of the country where she met my dad and had me Now me  Theres that joke about  if you were called an old soul youre on at least one anti depressant now  which made me laugh in Lexapro and Wellbutrin  I very much was and everyone commented on it and by the time I was a teenager my mom seemed to not think of me as actually being a child  so I got put into the position of unpaid therapist since she and my dad were having marital problems at the time  Adult me realizes how wildly inappropriate it was but teenage me thought she was mature enough to handle it and said it was okay at the time  Adult me gets that teenage me wasnt even capable of making that call at the time and my mom should have known better than to put me in that situation  Well    maybe not so much on the last part  Because I wonder if she really didnt realize that wasnt okay for her to do to me since her mom used her the exact same way   Ive spent a lot of time working on now establishing boundaries and telling my mom that she cant use me as her unpaid therapist anymore but I still wonder exactly what her level of responsibility is here  So I guess thats my question as well as if it even matters,2378,450

692,p73dl7,0,2,My Nmom never had a good word to say about women  and so I grew up not able to have healthy relationships with other women  Then I realized I was bi pans…help  My mom was very critical of other women  I can’t think of one adult women that my mom didn’t shit talk “Girls gossip  Girls are mean  Girls will hurt you  Girls will leave you  You’re not enough  You have to do more ”She had very strict ideas about what it took to be a good woman  and no woman could measure up  including myself  “It’s a good thing we dressed you well for your choir concert  all of the other  rd graders  were dressed like little hookers ” “I know you like that shirt  but you can’t wear it with that jacket  brown and black aren’t colors that mix well  and the other girls will laugh at you ” “Oh that  insert woman’s girls name here  is such an  insert insulting word here  who probably  insert bad behavior here  ”I think my mom wanted to be the only woman in my life and was jealous of me spending time with other girls This made me insanely nervous to talk to girls  and had I exclusively male friends  I didn’t feel like a girl  I couldn’t relate to them  I expected them to hate me Later in life  I started going through puberty and realized I was really attracted to girls  From that point on  I became a flustered blushing mess whenever I talked to girls my age  This made it impossible to have relationships with women at all  I ended up marrying a great guy  because I like boys too  and that guy knows I’m bi and says he’s okay with me flirting with girls Even thinking about flirting with a girl makes me nervous and sweaty and like a teenager with a first crush  But I still have this deep seeded fear that women will reject and hate me  All my fantasies end with a girl realizing I’m not enough and leaving  It’s heartbreaking I want to explore my sexuality  but I’m terrified of doing so  It’s a difficult spot to be in If anyone has similar stories of how they overcame something like this  I’m all ears  What can I do to move forward from this pain,2065,379

699,p72rqf,0,6,How do narcs sabotage or control their childs life  Id like to know more about how narcissistic parents could control their child or sabotage them so that they never become independent or get married  Would it be possible to sabotage their career as well  Or their marriage  I feel crazy for thinking this and most of my family members cant see it but Im  and have never had a career or a real salary  I have made attempts but it always seems to never work out  I have never seen a yearly income of    or above and I have a business marketing degree  I also studied design and was heavily discouraged and competed against by my family  I wound up marrying a very talented designer and my brother tried to completely switch careers to go work at a design agency  He also tried to rip off my husbands design that he created from scratch and my Mother thinks he is an angel  My entire family competes with us and we were not supported by my parents when we got engaged  My mother took my wedding dress and claims she lost it    she has taken other things that belonged to me too  AND  she literally went through some of the wedding gifts and wouldnt allow me to take some of the gifts home  Later she gave me some weird distorted answer saying she thought my husband opened them which made NO sense  My mother has told family members NOT to call me  when I told her to leave me alone and she took it as her mission to tell people to not contact me  I cant prove that they control things but at this moment I have  savings   money in the bank and am living in their house with our child WITHOUT my husband due to covid because      wait for it    they claim that the house is too small and my husband cant stay here  So now we are living like a divorced couple and my husband is not even allowed to stay over or hardly even come over  He doesnt get to see his child  yet they are practically raising her  They told people my husband was a drunk after he was sent to the ER for having a complete break down and vitamin deficiency  They snubbed him and somehow tried to drive wedge between us but all these things I can not pin point and I feel like I am going crazy  I wish I could prove everything  My Dad is HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE  He is mean and verbally abusive and the entire family says  oh but hes a gentle nice guy  you should have compassion for him  The man ruined my entire life by screaming at me and my brother for years and ruining my ability to problem solve  I also now have memory problems and social anxiety  He sometimes would humiliate me in front of my friends too So I am so flustered by them and their behavior  there is just soo much that I can barely make sense of  so I apologize if some of this is just random  I am wondering how can one find out if they are playing games  being manipulative  or controlling when narcs do passive things and then claim they never did anything  I mean my father always  always tries to push me out of the way when I am in the kitchen cooking for the baby  or if I cook for them he stands next to me and tries to compete with me    literally  It makes you give up when they interfere like that but how can you prove it  That is also my question  how could you prove you arent crazy and they are,3267,627
700,p72aka,0,16,Was it abuse  People with experience with abuse  please help me make sense of my childhood   I have never been sexually abused or physically beaten the way other people have been  but I would still describe my childhood as difficult and abusive  Unfortunately  people do not think of other people as victims of abuse  unless they can come up with one single shocking traumatic event  Story of my life  Sorry for the long post  I already tried to shorten it and left many things out  Here are some of the things behaviors that happened throughout my childhood  in no particular order  My mom is a hoarder and has had very weird  intense  uncontrollable temper tantrums  Sometimes she would walk through our apartment  pulling her hair and punching herself in the head while screaming  Sometimes we had to wade through trash  and we had a lot of rotten and spoiled food at home  some of which was served to us  I had an eating disorder as a child and have never been too fond of eating to this day  She would sing uncontrollably and very loud in the kitchen  like a maniac  and my friends who came to visit would get scared  It was like in a mental hospital  really  My mom and my dad would regularly get into violent fights  sometimes involving kitchen knives  food or furniture being thrown at each other  Many things in our household were destroyed in my childhood and everyone took part in it  There is still a hole in the kitchen door today  from when my mom threw a knife at my dad My dad was an alcoholic and chain smoker  he also smoked inside  He often drove me around when he was very drunk and kept talking to me about how he would die soon  We were in bad accidents  one time the car spun over and landed on its roof on the highway   he lost his drivers license etc  at that time I didn’t care if I would die When I was  years old  he locked himself in the bathroom and announced to kill himself  I was crying outside  knocking at the door  begging him not to do it  This haunted me for many years My dad often used to disappear when he would go outside to run some errands and returned late in the night  sometimes with blood on his face from falling over  Sometimes he got into fights or the police would bring him home  even though he was never violent towards us   It was very embarrassing  since all our neighbors and many of my friends who lived in the same street were witness to it  My dad caused some very embarrassing situations  some of which I don’t want to mention here  He was always in debt and personified chaos For more than a decade and a half  my parents had very aggressive  vulgar  South Park got nothing on my parents and I learned as a baby how to seriously cuss  and frightening fights  for us as children  on a daily basis My mom would send us  around  and year old siblings  around the neighborhood to go look for my dad  even if it was in the middle of the night  One Christmas my dad disappeared  when he was out to go and get a Christmas tree  She sent us to look for him  We were scared to death and roaming the neighborhood looking for him holding hands  We found his car two subway stations away and he was in the trunk  so drunk that his eyes were rolled back  We dragged him back home and got ridiculed for it by people passing by  Well he got ridiculed  but we were ashamed to death  It really left a mark on us  Situations like this happened regularly  That day Christmas died for me and I have never liked it ever since  My mom never breastfed me and was very proud of it   She once told me when I was little  “Never make the same mistake as me and have children”  My sister   years older  used to change my diapers when I was a baby  She told me that I had rashes from my parents not changing my diapers for days  We never had any kind of connection  from the beginning As mentioned  my mom used to engage in very bizarre and odd behavior  Here are some examples  When we would take a shower  she would always use the hot water in the kitchen  which would turn the water ice cold in the bath tub  Every single time  Over many years  My sister and me used to get very mad at her for this  because it was so annoying  She would always have us wait at the lunch table for at least    minutes when food was already served and complain  violently and aggressively  if we already started eating and would also always make sure that she took  minutes more than us  after each of us finished  And we always had to wait for her  During vacations or daytrips  she would always walk at least  meters behind us and every time we would stop to wait for her  she would stop and wait until we would continue walking  Sometimes we lost her  One time she got robbed by a pickpocket and we screamed and gesticulated at her from afar  that someone was opening her purse  She stuck her fingers in her ears  as she would always do  when someone said something she didn’t want to hear  She always complained about everything and everyone being too loud but it was her who was screaming in a very annoying and aggressive way  All the time   She stole     which my dad saved for me starting when I was born  wasted it and lies to this day about it to me  My sister received the money  She liked my sister a little bit better than me and supported her in her career  while everything I was ever doing was stupid  senseless and I am not good enough for anything  She didn’t like men very much and any kind of affection for that matter  She never told me that she loved me or showed any affection  my dad was able to do that  despite his fuckups   Harsh criticism that borders  and sometimes involved hatred  and no affection or reassurance ever for me  I was her biggest mistake  She had vulgar explosions of anger that remind me of the movie The Exorcist  Really  you wouldn’t believe it  if you saw her  My wife didn’t believe me  until she saw it herself  Nobody knows she is like this  besides us  The rest of the world thinks she is a very nice and kind lady and they don’t understand what is wrong with me and why I am not thankful for this nice little lady  When my dad got terminally ill with cancer  she used to beat him up  He wasn’t able to defend himself anymore because he was slowly on the way out  Every time she demanded something stupid or ridiculous of me and I wouldn’t oblige  she would beat him up  I would get a call by him  begging me to comply with her will next time  because otherwise she would beat him up again  It made me angry like you wouldn’t believe  which didn’t make the situation better  One time I caught her attacking him and grabbed her by the collar  I told her that I would knock her the fuck out  if she ever touched my dad again  who was very very ill  I am not proud of it  but I was sooo angry  I never went hungry  well  let me correct myself  she always used to cook very small portions  because she thought eating too much isnt good  so often times I left the lunch table hungry  Later when I would visit them I ate in advance  knowing she would either cook very little or something disgusting  To this day  when I cook  I compulsively cook too much  always having that fear in mind to go to bed hungry   had toys  went on some nice vacations  but it still messed me up that it is affecting me to this day  My mom isn’t an inherently evil person and she has some good in her  she just never loved me and always used me as her punching bag with no mercy  I have had huge issues regarding women for a very long time My dad died  years ago  my mom is still alive  I feel indifferent towards her and I feel sorry for her  But I don’t love her  What are your thoughts on this Thanks for reading through this and any input is welcome  I left many things out  but this is too long already  so I am thankful for any opinion,7836,1475

703,p726q8,0,9,Is it shameful to have done bad things  Am I a bad person if I’ve done bad things  My biggest fear in life is being a bad person  My mom was an asshole growing up who always criticized everything I did  who was always cold towards me  compared me to others  etc  I was never capable enough  didn’t work hard enough  wasn’t mature enough  etc  But  most of all  I was never enough of a good person  There was always this theme in our relationship of her looking down on me and being disappointed and upset with me as a person  From the age of six onwards  I can remember feeling a deep sense of shame about myself and felt like I didn’t deserve to exist in life  I’ve been in therapy for four years now  I’m    My therapists over the years have tried very hard to ingrain in me that I’m not a bad person  but I find it very  very hard to believe  The thing is  I’ve done some messed up things throughout my life as a result of untreated feelings and issues from my childhood  I won’t bore you all with the details  but I’m no saint  For this reason  I can never  ever rid myself of this core childhood pain  this fear  that I’m a bad person  I walk around everyday with this fear that people will find out I’m bad  with this feeling of deep shame that I am even taking up space in the world  overthinking all of my actions and trying so hard everyday to be “perfect” to ensure that I never do anything bad ever again  But it never works  I inevitably end up messing up  and sometimes messing up big time and doing something really bad    I don’t know what to do about all of this  I’ve often told my therapists that I think I would be more accepting of the fact that I am not a bad person  that I would be more compassionate towards myself  if society treated “being a good person” as a skill to be learned akin to learning to ride a bike or learning how to cook  If society didn’t shame people who have done bad things so much and make them feel like shit  I would probably be a lot softer and compassionate towards myself  But  the thing is  I am not the world’s best person  I’m no saint  I’m working hard everyday to correct the fucked up behaviors from childhood  but it’s harder for me than other people because I am learning all of this now as an adult  I don’t want to spend every waking moment worrying about whether something I’m doing is bad or fucked up because that sort of perfectionism makes me hate myself more  but I feel like I have to because the world doesn’t treat morality or “being a good person” the same way they treat learning other skills  I often see people online  on Twitter and Reddit  especially places like r AmITheAsshole   completely shame and crucify those who fuck up in some way  and it makes me eternally afraid of ever doing anything wrong and makes me hate myself for all the bad things I did in my past  My question is  how do I rid myself of the shame and fear I have about being a bad person when other people make it seem like I deserve to feel ashamed for those things  Or do I deserve to feel guilty and ashamed for my fuck ups after all  Do they make me a bad  shameful person,3134,598

709,p715o0,0,6,Stop crying or I wont take you to the hospital  In third grade my Nmom took me to her friends house who had a son that would always fight with me  I always told her I didnt want to go to the friends house because of it but she still made me go  Of course how it always goes when we go to her friends I was outside playing her the kid and his friend came up to me and the kid started fighting me  I obviously tried my best till he stepped on my left foot and pushed me down keeping his foot on mine breaking all my toes  The kid still wanted to be me even while I was screaming from pain but thank god his friend stopped him  The kids mom came out not mine  to see what was going on and saw something was clearly wrong with my foot  My Nmom came out telling me and her friend a story of how she broke her foot when she was a kid and walked it off so I clearly didnt break mine  The friend carried me to Nmoms care being the saint she is and told my mom to take me to the hospital  On the drive there I was still crying and she flipped out and said  I swear if you do not stop crying you are not going to the hospital    So me wanting to go I got my mp and started playing music till I stopped crying  Nmom signals for me I take out my earbuds and she simply says  since youre not crying youre obviously fine and dont need to go to the hospital   and boom waterworks again  She took me to the hospital but said if my foot wasnt broken and I made her waste her time for nothing Id be grounded  Well it was broken and put into a cast the look on her face when the doctor told her it was broken made me feel slightly better  This also happened before Halloween  favorite Holliday  and the friend made her son give me his candy so it was a slight win ig,1757,364

715,p706vt,0,4,Manufacturing reasons for contact I write and sometimes publish poetry  My late father also wrote poetry  but published very little in his lifetime  After he died  five and a half years ago  my mother brought out a self published volume of his poems  I helped to compile that  though she ignored my suggestion of leaving out some weaker  possibly unfinished pieces  and wrote the foreword  I never asked about sales  but would be surprised if my mother recouped the publishing costs  My mother and I have always had a toxic relationship  see my post history  and I went NC over two years ago  Well  initially I meant to go VLC  but within two weeks of my asking her not to contact me till further notice  she was emailing me with the excuse of discussing some poems Id recently published  That made me realise that blocking all contact was the only way forward  I havent regretted it once  Recently shes been trying to contact me again about  rights to the poetry   I dont know whose poetry  because I only saw the subject line as the email disappeared into the void  but I assume its my dads   I retain copyright over my own work   and she should know this   She holds the copyright now as his heir  so I guess its about who shes going to leave it to in her will  Dad wasnt a bad poet  bless him   but far better poets have been forgotten  The odds of anyone wanting to republish his poetry  or of it earning any money  are incredibly low  There is no pressing reason for her to contact me about this  and I know from experience that shes trying to manipulate me  picking a subject she thinks I cant resist to worm her way back into my life  Its so transparent and it makes me so angry,1705,311

719,p6zfgs,0,4,My son will be born in  months but I feel deeply depressed    Hello  guys I don’t engage much with the community here on Reddit  but I’m always lurking around  This is the only social media that I really enjoy using I need some advice I’m writing this because I don’t have many friends that I can share this stuff with and my anxiety has been tearing me apart I’m  years old and currently going through some really bad stuff in my head that I’m having trouble processing I need to take this off my chest and I thought this would be a good place to express myself and maybe someone could help me out  People here are usually quite wholesome  cheerful and wise So… months from now I will become a father I am really excited about it and I love my fiancée very much  This girl literally changed my life I came from a very poor and messed up family  I grew up without a father and had a really resentful mother who was very negative and toxic I have so much shit inside me  so much hate and sadness about how my family treated me growing up  I have nightmares about it every other day  it sucks I used to cry almost every night about my mother ignoring the fact that a member of her family raped me when I was a child  Seriously  this isn’t the kind of thing I can simply ignore  it causes me a lot of daily pain As I grew up I turned into a cold  manipulative person  I told horrible lies and used people as it pleased me  I’ve hurted so many people along the yearsBut then I met Sabrina She was this super dorky girl who worked as a teacher and had such a pure heart  She really is the best person I’ve ever met We met  years ago through an ex friend and then we started dating immediately  After only a year  we decided to live together During this time I cheated on her several times I was having affairs at work  seeing hookers frequently and on top of this I was snorting cocaine everyday I had this wonderful girl that I was putting through so much horrible stuff  And she loved me so  so  so very much   In time  I started to feel very guilty But soon COVID  hitted and things got really bad here in Brazil Our money situation got critical and we couldn’t pay rent anymore  so we had to go back and live at my mom’s house During these hard times  I was starting to feel something different inside Through time  Sabrina was making me feel more open and honest with her and myself Her kindness inspired me and the love I felt for her made me want to change because I couldn’t bear feeling that guilt anymore I didn’t want to hurt her anymore  she was too good to me…But I was so scared of her finding out the horrible things I’ve done   At this point an immense struggle started happening inside of me and I began to reflect upon the concepts of good and evil As I started to be honest with myself I realized how much of a shitty person I was… and it was really hard to accept that In July  I confessed everything I told her everything I’ve done behind her back and who I really was  This was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life She cried so much  it looked like she was vomiting pain… I felt like a monster I was a monter She broke up with me and went away to a friend’s house  She lived with her friend for a while Sabrina doesn’t have any family  Her parents don’t give a fuck about her existence and they live at the other side of the country She was feeling like she never knew me at all and must have felt so alone…At this point I was really trying to be a better person  I started to study the concept of good and evil which got me into philosophy  buddhism  psychology and mysticism I was desperate to cast this monster out and find some good in myselfI tried so hard to change myself and help Sabrina  She was living in really bad conditions over at her friend’s house But after some months  her friend kicked her out and she had no choice but to come back to live with me at my mother’s house Yeah  I know that sounds like an obvious bad move but I couldn’t leave her homeless  It was the only viable option And things between us were bad Even though she was trying to make things work between us  it was obvious she resented me a lot We talked about this  tried to sort things out  There was a lot of crying and guilt and resentment  It was really ugly Situation was really stressful because we had no money and my mother was treating us like shit  like she really hated us for being there I was spiraling in depression The house was dark  smelled like cigarettes and cheap beer Watching how my mother was living and what she has turned into after years of being a sad person was killing me inside Some time later  Sabrina got a job as a gym receptionist in a dangerous favela here in Rio Things with my mom got worse After a big argument over something stupid  my mother tried to hurt Sabrina  That’s when she decided to just leave and sleep on the streets rather than keep living with me like that I remember having a complete mental breakdown that day  And in a very dark way  I also remember noticing that my mom looked quite entertained by my own despair Luckily  the lady who owned the gym in which Sabrina worked gave her the key so she could sleep on the gym’s floor Meanwhile  things here in Brazil were crazy  It was impossible to find a job  no one was hiring  corruption scandals over hospitals  vaccines  amp  shit Everything was pretty apocalyptic by that time I started doing some graphic designs on Canva and made a bit of money on freelancer com  Started studying SEO  Copywriting and did some jobs online My English was also pretty decent because I spent my entire childhood playing RPG games on my Playstation So I started teaching English  I only had one student  but that’s an improvement  right Time has passed and Sabrina got back to teaching  Soon enough she was back on her feet and rented an apartment This amazing girl is a freaking heroine  I know Meanwhile  I was making internal progress  confronting my demons and trying really hard to be a good person while also trying to help my mother But living with my mom was putting me in a really dark place…And that’s when Sabrina got pregnant  We were still seeing each other every other day  so it kinda happened accidentally I am really grateful for her forgiveness  I am very grateful for having this second chance   At first I was really scared  but Sabrina didn’t think twice She said that she would be raising our kid whether I was going to be a part of it or not Two months ago she invited me to move in together  even though I’m making less than a U D  around  Reais in our currency  per month I am very happy for finally being forgiven by this women  but now I’m battling against this feeling of being a fucking deadweight on her life Our relationship is better than ever and I’ve been taking care of Sabrina with all my heart She is a pregnant woman  working her ass off  paying rent  taking care of me and our dog financially Sabrina is the strongest and kindest person I know As she is juggling a lot of classes to make money  I sit at my computer and try to score any freelancing job I can But things are rough right now Soon she won’t be able to work anymore  she’s  months pregnant  and I’m not providing yet I’ve sent out so many resumés  tried out so many ways of making money online…Even though Sabrina and I have been very happy together  we are starting to get worried about our situation I’m trying my hardest  I really am  I try to keep the house spotless clean  I cook for her  take care of our dog Everyday I get on the internet and try to score some gig so I can help out  but… fuck  I’m starting to feel like a useless piece of shit…I feel small  pathetic and powerless  Maybe that’s stupid  but I feel like less of a man…With all that happening inside me  emotionally  I closed myself off to the world I don’t talk to anyone else except Sabrina because I feel so ashamed of myself Also I changed so much because of everything that happened that I don’t even know how to introduce my new being to my old friends My friends reach out and ask if I’m okay but I always end up ignoring them    and this hurts me so much because I miss affection and validation from friends like everyone else…I just feel like I don’t want people to see me until I fix my situation   And this has been going for a while now  I feel so alone and worthless and ashamed to let anyone see me like this It got to a point that I decided to live my life to serve my family  Not as a penitence  but because it’s really the only way I can feel good about myself again   I promised myself I will serve my wife Sabrina  my son Raziel and my dog Coyote Today I woke up  made breakfast and cleaned the apartment for my wife She left for work and I tried to write some stuff for an idea I had to get some English students I’ve always been quite a nerd  so I’m working on this idea of teaching English classes through tabletop RPG games As I tried to work on my project today  I felt really sad…There is a rage of feelings and fear inside of me  I often have nightmares about my family or losing Sabrina As the days go by  I feel that my anxiety gets better because Sabrina helped me break free of my mother’s toxicity But yet  it feels like I still have a long way to go…After some time of us not speaking  my mother texted me yesterday and said she missed me  It made my heart ache again  really bad Today I kept trying to write stuff for my English teaching project or to just get stuff done around the house but…Fuck  I feel bad But… I have no time to just feel depressed  I need to provide for my family and the clock is ticking My son is about to be born and I feel so powerless How do I make this feeling go away   Tell me  friends from Reddit  how do I stop feeling so overwhelmed by my own sadness Now that I am trying to be honest with myself and my own feelings I realize that this is almost impossible Facing life with honesty is really hard and I’m trying my best  but…How do you guys do this  Adult life is kicking my ass and facing it with honest emotions are just making it even harder As the days go by  life feels lighter and brighter  It’s been a while since I had nightmares and my mind feels clearer But there’s still this fear that I have to conquer inside myself of not being able to provide for my family   I guess that’s what it means becoming a father  right Well  anyway  thanks for reading I really needed to get this off my chest,10682,1912

727,p6ylcc,0,4,TW SEXUAL ABUSE    How do I start a legal case against my dad  How do I start the legal process against my dad for molesting me and my little brother  I’m f  will be  in April  he is m I plan on taking custody and most likely leaving my mom as well  We will be staying with my bfs family in our own room and I already have a plan to relatively quickly transition us into a stable apartment and give us the best life we can have  I will be doing contracting work and making hundreds per job almost daily  it’s all set in stone  My bfs dad is the kindest person I’ve ever met second only to my bf and is more than happy to let me and my brother stay their spare bedroom as long as we need  I actually will be working with him for the contracting  I also have my own car and although I have a provisional license  I am allowed to drive myself and my little brother to school work  and in three months I’ll be able to take the drivers test and get my full license  I’ve began collecting what little evidence I do have which is primarily screenshots of searches he has made on his devices to see his step daughter  my older sisters nudes  an email which I have been documenting as much detailed abuse as possible  me and my brothers testimony  I found a local facility that will help with getting my brothers testimony and they do it in a very comforting non pressuring way and they film it so he doesn’t have to repeat it to fifty different people and they can help me get my brother into counseling  So far legally all I understand about guardianship is that to prove I can handle him I need to show I can provide housing  essentials  medical care  and stability  For immediate housing  we have a spare bedroom at my bfs house however I have a clear and detailed plan of the work that I   will be doing and a list of apartments that one we will move in to when I have the money  Since I will be working Immediately I will be able to provide clothes  food  doctors visits etc and someone who is willing to support us as back up  Stability wise  again I will be stable working and have options for a second job on top of that  I plan on enrolling my brother immediately in counseling through the facility that will help with the interview  I myself am mentally stable and ever since I was his age I’ve been raising him myself  I changed His diapers fed him bottles and food put him to sleep gave him baths and have always been his emotional support  He would tell anyone if asked that I am here for him and the one he goes to and he has stated in the past without me even prompting the conversation that he wants to live with me  I just really need to figure out what the legalities here are and what the process will look like and what steps I need to take for that and how to get a guardianship lawyer if I need one  Additionally I need to decide if we leave this month or if we are willing to wait in this hell hole another two months to see if our mom who has temporarily moved in will be able to get a house  see other post for current situation details  and hopefully not relapse  But again their are a million things that can go wrong with her and I originally planned on after we move in with her taking my brother anyways just it would be easier from her house and I wouldn’t have to burden my bf and his dad  Thank you for any and all advice,3359,654

735,p6xq4j,0,2,At least you can take some time to dissect text messages as opposed to offhand verbal abuse     TW  Gaslighting Abusive Narcissistic Messages      You know how they talk  If you cant stand that  please dont read this  I just want to see what people think of some of the things my  f  nMom  f  has been saying recently  I keep thinking Im going crazy  the gaslighting is getting to me Im sure  Im currently forced to live with her because my only other option is homelessness  Im trying to get a job but I have severe anxiety and my job coach has been    slow  Applying is terrifying and Im dissociating most of the day  which makes me feel like Im not trying  Cant get emergency housing  have no relatives  friends  or anyone I could stay with instead  that arent also abusive   For context  I have a car  but my nMom has been using it since I was forced to move back in with her  It ran okay before  but its old  and shes completely destroyed the thing  The car wont even start unless its jumped  and it has to be driven constantly or else the battery will die  Ive asked her repeatedly to please fix it  because I have no money  and shes said she has but obviously if it keeps doing that it isnt fixed   She says it doesnt need to be fixed  it needs to be driven which is just an excuse to make me feel like Im not being responsible and for the car to be unavailable when I need it the most   AKA leaving Heres the first message  sent August th  Around  am  gt   Good morning       My Deadname       I want to say to you that I have been nice long enough about your car I haven’t yelled I haven’t come on glued yet and I was nice enough to get your car started for you  But today is my breaking point and if your car is not moved out of that man’s parking spot by the time I get home from work I am going to blow a gasket literally your car needs to be started driven and taken care of and I am not gonna be nice anymore I’ve absolutely had it I do love you though  For more context  I hadnt driven the car in months  she had been driving it  and she was the one who put it in our neighbors parking spot  I dont even know where visitor parking is  Notice how she says  I was nice enough  as if she actually did something lmao  She jumped my car out of the kindness of her heart yet didnt park it in the right spot   And blames it on me  How surprising  And for the record  I did go out there and see if the car would start  another surprise  it didnt start  I have ADHD and I forget the car even exists most of the time  which is why I cant just drive it every day either She sent this message later in the day when she got home from work  gt   I’m going out for a beer   When I get home that car better be moved or the internet is off   And it will not be turned on again until you can be responsible to take care of your car  clean your bathroom and bedroom  and you are paying rent  Internet is a privilege that you haven’t earned   I do love you   But you need to show some responsibility and respect   Shes been threatening that I need to pay rent since I moved here three years ago  Yes  I still havent been able to get a job  I know  Doesnt exactly feel great  I kinda feel worthless actually  But when I first moved in I had been kicked out by my nDad  who had promised me college and that hed help me get a job  only to kick me out because his eGirlfriend was more important  later eWife   I moved in depressed  anorexic  and straight up not having a good time  My anxiety is really bad  and my CPTSD from my parents gives me a huge fear of failure  so much so that I worry more about being a burden to my hypothetical employers than I do about still being abused here  Not fun  Shes also threatened the internet frequently enough over the time Ive been here  which is just her flaunting her control over me  really  Plus  my only chance at a job is online work so of she keeps me from using the internet I literally cannot save up to leave  Id say shes also threatening my healthy communication with friends but I dont have friends  Whoops  I told her after this that I did go out and try to start the car  but she brushed it off and didnt care   Almost like she just wanted to complain at me and be the center of attention    Hmmmmmmm kinda sus buddy She sent me this a few hours ago  gt   How about if you’re not going to talk to me  or help with anything around the house without being paid  you move to your dads house  I deserve more respect  I deserve love   If you have no respect for me and no love for me  you are free to go to your dads or your own apartment   I’m giving you and your       Sibling       until January st to get jobs and pay rent  utilities and groceries  move  or be enrolled in school  The choice is yours  No more free rides  It’s for your own good  Because I love you both   Once again  for context  Ive been doing my best to avoid her this past month or    six  I do my best to say in my room  and only come out to eat or shower etc  I havent spoken to her face to face for a few days  and when that happens she claims that Im ignoring her  She even perpetuates it by purposefully trying to come home as late as possible  when Ive already gone to bed   But I try to go to bed by the time she gets home so I can eat when shes asleep  Lately Ive just been not going downstairs at all when shes home  though   Its hilarious that shes threatening me with this  because I know what she really wanted to say was  dont get a job  apply for college instead so you can keep staying with me and being my supply   Thats what the point of this was  I think  She doesnt actually want me to leave  Shes been purposefully keeping me from leaving since I got here  which is part of the reason as to why its been so hard in the first place So whats so bad about moving back in with my nDad  then  His eWife  actually  I hate everything she stands for  Shes insanely racist  homophobic  transphobic  the lot   I mean  my whole family is  but   The last time I saw my nDad I made the mistake of bringing up how the minimum wage isnt a living wage and things just got worse from there  until I was crying on my way out the door  He sat in front of me while I was having a breakdown and told me I wasnt trying and my generation is lazy  how hes done everything for me and Im ungrateful and attacking him  I brought up my nMoms abuse  his abuse  and his eWifes abuse  and his reply was well at least I didnt hit you   He did by the way lmaooo  His eWife is very I deserve respect because I exist and anything that isnt exactly what I said is disrespect  She abused her children  too  who abuse their children as well  How wonderful  So yeah  things are shit right now  I just wanted someone to tell me I wasnt going crazy  and that this isnt okay  Its really hard being isolated for so long  I dont have anyone to remind me that I didnt do anything wrong  The global panini didnt change a single thing about my situation besides my nMom inviting c positive people to live with us  which was fun   Thats sarcasm  I hope to fuck Im not gonna end up sick in a few days   Again  all Im able to do is dissociate most of the day  Applying to jobs is incredibly stressful  and my ADHD paralysis makes it even harder to start  I dont have any work experience  and Im even terrified to work because I worry Ill screw something up  I have a job coach  but shes got cancer and is struggling herself  so I dont even have her working full time to help me  plus she has other clients   I havent been taught anything about anything  including taxes  paychecks  literally any adult shit  So going in blind makes it even worse  which makes it hard to even start  Looking at job listings actually makes me cry because I get so overwhelmed  Every time I just get lost in it sometimes  Lost in the story my nParents write  Its insane how they completely insert their own self obsessed bullshit into the core beliefs of fucking children  How they convince us that were worthless and have no worth outside of praising them  Im so deprived that phone calls with doctors and my job coach are just a few words away from becoming a therapy session  And I get stuck between forcing my FAWN response on random people  because my trauma makes me expect them to be upset for literally nothing  and desperately begging for help for myself  Its mental  Did I mention were in a housing crisis and in many places in the US that sleeping in your car is illegal   So even if my car did work thats not an option how awesome  D  I wouldnt have internet connection if I had an online job anyways so living in my car isnt sustainable anyways      Speaking of   if you have some living homeless tips Id greatly appreciate it     because    well,8878,1659

738,p6x7aw,0,5,Im at my wits end TW MENTIONS IF SUICIDE AND SELF HARMI need an anonymous place to rant so here it is  Im immensely dumfounded by my mothers approach to parenting  When I was  it came to my schools attention that I had been self harming  they informed her of course and she had one short conversation with me about it and it was never brought up again  The school wanted to organise an appointment with the nurse to discuss this and when I attended she had called my mum beforehand and the two of them decided I was just  trying it out  because I had friends that did it  Everything I told the nurse after that was pointless because shed made up her mind  Honestly this absolutely enrages me because I was actually trying to get help at the time and if I had gotten it I wouldnt be covered in scars like I am now  More recently my depression hit the lowest its ever been and I finally sought help  I told my parents about it  more because my sister was worried about me than because I wanted to  Again she barely mentioned it except to ask me  why are you actually depressed  Like what reason    Due my depression Ive been signed off of work multiple times during different break downs and all shes done is tell me Im going to lose my job and I cant quit because no one will ever hire me again if I do  I told her my job genuinely makes me want to kill myself and she just said  oh come on thats a bit much  I responded  well no Im literally depressed  but she just shrugged that off  Shes genuinely the kind of person thatll treat me like that but if I ever did commit suicide shed be announcing to everyone how hard she tried to help me etc   Ive been exploring online at the possibility of me having ADHD as its been a running joke in my family that I have it and I think itd really put everything into perspective for me  She doesnt even want to entertain this and clearly thinks its ridiculous despite my therapist urging me to speak to a doctor about it because she thinks its likely  I mentioned to her that Ive seen a lot of people get questionnaires for their family to fill out about any behaviour they may have noticed and all she said  very bluntly was  hm well see   She also started informing me of all her marital issues and just bad mouthing my dad whenever he isnt around  My dad isnt a perfect man but these grievances she has are honestly ridiculous and most of the time I can see where hes coming from  For example  she wanted to take a large amount of money from HIS pension to redo the house and he said no  he gave no reason but its no secret that shes terrible with money to the point where Ive had to pay her mortgage and loan her money frequently  Shes also particularly annoyed when my dad is unwell  he has lung disease and often gets infections that are quite serious  she says she has no sympathy for the  dying duck  act and gets angry when hes clearly struggling but if she were ill it would be a completely different story   I cant even talk about any of this with her because if I even imply shes a bad parent all hell would break loose  It would all be flipped onto me and shed stop talking to me all together which isnt ideal as Ive recently had to move back home  Something in me today snapped during dinner  i was talking to my dad and she just loudly cut me off to inform him of some stupid post shed seen on Facebook  I just felt defeated and stayed silent for the rest of my meal  Its becoming more and more clear that she doesnt care about anything that isnt to do with her and I just dont know how to cope anymore  If any of you stuck around this long thank you for taking the time to listen to a depressed bitch complain,3723,710

744,p6wmws,0,7,My anti vaxxer parents Sorry for posting here  times today but I just had a brief touch on the covid subject with my narc parents and I just couldnt believe the amount of lies they spewed on me  My NF has always believed the virus is a hoax  conspiracy cooked up by the evil government  and he keeps saying this to absolutely anyone willing to listen  My NM thinks Covid is JUST a flu in spite of the examples I gave her of my friends with sick parents in the hospital  My mother even has friends acquaintances who were in the hospital from Covid and she talked to them after recovery  YET shes still in complete denial of how severe this virus is  As you imagine theyre both unvaxxed and theyll never touch the vaccine  Unfortunately  theyre in the vulnerable category high blood pressure  obesity etc  So my fear is that  when Ill call them later on in a couple of months  theyll both be fighting the virus AND  theyll continue to deny the virus affected them in any way  Of course I am worried for them because they barely practice social distancing but I cant do anything about it  No one is able to convince these people that were currently dealing with the most dangerous flu virus that had ever been around and Im weary theyll suffer the consequences of that  Its so sad and ridiculous if you ask me  Are your narcissistic parents ad in denial of the pandemic as mine  How are you dealing with their delusion on a mental level,1464,263

748,p6wflr,0,2,Scared for my future Hi everyone  I’ve never actually spoken to anyone about my parents before  so this is a bit scary  but I’m having a really tough time right now and just need a safe place to rant and get advice Here’s some context  sorry but this is gonna be a long one…When I was  my parents forced me to move  hours from my hometown even though I had taken a very long time to find a stable friend group  and was finally happy  I had a really hard time with bullying and getting used to the new requirements standards at my new school  so eventually I decided to move to an online school  This was a hard time in my life but on the bright side I ended up graduating like  months early  while I was still  Since I was still considered out of state I told my parents that my plan was to work for the rest of the year and then to start college when I was  like I would have if I had graduated at my normal time  I didn’t want to pay x as much to start school early  and I was only making   an hour at the time  so I figured saving up and starting normally was the smartest thing to do  My parents were furious over this and forced me to start college at  because “they weren’t going to foot my bills for any longer than they had to” and because “I wasn’t owed anything just for being alive ”I ended up only taking  classes that first semester because it was all I could afford  and  classes the following one  This is what most people take in a single semester  but my parents refer to this as “my first year” and have told me that I need to finish up my entire degree in  more years or I’m going to be kicked out This has put huge strain on me both emotionally and financially by forcing me to take  classes some semesters  and by forcing me to pay for summer classes out of pocket to get caught up  My parents are very well off financially  and told me my whole life they would “help” pay for my school  but they have paid barely any at this point  and won’t even allow me to go to the doctor unless I pay for it  Currently I’m in the midst of my junior year  but because of some messed up shenanigans and the pandemic  I am only given the   sophomores get in Federal loans  Because of this I still have a few grand each semester I have to pay out of pocket  not counting books  parking passes  etc  I’m trying very hard to avoid private loans because starting pay for my future career is only k  so I need to be very careful with how much debt I incur  as well as with interest rates  Before I could just work I order to pay this  but as I get farther into my degree  I’m an education major  I’m starting to have field placements and much harder classes that are making it difficult for me to reasonably work more than  hours a week  I am on campus from am to pm  days a week and I work  hours every weekend  but it’s not enough  I also have   I need to come up with for summer classes again this summer  but I don’t know how I’m going to make it  My school just keeps hitting me with more and more fees  and my parents blame it all on my “laziness ”All of this is starting to take a tole on me  I’m exhausted all the time  I’ve noticed my driving is getting bad  I’m having awful nightmares  I don’t eat well  my grades are slipping  and even my coworkers have noticed that “I always seem sad ” I feel like I’m not strong enough to do what I need to on my own  and I’m scared  Now onto my parents… My parents are the kinds of parents who like to pass of neglect as a life lesson  Despite being very well off financially they would very often refuse to buy me clothes that fit as a kid  take me to the doctor dentist regularly  or even to cook meals regularly  They always justified this by telling me that “that’s life” or by repeating their mantra… “you aren’t owned anything just for being alive ” They also had issues with alcohol when I was younger as well as with allowing my   year old family members to drink and behave badly in front of me  but this grew better over time They constantly threaten me financially  and will threaten to kick me out over small things like leaving a cup on the counter  or forgetting to turn off a lamp  And as I mentioned before  they refuse to pay for any of my college  and I’m struggling with that as well  I have a very difficult time accepting help from anyone because growing up “help” was always something that would get held over my head later on  My parents would rarely do nice things for me  but when they did  there was always a price  My mother would often tell me she was going to buy me things only to make me put them back at the checkout counter stating that “daddy will scream at me if I spend too much ” This was often done with clothing  school supplies  etc  They also very much like to “embellish” their past accomplishments and then use them as an excuse to call me lazy  The current lie they like to manipulate me with is…“Your mother paid for her    a year degree when she was making   an hour  She didn’t have any loans  so you don’t have any right to complain ”This is blatantly false and would mean that my mother would have somehow managed to work  hours a week   weeks out of the year  all while being a full time student  A quick google search also shows that tuition to her college was    a year when she went  not     Anyways  I feel like over getting a bit sidetracked  and this is way too long  so let me put it simply…  My parents don’t give off the vibe that they like me  let alone love me    They treat me like a huge burden  and for years have made me feel guilty for being alive   I have a hard time taking about this with anyone because they don’t physically abuse me  and because we are well off financially  I feel like an ungrateful crybaby a lot of the time   They make me feel like everything wrong with the world is my fault  and lie to me in order to make me feel inadequate   I am scared for the future of my finances as well as for my schoolingI’m sorry this was so long  but I really just needed to rant  and writing this felt good  Does anyone else here have similar circumstances  and if so  how are you managing  how did you manage  Thank you,6249,1204
749,p6wf03,0,2,Fucking why My nmom is obsessed with me   Just gonna say it  I had hunches but at this point I am pretty sure that obsession is the right word  amp  xB I have been buying shirts off redbubble  They are just cool shirts that are personal to me   but I can also get away with wearing it in public and not feel weird I walk by my nmom just now and guess what  Shes wearing a shirt from the same franchise as one of my shirts  She usually just wears other stuff not relating to this particular thing  She saw my shirt  got jealous and bought a similar shirt to spite me   Generally she pretends to be too cool or mature to wear stuff like this Part of me just wants to burn my shirts now  but moreso I just want to not visual see her ever again  Unfortunately that wish wont be granted  In that case  I just have to remind myself that what shes doing has nothing to do with me  I can still like my shirts even though shes doing whatever shes doing,961,181
750,p6w9s9,0,2,Am I wrong for calling out my father on his behaviour of me  Since Im his child and he raised me the  best  he could is it wrong if me to call him a bad father According to me he has always been financially abusive  He makes me feel guilty for every penny he spends on me to the point that I think about whatever I need a thousand times before I go ask him for it and even then Im scared shitless that he will not allow me to have it On top of that he holds everything he spends on me over my head    but indirectly  So to me he will say nothing  but he will go to my mom and say oh look I spend  on getting her a root canal for example  And when I say Im his responsibility and he has no right to guilt trip me about it  If he didnt want to spend money on his kids why have them in the first place    he gets all butt hurt saying he is doing the best he can Keep in mind he gets a good salary and is very well off  But he hates spending any of this money on us     of his salary goes into a bank account that only he has access to and this has been the way for as long as I know  And no it not being invested  its just sitting in the bank losing value every single day  I understand and believe in the concept of savings but what he does is  in my opinion  overboard And me calling him out puts me in a bad position with my family because according to them he does so much for us and Im still an ungrateful little b  ch towards him and I should be more grateful for all that he has done for us Umm    isnt that his responsibility  He made the choice of getting married and having kids  If he was not willing to spend any of his money on his family why bother having a family in the first place  Its not a necessity to have a family even if you dont want to  No gun was being held to his head to go and get married  It was a freaking choice of his   He made that choice  Now he should live up to it    in my opinion,1942,398

755,p6vuox,0,7,Are my parents narcissistic  Hello everyone – My parents have always had moments where they were inconsiderate and disrespectful of me   But I came across the idea of narcissistic parents recently and am wondering if mine fit the bill   Some examples  When I was applying to college and considered going away to school  my mothers response was   Why do you need to go away to school anyway  You could just go to the community college and become a secretary  Thats good enough   I went back to school for two Masters degrees  and my mothers response during the second one was   Arent you tired of studying already   During my teen years  my dad reprimanded me for putting menstrual pads in the garbage where he could see them  He said   I knew about that well before you were even born  I dont need to see it in the garbage   He was an hour late to my high school graduation because  my mother didnt remind him   When I was dating in college  he gave me the white wedding dress speech   When you were born  all I ever wanted was to one day walk you down the aisle in a white wedding dress and know that you deserved to be in it  However  now as an adult  I feel they continue to cross boundaries that my husband and I agree are inappropriate for grown adults with their own home  They knew the code to our garage door  so theyd come in with no warning or advance notice  Sometimes  theyd go into the backyard and look in the back patio door because we have no curtain or blinds on it  It would annoy my husband  but he was too respectful of them to say anything  and I always had the feeling that these are my parents and I should allow it  Now that I have my daughters  my mother continues to do and say things that clearly indicate she doesnt know her place  When I went over to my parents house one time for a family get together  my mother got mad that I went into another room to pump  She said   Why do you have to do that now  We have guests   Due to past history  I also have little reason to trust her   At six months old  she dropped my daughter on her head on a tile floor after she dismissed my concerns that she was not secure enough   For a while  she was adamant about wanting my daughter to sleep over  When my mother saw that I wasn’t comfortable with it  shed turn to my daughter and say   You want to sleep over grandmas  dont you   In the past year and a half  I feel like its gotten worse   In the fall  my father showed up outside my work and sat in his car  waiting to see if I showed up  I am a teacher  Do I need to mention the inappropriateness of a strange man sitting outside an elementary school without reason to be there  A month later  both he and my mother were sick  When I tried to get them both appointments to be vaccinated  my father got belligerent with me on the phone because  I didnt care about my family  and I didnt want to see them   By late spring  they were sick again  although we don’t know with what but they were laid out for  weeks  When they got better  it was almost Fathers Day and my mother tried to take over the day with no consideration for my husband  The last straw came a few weeks ago when she showed up at our door  again unannounced  no phone call  no advance notice  We were in the middle of eating breakfast  and we pretended we weren’t home   The following week  she brought it up on a video call in order to lay on the guilt trip  My husband and I both lost it  My mothers response was that she didnt feel like she should have to stand on ceremony  My father didnt even want to talk to us  She kept looking to the side  and I knew he was there but pretended like he wasnt  So now  my husband and I are fed up and wonder if its worth maintaining the relationship   Do they sound like narcissists   Theyve never been physically abusive  but the examples Ive cited make me wonder about where our relationship falls,3916,744

758,p6vb03,0,4,Manipulation Brainwashing MentalAbuse Hi everyone Im very happy that I found this sub It feels good to know  that Im not alone with my experiences I want to tell you my story  I have to  because Im falling apart at the moment  I was raised by narcissists  Not the kind of them  that beats their kids  My parents are manipulative geniuses  My father is the type of narcissist that only does things for himself  He is neither empathic nor understanding  He blamed me for everything since I am able to think  He was never there for me  Always promising stuff to me and when I was so happy to finally do stuff with my dad  he just shit on me and did other stuff that was more important for him than his only child The worst thing about it is  that he always made me believe  that hes the greatest and that I am the lazy  aggressive kid who never does what his father tells it to do He sucked out my self esteem  my confidence  everything  He insulted me  I never knew  when he would freak out next He punished me by taking the only thing  that really took me away from that horrible reality  My PC After an argument he stopped talking to me  he completely ignored me  And suddenly  after a few days  everything was like it was before I never understood  why he acted like that My Mom was the exact opposite  but also with extremely narcissistics traits  She loved blaming me when I did stupid shit  she was shittalking about me with her friends  she was always so shocked  when I did something  that didnt fit her imagination of the perfect child On the other hand  she still gave me a lot of love  Thats the only reason  I am still alive today My mom was traumatized by the death of her sister  who died from heroin abuse Her worst fear was that I get addicted to something  She always told me  that I already was addicted and how bad gaming is for me  She was so toxic when she had the feeling to be a bad mother They did blame me for almost everything  my dad bullied me  my mum overcared and put me under massive pressure  My IQ is  and she always expected that I will do all the stuff that she wants  She thought  she could improve my  genius  I hated it  I had to do so much stuff that I didnt want to do  I was forced to do it anyway  I was blamed when I didnt want to  They didnt care about my feelings  blamed me EXTREMELY for my anger  Laughed about me when I was scared about something  And the worst thing about it is here to come They are manipulative as fuck  They always showed themself as the good parents and gave me the feeling  I was a bad kid and a failure  They brainwashed me  And it worked Now  Im taking medication against my depression and anxiety daily  I developed a pot addiction and it feels like my parents are now in my head  constantly telling me that Im doing everything wrong and that Im not worth shit I was able to move out and since december  Im living alone  Im broken inside  My heart feels like it has shattered Im in therapy for  years now and I did a lot of progress  But theres still this incredible emptiness inside of me  Im so done of it I will move on  because I promised it to my grandma  But its so hard  Every day is so incredibly hard  Im struggling with eating and sleeping  My body feels horrible  My stomach hurts all the time  Its just to much too carry Maybe you guys can show me  how you are healing your inner wounds  I would appreciate so much Love to all of you  your worth is infinite ❤️❤️❤️,3514,640
759,p6v9zr,0,2,Chaos makes me feel safe One way I heal is by mediating and trying to find subconscious thoughts  While doing this I had an important realization of why I always need to be  on  or entertained or in some kind of adrenaline rush  And that is is my mom was very neglectful and not just emotionally  I guesse when I was young being left alone almost all the time I felt like i was abandoned and scared and like i was gonna die even  But then my parents would always fight and scream and be violent in the other room and hearing that chaotic presence made me feel safe bwcuse then I knew I wasnt abandoned and that was as close to feeling safe as I was gonna get in this household  All those danger or overstimulated feelings I got in my body when they were being violent and fighting each other I learned to associate with safety becuse they made no effort to actually make me feel safe  So I had to look for some version  of good feelings  in the bad painful feelings  Since hearing people screaming and knowing Im not abandoned is alittle better than being neglected and thinking Ive been abandoned    that was my postive feelings my only version of safety  So I gusse i seek out chaos or being overstimulated because that is what makes me feel safe that is what I thought safe was  That why I get boared so easily and always need to be on   just like most people want to feel safe almost all the time I need to be  on  almost all the time,1441,273

761,p6v1su,0,4,Almost there… I  f  am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel  My “mother” has been in assisted living since the end of June  My husband and I moved her to our state  years ago because she was declining and had discarded my siblings one too many times  she’s burned bridges and never had to pay the price for it  There was always someone there to clean up her debris  We thought she would be here  at most  a year  We found an apartment for her one mile from our home  Five years later  she’s finally off of my back and someone else responsibility  In the five years that she’s been here  I’ve had countless panic attacks and one mental breakdown  I’m currently in therapy  My husband had no idea what my childhood was like  I kept that hidden  I’m realizing that the shame I felt  that kept me silent all those years was theirs and never mine  until one day  years ago  she had a toxic meltdown on him  I was not there   and when he told me about it  something snapped in me  and I told him  over a period of months  what my childhood was like  He was horrified  He believed me from the start  Since that day  he has been my shield and a fantastic buffer from her  He took most of the responsibility for her care and helped me shoulder the rest  He is the reason that I am functional  Since she’s been in the facility  I feel like I can finally breathe  No more taking her to countless doctor appointment  no more cleaning her apartment  no more picking up her meds  no more keeping track of her meds  no more getting her groceries  no more calling her every night  no more listening to her complain  no more being told what I have to do for her  and most importantly  NO MORE HER  The only thing I will do is visit her once per week for an hour and only with my husband present  I’ve wanted my life back for the past five years  I’ve been in stasis for each of those years  I have not been free to live my own life  I have resented each moment that she’s been here  I have had to do things for her that were never done for me  I did not get taken to the doctor  yet I had to take her on a whim  She did laundry once a month  ask me if I had  pairs of underwear  I did not    yet she would make sure that I had her laundry done and done to her specifications  I had to take her to get her hair done   When I needed a haircut  I was told  “No  nobody’s looking you anyway “  I had to help her figure out her insurance  When I needed help with picking classes in high school  she told me not to bother her with that shit  I could list countless examples  but I know that you know  why else would you be here  For the first time in five years  my husband  son  and I were able to take a family vacation together  Since she’s been here  someone would always have to stay behind to look after her  Not any more  She is miserable in the facility  she makes sure to tell me as soon as I arrive  I have encouraged her to join in the MULTIPLE activities the facility provides  but she refuses  She would rather guilt me for her loneliness than take part in any social program to lighten her mood  She will choose misery until the day she dies  She must love it  She’s welcome to it  She can sit in her room and be miserable  That was acceptable to her for me while I lived in that house  at least I’ll check in on her once a week  I’m almost at the finish line  she will never leave the facility  I am no longer obligated to care for her in any way  my husband knows my past  and I’m in therapy  I’m not sure why I decided to post  maybe I’m feeling safer now that there is no way that she can reach me  When the phone rings  I don’t get a spike in my anxiety anymore  it will never be her on the other end tasking me with the latest Labor of Hercules  She is contained in the facility  and I am so relieved  She could have been a queen  she has  children   in laws   grandchildren  and  great grandchildren  If she had been any kind of a mother  we would all have been vying to see who could take her in   We are all good  kind people  She should be so proud of us all  Instead  she has discarded my siblings numerous times over the most petty garbage  And so she sits in her room at the facility alone and miserable  and I just feel relief,4255,841
762,p6uz9z,0,3,Struggling to come to terms So first time posting  I have been lurking on Reddit for awhile  I had a massive clash with my mother recently that has alot of fallout  I was explaining to a friend how my childhood was with my mother and he told me to come here and just read some of the posts and its been   rough  I feel like maybe my mother is a narcissist but I also feel like my childhood wasnt bad I have a very vivid memory of when I was   Im F now  and her screaming at me saying if I dont like how she does things to leave  Well I did  And she was pissed when I finally got back home  Other things were her waking me up at insane hours because I didnt do something her way  screaming at me for defending myself and saying I am just being combative  forcing me into confrontations that made me panic  on one occasion she told a person I had a crush on them while I was there and then getting upset when I didnt like that  There is just alot from my childhood that I thought was normal that wasnt apparently The most recent thing actually cost me a job  She and my dad are talking about splitting up  My dad thought he could fix things and my mom  without talking to him  has already been looking for new places and was talking to another guy  The guy ended up being one of those Nigeria catfishing scams  Since then  she has pulled out of allowing my husband to borrow a car since I needed my car for work and just dropped watching my kids  I ended up having to quit my job so my husband can get to work  his job pays better   We relied and trusted her and she just dumped us while we are trying to get back on our feet  I would go on about how she has treated my sister but thats a whole different rant  Long story short  my mom is homophobic towards my very gay sister  I hate it Im just struggling to understand what I did wrong for my mom to treat me like this  Even now as an adult I feel like I just disappoint her  Im hoping that posting this out here I can get some answers or maybe others who understand  Im not sure if my mom is a narcissist  I know I wasnt the best kid to raise but I cant help but relate to alot of what I have been reading here  What do I do with just processing this or even how to go forward with setting boundaries,2277,448

765,p6up33,0,7,Therapist validated my feelings about nmom Ive been a lurker on and off for the past few years but Ive finally had some progress with my nmom and wanted to share  This subreddit really helped me recognize my moms actions for what they were even though I did second guess and doubt what I was feeling  It feels amazing to have something that has been a weight on me for years at this point lifted  even if its just a little bit and Im still working through this As background I joined this subreddit on a different account about  years ago and eventually convinced myself that my moms behavior wasnt that bad despite the fact that a lot of it still affects how I feel about myself   years  after moving out her house and going pretty low contact with her  I still feel comfortable with the boundary of talking to her occasionally  I have nephew that lives in her house that I still want to support  She has a history of commenting negatively on my appearance unprovoked  a lack of boundaries  outright screaming  parentification  treating us as adults rather than children  and prioritizing herself over the needs of me and my sister  i e  Needing a computer for school and buying herself a new TV instead  redecorating the house instead of paying my tuition in high school and college  Shes recently gained the habit of calling me pretty consistently  When I dont answer for a couple of her calls  shell start with   Ive been calling you  Why dont you answer me  You need to tell me things    before even saying hello and its been putting me in a bad place  Im a person in my mid twenties with a full time job  a new house  and friendships that Im trying to maintain  Im just busy and dont have the time to pretend that I like my mom Needless to say  weve never had an amazing relationship so  it was weird to me that she wanted to be my friend all of sudden despite the fact that shes used the line Im not your friend multiple times with me  I decided to bring it up with a therapist Ive been seeing recently  After talking through it with she said   Have you ever looked up narcissim in mothers    Holy shit   I had never mentioned me being in this subreddit before and after talking about my mom for a single session she came up with this At this point  I had everything validated and gathered the courage to tell my mom that I was officially putting up a low contact boundary the next time she called  Her response really showed me that she doesnt even think of her behavior as borderline abusive which is discouraging and makes me feel like Ill never really get closure for how my childhood played out but I guess thats a journey to work through in the future,2706,482

767,p6ulij,0,10,We need to start holding the Enablers accountable Ive seen a lot of posts on this sub that will mention how their Enabler Parent was their rock  kept the abuse from getting worse or use their relationship with their EParent as rationale for why they cant go LC or NC with their Narc Parent  While I understand trauma bonding and why with parents  you cling to one if the other is abusive  but I really dont think people  in general  are holding Enablers accountable for their part is narcissistic abuse Once I was well into mental health treatment and had actually confronted the abuse I received from my NMom  thats when my therapist started talking about my Dad more and more  Where was he when these things happened  How did he react when I went to him about what my mom was doing  Did he ever challenge my mom whenever she was hurling emotional abuse at her children  How did he handle the situation when my mother was still active in her alcoholism In the beginning of when we were examining my fathers role in all of this  I defended him a lot  Saying I was a Daddys girl and that he kept her behavior in check  But as I really began to look at the whole picture  it really clicked with me with what the word  enabler  really means  That my NMom was empowered in her abuse of her children and her alcoholism because she had a partner that enabled her behavior  A partner who picked up her slack where she failed as a parent  but never helped his children cope with her behavior and left those kids in that situation  How my EDad spent all of his energy  taking care  of my mother in a way that allowed her alcoholism to thrive and prevented her from having to deal with the consequences of her actions  He infantilized her  helped keep her sick in her alcoholism  and he failed us when it came to her behavior We are as a culture becoming more and more aware of narcissism and narcissistic abuse  we are seeing terms like gaslighting  grey rocking and setting boundaries more and more all over the place  But I dont see anyone  other than our patron saint  Dr  Ramani  really talking about enabling and its role in emotional abuse  And working through that dynamic  especially when it involves trauma bonding  is painful  but I believe crucial part of healing the damage caused by narc abuse  Your enabler parent may have been in the trenches with you as the bombs were falling  but they  at minimum  left you both there in the mud and at worst kept you from climbing out,2494,450
768,p6uedn,0,122,You’re too young to know if your leg is broken   When I was   I broke my ankle when I fell about six feet into someone’s back yard  Broke both the tibia and fibula  and my friends took me to the ER  When my mother got to the hospital  I was sitting in a wheelchair with my feet on the footrests  in great pain  and putting no weight in my foot just touching it to the footrest so it wouldn’t move and hurt more  She started yelling at me that I was too young to possibly know that I broke anything  and that I should have had her check it first before going to the hospital  I literally could not walk or put any weight on it whatsoever  and instead of arguing with her about it  I simply lifted my knee up  and my foot swung down at an awkward ankle that is not possible if there is bone attaching the foot to the leg  She blanched  and said  “Oh ” And even now    years later  and knowing her narcissistic idiocy and medical neglect  that was the MOST SATISFYING moment  🤣,978,191
769,p6uba1,0,6,Apparently when I give my parents the bare minimum  food shelter  its not enough for them     but I had to worship them for it My dad always tried to take my money before I even had a job  When I was in school like college he would say almost every visit  when you get a job and start making money you are gonna give it all to me right   Not some  not buy me nice things    no like hand my paychecks over to him  I said no and he tried again when I got a job  I told him    the only way you are getting my money is to help pay for nesscities like bills  and groceries and other bare minimum stuff  You are never getting a penny for extra luxuries and I will pay the Bills myself as I dont trust you with my money  My parents didnt like that     that I was only willing to give them food and shelter and other bare minimum stuff     but when they gave me that I was supoose to be so grateful and worship them  Huh  So they are entitled to luxuiorus  life but I only get the bare minimum and get that held over my head    They cant tolerate their own behaviour    when you reflect themselves back to them they domt like it  they get to live by different rules apparently,1171,226
770,p6u7ci,0,28,I  have to apologize to my father or else  I  am the one creating the rift in our relationship     Warning  COVID  Anti vax   Oof this got a lot longer than I anticipated  TL DR at the bottom I dont even know where to start this post  Im so hilariously upset  Background  My father is very much a  Trump is the best  kind of Republican  Throughout the whole pandemic so far  my father has been staunchly in the  Covid is just the flu  The democrats are making it up  The CDC is a sham  Camp  He refuses to get vaccinated  Early on  I tried my best to get him to understand the ramifications of those views  but was met with anger  defensiveness  and dismissiveness  Whats worse is that he works in a Customer Facing field  remaining vague for privacy reasons   so even if hes actually wearing his mask and using sanitizer  theres still a significant risk he could be infected  And then bring that infection home to my mother So I gave up  I stopped talking to him about it  and I tried very hard to set down the emotional burden of caring about him making stupid  selfish choices about himself and everyone around him  Four days ago  my sister tells me that my parents both have COVID  and my father had COVID when he visited my apartment the prior week  while symptomatic  also I know this is my fault for not just refusing to see him without him being vaxd  but Im so beat down at this point   Note  they never contacted me  and still havent  I had to hear about all of this through my sister Naturally  I freak out and immediately rush out to try to get a rapid test to make sure I dont have it and to make sure that I havent accidently spread it to other people   Thankfully  Im negative   This whole time  Im just so incredibly angry  this could have been prevented  mostly  probably  if he had been vaccinated  He endangered himself  my mother  who is vaccinated  thankfully   my sister  and I  also all vaxd   So I didnt call  because at this point  I dont care  Like sure  I hope he survives because deep down I do care about him  and I hope he doesnt have to go to the hospital  but I literally cant have any sympathy for him at this point  He made his bed and now hes lying in it  in my head  he almost deserves this  My mother is fine  She had symptoms for like  days and its basically back to normal now  WOW Vaccines work   Who would have thought     s  But my father is still doing poorly  Not hospital worthy  but definitely isnt having a good time and has been consistently bad for   days now Cut to yesterday where my mother calls me and spends an hour berating me on the phone because  Im selfish and self centered for rushing out to get tested and not calling to see how my father is doing   Apparently my father  feels so disrespected that I havent called   She even tried to start off the conversation with  I want to hear your side of things  but she definitely did not care because it went in one ear and out the other  because my fathers feelings about the situation are the only valid ones  She even had the gall to say  essentially  I cant really remember exactly what she said  at this point in the call I was on the edge of a breakdown   I dont know why youre acting like this  its not like we abused you   Because apparently what shes doing isnt abuse and I should be just happy that she doesnt and hadnt hit me Apparently I have to call today and apologize to him for not calling and checking on him  Otherwise  Im  the one creating the rift in our relationship that will never be fixed  Because Im so self centered I feel like this is just so incredibly entitled   But I also cant really tell because I feel almost gaslit into this being my fault  Sorry for the incredibly long post  Ultimately Im going to  apologize  to keep the peace for another year until I can move and put   miles between them and me  But its just so frustrating If you made it this far  thank you for taking the time to read it  TL DR   Anti vax father got COVID and now wants me to baby him because he feels super bad  and because I didnt  Im the selfish self centered one and I have to apologize,4180,754
771,p6u4ln,0,4,Imposter syndrome caused by narcissistic parenting Does anyone else get this Sometimes I feel like I don’t belong in groups or I suddenly start feeling things like “I shouldn’t be here  I don’t fit with these people”  when I actually do It’s difficult to explain  but it’s like an imposter syndrome caused by a lack of confidence  an “expectation” of rejection by others linked to a social anxiety because of an avoidant attachment style  and also probably internalising narc criticism which has made me feel like I don’t deserve my achievements and that any time something has gone well in my life it has been a “fluke”  and not a result of genuine hard work or something I deserve  I suppose it can be traced back to a poor and inaccurate self image  but I am worried it’s really impacting my ability to make genuine connections with other people Of course  like all victims of a narc  I also crave that feeling of belonging to a group  but it seems to get spoilt or overridden by a fear of rejection,1011,175
772,p6u0cx,0,16,Getting called a “whore with ugly  oversized legs” by my mom as I leave my house I was wearing shorts and my mom told me to change  I said no because I was in a rush  To which she responds by calling me a “whore with ugly  oversized legs ” And then she goes on saying “How can you wear that  you’re not even skinny  You look like a pig  I would be embarrassed ”Mind you  this is the first thing she said to me that day  All I did was walk downstairs and say bye to her since I was going out  I already hate the way I look and am super self conscious since I gained a lot of weight recently from my psychiatric medication  When I hear her say these things  I can’t help but hate the way I look even more and hate myself even more  I know I shouldn’t take it to heart  But it’s so hard not to let her words affect me  It’s like hearing the negative voice in my head become materialized into her  And I automatically start to hate myself even more  even when I think i don’t let it affect me,996,199
773,p6ty40,0,2,I have some questions about my mom    So Ive never posted here  please excuse me if this is extremely long and all over the place My nmom was both sides of the same coin  By all accounts  she was a great mom  and she really was  she paid for after school activities for years  most of the presents I wanted  nice clothes and shoes   but it was all for show  She made sure that I looked like my mom treated me well  but the emotional abuse was  chefs kiss  abundant  The insults  the gaslighting  the manipulation  the guilt trips  all of it  But out of her four kids and my stepdad  I was the oldest and her main focus  The cycle was so bad that when I got a detention and my principal asked her if everything was going well at home  that my mom took my phone for  months  THEN I had after school practice  from pm pm   obviously couldnt call her to pick me up  and a teacher saw me and waited with me until pm  until she decided to come get me  Then I got in more trouble because I made her look like a bad mom  yet again   I couldnt use the teachers phone because I didnt remember my moms phone number at the time  Anyway  thats just an example of her specific cycle  She controlled who i talked to  what I did  where I went  all of my money  when she let me have a job  and even what car I got  When I made a mistake  she drilled into me that my physical appearance was subpar  Im a failure  Ill never succeed  etc  then theres a huge overexaggerated punishment  Rinse  repeat  The last time came when I got a C in a college course while still living at home  age    She told me Im a failure  I would never be successful blah blah blah  and manipulated me into joining the military  But thats where I found therapy  for my nmom and other issues   I got out and have been LC with her since Has anyone else experienced anything similar  A lot of the stories I read on here seem much more extreme  like abuse and control to the point where NC is the only option  Lately  with the pandemic I havent been going to therapy  and Im starting to question things  For example   my mom was great  and went out of her way to get me things that I wanted  why am I feeling all this resentment    Maybe Im only remembering the good times  Maybe it wasnt that bad  But then I turn around and immediately compare her to Rapunzels  mother   who sheltered her physically  who controlled what she did  who manipulated and gaslighted her  and made her feel guilty for things that werent her fault  I know this is really long  but over explaining is something that Im unfortunately very good at Being on this sub has shown me similar experiences Ive had to most of you  but please let me know if anyone has similar experiences to anything up there ☝️  I feel like Im losing it  Am I literally gaslighting myself  Lol,2833,528

778,p6teuk,0,8,My friend’s abusive parents have been stalking them non stop and I need help keeping them safe  Cross post from r rbnlegaladvice Okay  so this may be a bit long  but I’m going to try summing or up as much as possible  The folks at r legaladvice were very disrespectful and don’t quite understand narcissistic abuse  so I had to go elsewhere for any type of constructive help   Backstory     TW  Abuse  As the title states  my friends abusive parents have been trying to track them down and make them return home ever since they ran away a few months  maybe even a year or two  ago  Mind you  this is a grown person we’re talking about  they’re  going on   The parents have been using the excuse that the child is sick and needs to be at home so they can take care of them  The child is fine  only suffering from mental trauma from all of the emotional abuse  The police in the state that the parents reside have stopped helping them  as they say the parents have been wasting their time filing reports on a child who clearly isn’t missing  just done with their BS  so they came to the state in which my friend ran to  and have gotten the police involved here We live in a safe house for runaway youth  and the parents found out their kid was living here  By rule were not allowed to tell parents that their kid is here  but they brought the police with them so we had to comply with a “wellness check ” The parents then proceeded to go around to some of the stores my friend and I frequent giving out their card and telling them to contact their number the next time the kid comes in the store  My friend is currently in the hospital due to ptsd  and because the police were involved  the parents were able to find out they were there and showed up at the hospital  Now my friend is terrified of being discharged out of fear that they’re waiting outside for them   What we’re doing   We’re currently looking for legal action to be taken against the parents  but a Civil Protective Order and Anti Stalking Order both require my friend to show up in court  which they say will be too traumatic for them and they’re not sure if they want to go through with They are  however  planning to go in person to the police department and asking them to stop helping the parents because they are indeed not missing  and they are just running away from their abuse We’ve been looking for ways to possibly get the parents arrested make them lose their jobs  but the only thing we found is that the parents can get jail time for making false reports and wasting the police’s time  We don’t know the specifics  but this seems like our only solid option right about now  My friend does have some evidence of the abuse  but not the most extreme of it  and the legal system kinda sucks when it comes to emotional abuse anyways  so we’re not sure if that would be enough  I guess what I’m here to ask is  what can we do other than a protective order to make sure some legal repercussions are taken against the parents  Have any of you taken legal action against your n’parents  What did you do  and what was the outcome  How can we permanently stop the parents from being able to harass my friend like this  constantly tracking them down  lying about them being mentally unable to take care of themself  etc  Also  my friend wants to know if there’s a way they can get their missing persons report removed from the internet  I haven’t found a way to do that  but they’re very unsettled by the fact that it’s there  and they want it gone I apologize for such a long post  but I do thank you all so much in advance for any help you could offer at all  I greatly appreciate it,3684,669

783,p6srop,0,5,My mother has ruined just about every aspect of my life and I dont know what to do about it I    have played a sport for  years now  and during the past  years of that sport Ive gotten really good and made a national team  Practice is my escape  and I really did enjoy the sport for most of the time Ive played  Last season  my stats were out of this world  I was among the best performers  if not  the best  on my team  And I really worked for it  I spent up to six hours working out every day during quarantine and it really showed up in my game  But during that time  Id been staying with relatives  and once I moved back home  everything took a turn for the worst  Just for context  I slept on the couch at my house  and so did she because we lived with relatives  She refused to get us our own apartment because it was a  waste of money   And eventually  I realized no matter how much I tried to get through to my mom  she would not care  But I refused to stop trying  And thats when it came back to bite me in the butt  This past summer season  my performance on my team has improved immensely defensively  but while I used to be among the best offensive players  I dropped to sitting the bench during big games  My mom saw this and grew extremely angry about it  and in an emotional outburst told my coach I was no longer doing workouts at home and I had stop putting in the effort to improve my performance  She then went on to make an insane contract that I had to complete within about two and a half weeks of I wanted to stay on the team  Write an essay about accountability  write about three people in leadership  start a gratitude journal  and the most absurd request of all  lose  pounds in two weeks  This contract sent me into a complete spiral and while I was en route to get recruited for college sports  I was seriously considering just quitting  Somehow I got lucky and before the two weeks ended my mom told me both her best friend and boyfriend basically went  what the hell are you doing   when she told them about it  And though she apologized to me  I do feel it was because they told her it was wrong and not because she cared about how I felt  The week prior wed gotten into an argument and she said  I dont care about your struggles  get over them  This past week  I attempted to set things right with my coach  who although I was one of his best performers until my mental health decline  said he completely agreed with my mom and was trying to convince me to leave the team  Though I was able to convince him to let me keep my spot  if I dont perform well this fall  Im kicked off definitively  And during the entire conversation I tried to tell him my mom didnt tell him the full truth  and that I even had VIDEO PROOF of all my workouts  which my grandpa would take me to bcs my mom always had work   he didnt believe me  Straight up told me  If youre putting the effort in  why did your mom tell me otherwise   And he insisted I was only upset because now I was about to lose my spot on the team  And thats when I realized my mom has completely ruined this for me  My reputation with my coach is completely ruined  My mom said its either I play with this team or quit  and I do not see myself continuing with them past this fall  We just got a house finally  and now live two hours away one way from them  It would make more sense to find a new team  but its not even a choice I have  and I feel the environment on this team isnt healthy for me to be in anymore  I still want to play in college  but what do I do  Should I convince my mom to let me play for another team  I feel very lost in the situation  but I dont think I should give up just yet,3721,729

797,p6r4ug,0,5,Seeking advice here and on another thread    Dialogue welcome I am a F in a developed Western country  Ive lived here for the past  years of my life  having emigrated from a poorer part of Europe  For a while  I thought I was doing quite well in terms of  living  and  adulting    handled and completed higher degrees  found jobs  got through several moves across and between countries  handled getting married and divorced and still done kinda okay  For a while now  at least a couple of years  I havent felt like I am doing too great     I thought that by setting goals to advance beyond my starting baseline would help me feel better about myself  feel pride in my achievements and make life feel like its worth living  But I havent felt that in ages  If anything  most aspects of my life look horrid from where I am standing and even though I have advanced from my starting baseline  I am still pretty much     losing at the game called life I once had a passion   my work and education  Ive lost that about  years after I got my PhD in a field I was truly passionate about  I am lucky to have had a job ever since I finished my PhD  but now the energy that kept me going in face of academic and office politics  energy which stemmed from curiosity and desire to find out new things and also teach people  has dissappeared  If anything I think its all a sham and even within this  masquarade  I am not good  intelligent  knowleadgeable enough  nor do i feel like I have a voice  I do not feel like I can make good service to the values that once drove my energy for my work and I no longer believe in it   Also I do not have great relationships with my co workers  I always thought that by being nice and smiling  saying good things to people  would win me kudos  But actually  perhaps I just come across as aloof and strange to my colleagus in each of my jobs that Ive held in the past  years  many  many short term contracts    I have no idea if people generally dislike me  feel indifferent to me etc    the only advice I keep getting is that I shouldnt care but    I also cannot live in a bubble not knowing whether I offend people or push them away unwillingly  And maybe I dont but I still fail terribly at making any meaningful connections I thought that by diversifiying my social networks Id feel more enriched by peoples stories  experiences and would provide both a source of potential friendships and new  diverse activities  But after multiple tries  I gave up searching and trying    I only have my partners friends to rely on  which I do regard as primarily his    I havent kept proper contact with my old friends  due to having to focus a lot on work for me to still have a job  when I still believed in it   and I dont think they actually ever liked me or were ever more than indifferent to my existence  I tried rekindling old relationships frequently  but   I only speak to people if I initiate    And then I get forgotten   Also  so much time has passed that Ive lost touch with peoples lifes and them with mine  So interactions are simply polite and out of politeness  when anyone has a bit of a free pocket of time to fill it  i e  I would not have the courage to ask any of my friends to actively help with a house move or anything too onerous because that sort of closeness has never been there and it is less so nowadays   I cherish the times I do see them  but they are very few and I do tend to not be great at having a voice during get togethers  My family life is not great either  I take comfort and I am grateful for my fiances family for accepting me  I have  family members close by   my mother doesnt really like me and I have felt rather comfortable on the Nparents threads on reddit  I am still trying to please her to feel accepted and despite that plus LC  things are not getting better so I am working actively on helping myself accept the bad situation for what it is  I also try to continuously see her point of view so that if I am criticised or yelled at  I feel better equipped to forgive those situations  My only other family member who I cherish highly is understandibly too busy with their own family and worries  hence too tired for connection  I havent seen this person in at least months and last time we spoke on a videochat was around March  Again  just like with the friends situation   we kinda lost touch with each others lifes  And frankly  I think they are too tired  busy and have enough of their own stuff to deal with than to listed to me whine I havent enjoyed many things in many months  but I am constantly trying to  do better  and drag myself towards some goal  I continue to take medication for anx and depression  I have  therapists  one for past trauma and one for potential  self diagnosed ASD   Drink alcohol socially once  max twice a week  without going overboard  given it could screw up my mood even more    I have put on a lot of weight so I am trying to calorie count and get myself back into an exercise routine  But it all feels bleak  Ill do it  expend my entire energy spoons for a day and then just want to go to bed at  and be on my own  If I could just not have to get out of bed at all and speak to no one at all that would be great    but also sad  I am a bit lucky that I am currently on holiday   so waking up later than   and trying to  allow myself   give myself permission to hide under the duvet in bed is okay  But once  go back to work   I wonder if i will still have any spoons for the new exercise routine and calorie count Where is my energy and will to  live   My motivation for anything at all  I know I should be doing a host of things   but I dont want to   too difficult  and for what  As I wont feel happy about any of these efforts anyway and reaching goals wont make me happier  as my history has taught me And I feel ashamed of it all  What a spiral of  meh  I feel lucky to have a partner who loves and cherishes me and who still wants to marry me  It feels like the sole comfort I currently have in what seems otherwise like a void life  I cannot really see a happy or at least content future  with my having kids  a nice house etc  I feel like these outcomes are highly unlikely  I hate the thought that the way I feel right now might drive him away too  which would leave me utterly alone  as I have been before  And I would lose even the last good thing that is going for me    But I am almost willing to accept that too  Id rather he were happy than miserable like myself Sorry for the long post  but I am not sure tbh what my problem is or even where to start to make it better  But I do want to do better   surely  not everyone feels like this  Where to I start  Does anyone have any good advice for me  In short  All aspects of my life feel bleak and void despite efforts  I dont know why my life feels so broken and I dont know how to fix the parts that are indeed broken  I have  good thing going for me and I fear that my current mood  low energy and lack of motivation will drive this  good thing away also  In dire need of advice  Or maybe its me having stupid first world problems,7171,1371

800,p6q211,0,5,My mom discourages me to go to a college This is a brief story of my high school days   I have a older sister  When she was in high school  she was also discouraged to go to an university because  as my mom had said  universities are expensive  However  she went anyway  while she worked part time so hard to make money for a living and tuition   And when I was in high school  I also thought that I wanted to go to an university because without a degree its more difficult to get a job or does help somehow when youd change your career  But my mom used guilt trip to tell me indirectly  in a manipulative way  not to  i e   If you went to a college  Id have a hard time again as I did when your sister did that  How on earth could parents discourage their children about education  while that is the responsibility for them  She always put herself emotionally and physically before anyone  And she always told me your dad is a damn guy  even though he is an engineer  My dad stayed in silence all the time cuz he knew whatever statement he made wouldnt work for my mom  since she always scream and shout to stop anyone in my family from speaking  when shes at a disadvantage  And now Im unemployed  facing and being under pressure from society that says unless youve got a degree youd be not even on a resume scanning Parents are evil and society treat them like  You did a good job  You gave a birth and made a contribution to society  When they grow up  youd done with your job   How could they behave like that  Who allowed her to be a parent of human beings,1580,299
801,p6pvk9,0,4,Seeing my dad soon for the first time since before the pandemic On mobile  first time posting  advice warmly welcomed Background  I  F  live in a different country to my dad  M   parents are divorced  mom is aware of the situation  lives in another country still  I prefer to keep her an uninvolved as possible I will be visiting my home country  where my dad lives  in November for the first time since   I am really struggling to decide how I want to approach interactions with my dad We’ve always had a tumultuous relationship  with main issues being him acting as a friend rather than parent  or on the flip side getting very aggressive when I wouldn’t show him ‘the respect he had to show his father’  You get the gist However  since I moved out and began working through my childhood issues  and establishing boundaries around them  things have significantly worsened  Whenever I try to enforce a boundary  I get barraged with aggressive messages about how ‘I’m just waiting for an excuse to cut him out’ and ‘he always knew it would come to this’  About a year ago I actually did cut contact for a while after a particularly nasty incident  Whenever things calm down  he becomes perfectly agreeable  checks in often  and is an exemplary parent  It doesn’t help that he’s prone to manic episodes  during which he sends me money out of nowhere   making me feel all the more guilty about debating cutting him out It is not possible for me to avoid seeing him during my trip without making it VERY obvious and hurtful that that’s what’s happening  So I’m stuck between two options  pretend things are fine and try to withstand the abuse and negging for a few days  or set boundaries ahead of time and risk armageddon before I even get there Worth noting  greyrocking does not work on my dad   or I’m doing it wrong  He does this ‘nipping’ thing where he’ll start with offhanded comments  and if he doesn’t get the desired reaction he keeps going and escalates until he does  We went from “you shouldn’t use Tinder’ to “well if THAT’S your definition then I’ve also SA’d people ” in one phonecall like that once,2134,371
802,p6pvag,0,9,F  I’m afraid to have kids because of how I was raised by my NMom   CW  mentions of bodily harm  Hi all  I’ll try to keep this relatively concise  The gist is I got engaged in March  just before all the lockdowns went into place in the US  My fiancé is a very sweet and loving man and we get along great  even though the past year has been really tough on both of us emotionally and mentally He wants to have kids despite having a similar relationship with his mom as I do  I have met his mom multiple times and she was definitely in a mostly loveless marriage with his father and appeared to latch onto my fiancé for companionship  like some parents do  though it’s inappropriate to rely on your kids like that  He set the record straight with her and they appear to be somewhat better now  But I can’t say the same thing for my mom  She has no filter and basically assumes she can get her way with pretty much everything  regardless of who she hurts in the process  She actually “thanked” my fiancé for going out with me on a Zoom call  like I’m some kind of freak  when we didn’t attend Thanksgiving  at her house due to COVID though she still had my brother and his wife over  My brother later got COVID from that incident but has since recovered My mom has been extremely critical  controlling and borderline bullying for my entire life since I was growing up and constantly trying to meddle in my love life with unsolicited advice  I know she does this because she is a profoundly insecure person who hated her dad growing up for choosing work over his family but she lacks the self awareness to not use her children like therapists or recognize how her actions alienate people  She at one point told two strangers waiting for a plane at the airport that she hates my tattoos and “wishes she could cut them off and replace them with skin grafts” because she finds them trashy  Two random strangers  waiting for a plane  I was  at the time  And she thinks that makes her more relatable I’m not against having kids  even though I do like the way things are now with him  but my previous experiences with her left such a traumatic impact on me that I doubt I have the emotional and mental health resiliency to not go down the same path that she did  I’ve had major depression bouts since I was   insomnia  eating disorders  weight issues  self worth issues and been in  abusive relationships with narcissistic men  I held off on dating for  years and got therapy to try to get over my resentment and anger  Now she is trying to interfere with my wedding planning despite the boundaries I’ve put into place  If she keeps it up  I won’t invite her there period  The general question I have is  are there any other people on here who weren’t sure about having kids based on how you were raised  Did you end up having them or not and how did it affect your life going forward I’m at an emotional rut because I don’t want to lose him as I love him so but I feel paralyzed by what to do,3012,559

804,p6pmob,0,14,My therapist labeled my parents actions as abuse and holy hell I couldnt stop crying  I had to nuke all of my posts because    saw some on other social media and   i love having a vent account and this sub  but it felt like a dead weight suffocating me If you remember me  I posted about my JnDad aka the Narcissus  ManChild  and somewhat of a JNoNmom  with a sprinkle of Grandma the Grinch who steals our Christmas presents and knows someones family relations better than her own I started therapy  months ago  about a weekly   hour session  thankfully its free due to me being a student  I cried for   of my sessions  Straight up went back down the memories  started talking and choking up  It felt so weird  therapist sat across silently and watched without saying anything  but  they were there   I felt their presence  I felt like Im being listened to  I also felt like Im suffocating her  I couldnt and didnt want to get down to all types of  incidents  we had at home  Halfway through my current sessions    she asks  the question   How often did it get physical  And I let it all rip  all incidents I could remember   years backwards I didnt cry  It was normalcy for me   i know it isnt normal  but its something Im used to  Therapist sat with eyes full of tears  Then proceeded to tell me theres a lump in their throat and they needed a moment  Didnt really cry but I could tell in their eyes they were about to  Minus that  there was a few times when she referred to my nparents name calling and yelling as abuse  Verbal abuse  I knew it was just that  Its just no ones ever outright said it  I feel both lighter and calmer with someone validating my experiences and acknowledging them  But also I feel like a liar  if I were to mention to my parents that theyve been verbally abused Id be gaslit into thinking I deserved it or that it never happened Its a lot to take in  Especially since therapy goes so deep down  I get physically and mentally exhausted  Post therapy moments are kinda awkward because I just spilled my guts out about feeling unwanted and my treatment  and then Im discussing weather and exams with the therapist  But I have a feeling Ill be okay in the end  My narcs dont know I go to therapy  nor will they  For various reasons  Therapist also knows I vent anonymously on reddit and about this sub  but also is aware my parents dont have diagnosis of any sort  They arent referred to as narcs by either therapist or me  But just my thoughts and their actions being acknowledged as hurtful and damaging to me  thats whats important for me,2616,474
805,p6pfv3,0,3,That time my friend shamed me So its just a random past memory  I was  at that time my controlling father never let me play outside as a kid saying that neighborhood kids were Cheapsters and they had bad upbringing I as a kid believed it and never went outside much  Just stayed at home in my teens I developed severe social anxiety when I had to go out by my own  I would start having a panic attack every time I had to talk to someone  My father constantly shamed for being a weirdo and not being independent enough although it was because of the way I was raised but I did make efforts to act normal  I was somewhat successful in that  One time my friend at the time said she had to withdraw money from the ATM so I just said even I want to learn that she started laughing at me I told her its because my father never lets me use any other form of payment other than cash and he keeps record of my bank transactions so I couldnt learn it  I know to anyone it may sound so weird and laughable but I was so hurt  I felt like a weirdo who knows nothing  Although after that I had to literally fight with my father to allow me to use my card and I learned everything but it still feels so bad  At  I still feel I lack so much behind others of my age I am still learning but I constantly feel that I can not relate to anyone  I want to move out soon but I am just too scared that I am too stupid for that I can not survive without my family,1447,295

809,p6p396,0,23,My NMom has conditioned my adopted cat to think she’s her mom instead of me  Now my cat is her cat  I adopted my cat April   My childhood dog  who was like a daughter to me  super attached to me  was put down in October   First of all  for needed context   my mother would overfeed my dog her medication  in hopes of “curing” her or treating her better  She confessed this to me in tears after my dog died  She worried it contributed to her needing to be put down  She hid my dog’s medicine from me when i wanted to do research to see what natural ways I can help alleviate her pain  like CBD oil etc   Just to help in any way  She vehemently denied me even knowing what the medicine was called  Furthermore  when my dog was literally dying after injection  she weakly turned her head towards me  and my mother forced her head to turn towards her instead  saying “look at  me   my baby”… as if she didn’t let my dog go RAIL THIN when I away for a month  So my mother was the last thing my dog saw  Not both of us  or even me  Just my mom  I was a complete mess after that  And I still don’t forgive my mom for what she did For a few months  I couldn’t stand sleeping alone without my dog  I was the only one in my house who slept alone  My parents had each other  my sister had her chihuahua  I had nothing but an empty bedside where my dog would sleep every single night  So I decided to adopt a different species  since I didn’t want to feel like I was replacing my dog  and I just wanted a new baby to care for and cuddle with at night So I got my cat  and named her Astra  My mom would curse and yell about “getting rid of that cat” when she was too shy to come out from under my bed the first few months  My mom gave up on her so easily  It was emotionally hard for me  but I didn’t  After my cat finally came out  amp  started warming up to me familiarizing herself  my mom forced my cat out of my room and into hers  saying she wasn’t allowed in my room  I made my cat a custom litterbox that looks like a pot of flowers  I bought her litter  the best cat food  etc  Yet she was close to my mom  And still is  more so  Because she’s been conditioned to be by her side  not me  And I still sleep alone  And I’m angry  I’m so angry  I’ve confronted my mom about this one time  and just as expected  she denies it with yelling and cursing  then asks “what’s wrong with you”  etc  My mom has even told me to stop feeding my cat  because it’s her job now  My heart is beyond the realm of broken  I miss my dog  And Astra was supposed to be my new baby  Yet now she treats me almost like a stranger  and meows when my mom is gone  sitting outside her room  It hurts  A lot  She won’t come into my room  or stay very long  It’s not familiar anymore I have given up  No matter what I’m her legal owner and she’s still my baby  but emotionally it doesn’t feel like it  And I think when I move out I will leave her with my mom  It’s just that Astra was my special name for her… it means “from the stars ” When I adopted her at a rescue site  her name was Naleli… which means star  I thought that was an insane coincidence  that it was meant to be  Hell  when I looked at her documents  she was literally rescued on my BIRTHDAY two years prior  at just  month old  I guess I was wrong  I’m just sad My mom has ruined so much for me in my life  She has shit in my dreams  stolen money from me  called me a whore at  just because I developed early  made me feel utterly worthless  My list makes a cvs receipt look like a post it  But all of that pales in comparison to this  I’m upset  I’m just really upset… thats all,3640,721

818,p6o7ha,0,5,Narc mum keeps pulling the classic  You know Im right  My mums annoyed at me for getting a job  Yeah  you read that right  She has accused me of leaving my son out and not thinking about my partner  saying my partner works harder than me and that I should really be a stay home mum Because she has never worked in her life and managed to flout the benefits welfare system  she has this very distorted view on what family life is  and just life in general tbh  She doesnt realise that every family is different and that not everyone is able to cheat the system and live off benefits  Theres lots of families with both parents working  but where she has no friends or family  she doesnt know how the real world works and that its very much normal  Shes a very sheltered person  I feel kinda sorry for her in a weird way She has been trying to pit my partner against me  telling him  I dont like what shes doing to you and your son   going on like she knows our lives and agreements  sucking up to him and saying he works really hard etc   She has managed to twist things and made out Im the bad person for getting upset at her for making a nasty comment about me working the other day  My partner is now mad at ME  accusing me of causing him stress and being dramatic about the entire situation  I called her this morning to try and talk and explain things  She literally starts off saying  You know Im right  and when I tried to explain that if she was concerned about my partner and our working lives  she couldve just spoke to him instead of making an embarrassment of herself and making me upset and angry  SHE had the audacity to start crying over the phone and cut the call  For reference  she posted the vile comment on a Facebook photo I posted of me working at a community day thing  I had people reply  message me and what not saying she was bang out of order and asking if i was ok and were extremely shocked to see that it was my mum who made the horrific comment  Shes done this before to my cousins  made vile comments about their parenting and own lives  thinking she knows best and what not  This is why she has no one  Not even her brother and sisters want anything to do with her  because she thinks shes superior but deep down  shes really really insecure so she projects it onto others  especially if they are happy or have some sort of success good news She always thinks shes right  She assumes when people get upset or angry its because they acknowledge that shes right  when reality is  people get annoyed with her because her behaviour is totally immature and unnecessary  She has pushed almost everyone away because of her constant  Im always right  attitude  She doesnt get invited to family meals or coffee meets or a trip to the pub  When my uncle died  who was married to my mums sister   the first thing my aunt did was call me and came round because she wanted support but knew she wouldnt get any from my mum  My mum never had friends and growing up we had to constantly keep moving because she kept causing trouble with the neighbours  Yet she doesnt see herself as the problem  but everyone else  Shell never realise it In her eyes shell always be right  Yet  shes a very bitter  entitled  lonely person whos hitting her fifties and has never had any kind of success  I know it makes her insecure  seeing family around her being successful  having friends  jobs  getting married and engaged  getting mortgages etc  She tries and hide her insecurities by lashing out at others for literally no reason  I honestly dont know how she can look at herself and think what shes doing is perfectly normal  Its not normal to always think youre right  criticise others yet get upset when people do the same to you and think the world revolves around you  Im kinda rambling now at this point  I just wanted to get shit off my chest Has anyone had any similar experiences  I know I have all the love and support in the world  but shit still hurts because my parents just cannot ever be proud of me,4073,740

822,p6nv6i,0,21,Being the Golden Child isn’t better than the Scapegoat  Here’s why Have you ben led to believe that being the Golden Child is a better thing than being the Scapegoat  And that your Golden Child siblings got a better treatment  than you the Scapegoat  The narcissistic parent has fooled you  This isn’t true  The narcissistic parents have made it look like that to you just to make you feel like you did something wrong  But just because it looks like that  doesn’t mean it’s true  The Golden Child doesn’t have it better and here’s why   The Golden Child never see through the abuse of the narc parents  The Scapegoat does Partly the reason why you’re the Scapegoat is because you saw through the bullshit of your narcissistic parents and actually have the guts to stand up to them  Some Golden Childs will never see this  I have an Golden Child sister and she always advocates for ny narc parents their abuse and will always tolerate it  no matter what  Being the Golden Child is sad  because they lack the self respect to stand up for themselves   The Golden Child never breaks free from the narcissist  The Scapegoat do This is because of the reason i mentioned above  The Golden Child doesn’t have the guts to stand up to the narcissistic parents  let alone break free and go no contact  But the Scapegoat will  because of the reason that they stop tolerating the abuse   The Golden Child doesn’t have an identity of their own  The Scapegoat do The reason why you’re the Scapegoat isn’t because you’re the problem  It’s because you actually have an identity and life outside the narcissist  and that is what they don’t like  But the Golden Child doesn’th have these things  And it’s sad  because my Golden Child sister is incapable of making her own decisions and incapable of having her own personal opinions as she’s so dependant and obiedent on my narcissistic mother and she will never fully grow up  It must be horrible to be the Golden Child   The Golden Child goes through abuse  just like the Scapegoat This is a thing we often forget  but always have to remember  The Golden Child got abused  too  Yes  in a different way  but abuse is abuse  no matter what  The Golden Child didn’t got less abuse as the Scapegoat  they’re as broken as us  just a different kind of broken  But broken  I witnessed it myself once  when my narcissisitic mother was on the phone with my Golden Child sister  i heard my narc mother being abusive to my GC sister   The Golden Child is incapable of building geniune relationships  But the Scapegoat do I see this often with my Golden Child sister as her relationships always fail or they’re not genuine  Because she always expects to be treated like a Queen  if people don’t treat her like that  she throws them in the trash  My GC sister would throw a temper tantrum if her friends forget it’s her birthday  and she will stop hanging out with them  untill they wish her Happy Birthday  It’s sad to see her living this life,2990,519
823,p6nr6z,0,6,years and  fillings later First time poster  long time reader  Unsure how to go about this  really  but reading through so many of these has brought some interesting memories back up for me and I wanted to share one that still haunts me in the middle of the night  Also on mobile so apologies for that  Long story short  I moved  miles from home and never looked back  I’ve had to learn to do basic adult things on my own and one of the big ones was dental care  Finally  I had my own insurance and I got the nerve to go to the dentist  I am terrified of the dentist  Can’t explain it  super irrational detrimental fear of something so simple  But I make the appointment and go  Turns out  I have to get  fillings throughout my entire mouth  There’s even extra issue with wisdom teeth needing to be pulled  My mother and I speak occasionally  she calls to complain about my dad  I just relay new events that have happened in my life  and the subject of my dental care comes up  She’s surprised by the amount of work I need done but then she quickly forgets and rants about my dad instead  A few weeks go by before I get the call where she tells me she found the paperwork from the last time she had taken me to the dentist  It was a big deal because she had gotten dentures at the same time I had last been in  She started to brag to me that it had been  years since that last visit  “Can you believe it ” She actually bragged to me that it had been so long and how everything had turned out fine   years  I had to have two wisdom teeth removed because they came in crooked and were useless   fillings  and I have dental cleanings every  months because of periodontal disease  I don’t understand why she thought it was a feat of strength to never go to the doctor dentist when I was growing up,1820,350

826,p6ndta,0,3,Should I go no contact with NP  First post here  I’m F and have lived outside of NP’s house for  years  I moved out as soon as I legally could  Basically  I started this routine of calling NP once per week to keep in touch whilst also maintaining boundaries  The routine started about  months ago now  Every time I come off the phone to her I feel like crap  I’m drained  tired  and upset  It’s like talking to my abuser every week  NP’s husband has anger problems and hurt me as a child  I hear him on the phone when I call her  She has always insisted that I call him ‘dad’  I’d love to go no contact  My problem is I have a young brother   y o   If I go no contact  I’ll surely never get to speak to him again  Then again  he’ll be  in four years  Do I hang around for that  or bail and hope he forgives me  Do you guys have any advice about what I should do  Or perhaps what you’ve done in a similar situation,928,182
827,p6mmgz,0,6,Preferring to meet with only you  Is it part of the damaging things an N parent does to insist on spending time with you alone  An example  mine would not spend time with me and my partner and said would only meet with me individually   Compared to my other parent who wanted to spend some time with just me on a recent visit  but was very amiable to several meals with my partner there  Plus N parent hugs in such an odd way  Extends arm out and places open hand on the back of my neck  Then pulls me close   I think most people place their hand and attached arm on shoulders and upper back rather than neck  Also  it isnt so much a pull of the person towards you as a mutual moving towards each other   I call it a boa constrictor hug and have banned N parent from doing that specific thing  They do this silly laugh as though is so cute and hysterical but does respect my absolute refusal to engage in such a hug  Which is good for my sanity   By the way  I vary between minimal contact due to being busy  due to not liking N parent very much  and outright avoidance due to stuff they have said or done that so far misses the mark on the things I say will be meaningful to me that I feel irritated  Or we get into arguments cuz hold her to the same respectful communication standard I ask of everyone in my life  I moved far away and that helped a lot  Wanting my contact is a big motivator for gradually getting them to meet my needs in the ways I ask and not in whatever arbitrary ways they decide I ought to appreciate,1537,292

sister a  truck stop skank    Called my brother  Harold   his name isnt Harold  was done w sarcasm   Not sure why  Harold  was chosen   Not a goodly based reason  Im sure Punched my brother in the face at least once    saw it while I was hiding across the street in bushes at the neighbours   Dad cracked my brother right accross the face   Saw w my own eyes   The reason   Hed come home late   Saw my brother crying  after this incident When I was in st or nd grade  informed me that  I love you bc youre my child  but I dont  like  you    You dont ever forget that type of statement Went away to camp for a week or so one summer   Upon return  was informed   When you were away at camp  your siblings didnt miss you at all  by one parent  in the dark garage  just the two of us   Now  I knew this was a lie  I loved my siblings to the bone  amp  knew they loved me also   we are all friends for life  to this day   Sick parent just wanted to hurt me  IncitefulInsights is not good at  anything   Whatever IncitefulInsights does  do the opposite   a mantra they tried to instill in my siblings Did not purchase clothing or shoes for me   I had to steal shoes as a teenager   BC of my religious upbringing I was scared to steal from any store  so I stole from the lost and found at school   this was somehow acceptable to me   I developped  amp  executed an elaborate plot  amp  stole the shoes out of the lost  amp  found in the gym teachers office   The result was me ending up wearing ill fitting  worn out shoes some other kid had  lost   or cast off    I knew even whose shoes they were originally   whenever that kid would see me wearing the shoes  they would look at my feet  then give me the wierdest look   I think the kid knew I  stole  their shoes   BONUS  one of my parents  worked at the school    They saw me wearing the lost  amp  found shoes  shoes they didnt buy me  and said  nothing  Did not provide sufficient food  so I was underweight   Shamed me for what food I DID eat   Shamed me for my acne  blamed me for having acne   Said it was bc I  ate too much chocolate    I liked chocolate  sometimes bought myself a chocolate treat  they begrudged my liking chocolate  having a treat   Made fun  Blamed me liking chocolate for my normal teenage acne  expected my skin to be   clear all the time  or else it was my fault   Ridiculed me for seeking a dermatologists care to treat my pretty severe acne which WAS NOT caused by eating chocolate  but ultimately  hormones   Gaslighted me by first paying for my acne treatment drugs prescribed by dermatologist  w their insurance plan  then suddenly demanding I give them the money back  bc I owed them  or withholding reimbursement for said drugs Id paid for out of pocket when I was still a minor covered by their insurance plan Resented my small earnings from a part time job  tried to make me pay for  services  in my own home as would be expected to pay for services in a hotel   Wanted my part time job money Shamed me for using toilet paper bc it costs money   They  shouldnt have to pay  for  my  toilet paper Accused me of theft for using hygiene products in the house   Using hygiene products stored in a bathroom cabinet was  stealing     You took all the xxxx   when I had taken just only what I needed and legitimately for hygiene purposes   If they saw I used any  that was  stealing  it Whenever something went missing in the house  assumed I had  stolen  it   Talked loudly  amp  repeatedly  about me being the thief culprit of having  stolen  the missing item  in my my siblings presence   Told me many times   youre a thief   if something got lost or went missing in the disorganized mess of a household Made me feel unwelcome in my own home to the point I got rid of most of my possessions so as not to take up any space    my room consisted of just a bed bedding  an empty shelf and maybe an empty desk or something   I had a small closet upon which I self installed a lock with key   I had the only key   They hated that  but for some reason  tolerated me keeping my small qty of stuff  mostly about  or  days clothes rotation  some books  and a few sentimental trinketts given me by relatives who genuinely loved me  but lived far away  in the locked closet  thus taking up little space and my presence in the home not being at all visible Did not do my laundry of the few clothes I did have  or did a slovenly job   Around age   I taught myself to do my own laundry by  watching the washing machine   opening the lid  amp  watching the dial at diff parts of the cycle to see how things worked  learning the laundry cycle   Thereafter I was able to appropriately launder my own clothes  actually  maybe that was a blessing as its a life skill  one I self taught to myself Did not assist me w homework or schooling beyond nd grade  then punished me for bringing home bad grades   Teachers tried to send notes home to find out what was going on  but I always hid the notes bc I feared wrath  amp  didnt understand what was in the notes  just that I would be punished for getting them Forced me into difficult  highly avoidable awkward situations    thats a whole can of worms    caused me to lose touch with friends Wanted me to get a serious  money earning job at  or    Saw me  amp  my siblings as ready for the workforce  amp  ready to take over personal expenditures around age     Demanded we all get jobs out of the blue one day in the middle of the summer   One day  were carefree playing outside w the neighbourhood kids  the next  were all obliged to be looking for serious jobs   A  job search  was organized by parents for us  featuring idiocy including loading us all into the van  carting us kids all around town in the van to every fast food joint   amp  forcing us to go in  amp  fill out job applications   None of which were ever replied to   When that failed  the next step was more serious    bringing us   amp  yr olds to the  Government employment office  to hunt for jobs on the job board there  this was well before internet was a thing    Place stank  was super depressing  and full of unnemployed adults  mostly immigrant men    The jobs posted there were adult oriented  amp  not meant for   year old kids   Stuff like   Senior Buyer    Engineer   or  Head Office Manager    We wandered all around  looking for something we were qualified  could apply to  while one parent watched   Spent a goodly amount of time in the govt employment office that summer  assessing whether we were qualified to apply as  Production Line Supervisors  or  Accounts Receivable Bookkeepers   Parents also put a ton of effort that summer into  getting all of us set up w official Social Insurance Numbers  amp  cards  to be ready to enter the workforce    In retrospect  this ended up being a good thing to have done  but it came not from a place of wanting to do right by us  but rather of wanting us to become income earners at age  and    Guess parents were tired of having  freeloading  kids   Especially the stay at home rotter Asked me if I knew  who paid for that peanut butter   I dared to eat As soon as they knew I had a bit of

833,p6ln2l,0,4,Nparents kept me in such a controlling bubble that I never learned what   was until th grade  I was  when it happened so it’s understandable that they didn’t tell me then  but they didn’t even MENTION it as I got older  It was as if it never existed  I remember standing in a moment of silence every year before the pledge of allegiance in class on a certain day and not knowing what it was for  Ndad even bragged about me being “part of the last age group of children that didn’t know what   was” as if that was something to be proud of  And yet all of the kids in my class  who were my age  knew about it and many remembered it Keeping this information from me was also in the context of nparents keeping me heavily isolated from the outside world  They controlled who I could be friends with  every single thing that I ate  and everything I did  This was not a case of a child being happy and his parents not wanting to tell him about a terrorist attack to keep him safe  It was yet another way that they controlled the information that I had available to me Do any of you relate to this  Doesn’t have to be with    just the extreme control of information by your nparents,1191,227

838,p6l5jd,0,2,What happened here  No contact ended  days ago  Background  my dad and I are both stubborn and alcoholic  But I reinitiated contact  days ago  And it’s relevant that I used to do his wound care all the time when I was in nursing school  I had hoped to hold on to living with him  but he kicked me out when my mom left  So my dad called me and these are my impressions from the phone call  he started out just saying that it wasn’t important but then he started talking about his legs  He said the chronic wounds on his legs were acting up and he started asking me advice about wound care dressingsBut he kept circling back to allude to the fact that he wanted someone  me  to come over and do wound care on him  So I told him… I said “please let me cut you off  You need home health  I don’t know if you have a Case Manager from all your previous surgical cases…  or if you need one… but YOU need to advocate for the case manager to refer you to home health wound care ”And he said no So then we started kind of talking about our schedules and he was carrying on for a very long time about when he thought his Amazon package of his wound care supplies that he ordered himself would be delivered… But i interrupted him again  and said  “you know what…  if you need me I will come over but I’m working on Thursday and I’m only available little bit on Wednesday… but if you call me…  I would come and you don’t have to say another word about it ”So then he talked for a really long time about how embarrassed he was  and how he didn’t want his family to know  and his doctor to know  that his legs were acting up  He just wanted to put these wound care dressings on them And so I said “OK listen… maybe this isn’t the most professional thing but I do have friends and sometimes I call on them to do simple assessments over the phone or… sometimes it’s really a doctor…or… I know wound care nurses…   This situation is outside of the realm of professionalism… but i could refer you to a friend of mine to get an initial assessment   She might say “go ahead and do your own stuff” or “you should get hydrafera blue dressings” or “you really need to go to to the hospital ” But I could phone a friend  And I know a case manager to who could like look at your stuff and she’d be able to tell you…” oh Aetna insurance  I completely understand  I know exactly what Documentation i need to authorize you for a home health wound care nurse ”And then he kind of started getting weird… like “I don’t know why I asked you for advice  I don’t mean to sound hostile…but just Nevermind   and I just I didn’t even mean to ask you  Just don’t tell anyone  ”And I said “well I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable I was offering you several solutions “so where did we leave  it “Do you want me to come over to do wound care or do you want me to ask my friends to assist you with your case management or wound care needs…or like…when  What time ”And he was all of a sudden obviously in a bad mood and he said in like the most sarcastic way…he’s like “you know what “Name” I love you  I got everything I needed  thanks” and then he hung up,3155,600
839,p6kzem,0,2,NMom Dismissing my Entire Experience    As always  TL DR    I decided to explain to her my self harm story   why I fell into that horrible cycle  when I was   and guess what  She says it was not because of what I described to her and basically invalidated everything  Now  at   she repeatedly refers to my choice to  carve myself up  every time we fight  most recent fight where she said she would throw me down the stairs and kill me herself    amp  xB So Im F   History of self harm  depressive episodes and general anxiety  Im an only child   a third year university student  aiming for grad school  med school hopefully  and live with a single mom  I cook all the meals  I clean  do the chores  I study and work   my moms very sick so she cant do things very quickly  From a young age Ive been helping out My moms gone through a lot of abuse  struggles and has a chronic illness   shes also a shining example of an amazing professional  has  masters degrees  speaks multiple languages and is the peak of  going through it tough but surviving Shes also a Narcissistic Martyr   undiagnosed  but youll see why as I continue below  NOTE  I NEVER DISS SOMEONES TRAUMA AND LIFE EXPERIENCES  BUT I DO NOT AGREE WITH HURTING OTHERS AS A RESULT OF IT  Im her personal punching bag  Ive had to be her friend  mother at times  support  confidant  daughter    everything  Boundaries are not a thing  Privacy  lol  forget it Growing up I was always walking on eggshells Didnt go to prom Didnt go to school dances  in middleschool nor HS    I did go to one in elementary Had my phone checked often   Was not allowed to hang out with friends often   mostly only for birthday parties or specific events   and when I did she had to either be there or know the parents and if I was allowed to   it was for a short time only As a young child   fine I accepted this  After all my safety was her priority But it just made me sneakier Went to an all girls school for my whole school education Long story short I got a BF at   Fell in love  puppy love of course  and decided to tell my mom She disagreed  for many reasons  distraction to studies  he wasnt from our ethnic background  awful i know   he wasnt good enough for me  Break up with him  She said  as I sat across her over lunch  But why    I dont like him  no  Breakup ANd so I did   But I kept seeing him around at tutoring centre where I was enrolled  and for both of us who were shy  academically focused kids  this was a beautiful moment So for several weeks we broke up This ruined me  and I felt awful  it was exciting and happy for me to get a little valentines card  to have some affection  I was   studying hard to get into my college of choice I felt obliged to do what she said  But I felt compelled to not do it either I was self harming  slowly at first  Across my thighs and my stomach  IT gave me release  Dont ask me why  it just did And then we got back together secretly Seeing him was an hour or so here  a few minutes there  Some small drives  It was nothing disastrous  Dangerous or wrong But I felt guilty  I felt like the worst person on earth  I wanted to share the cute little moments with my mom  Something I had thought all girls will do   She always told me to trust her and tell her everything   yet over the years I had noticed everything I told her would come back to bite me in an argument   I had snuck him home one day   for only an hour  where we cooked a little as i had to have food ready before my mom came home  and spent time together And when my mom found out I did this Well  naturally  I was called a whore A lying Disobedient Whore  I hadnt even had sex but she never believed that Fights ensued  my phone was taken  Hair was pulled  She told him never to contact me again  And for months I was forced to go everywhere with her  Glued so she can watch me  So she can make sure I wasnt doing it again She read my private messages aloud and called me names for hours  My self harm flared and got worse  Im  and the scars havent really faded One day she saw my scars  I was changing and she walked in  I quickly tried to hide them but she forced me to show her my stomach  amp  xB  why would you do this  why would you do this to me  You want to hurt me  huh Hurt her  I was hurting her I couldnt come to her with my concerns or issues   she told me not to trust my friends because they all want the worst for me  she said people will look badly upon me because im a dirty whore for lying about having a boyfriend and she called up my friends to ask them what they knew  You wasted your senior year  you got bad marks  you were more interested in boys  you disregard everything ive gone through for you      Flash forward to now  Im   Fights continue every few months  When I do what she says  all things are fine But I cant go anywhere  Without her express knowledge  without her taking me there herself and waiting in the car for me    BUT ITS FOR YOU OWN SAFETY I CANT HAVE YOU DRIVING SO FAR AWAY   Privacy is still not a thing for me If i want privacy  its because I want  to hide something  Because  from a young age I have shown that I am a lying  selfish  lazy  whore  She wants me to find a nice guy from our culture   but if I meet someone she insists on reading all the texts  taking me to and from dates  listening in on calls    safe to say Ive only dated one guy in the last  years since  and that was only  dates cause he had enough of her meddling  and fair enough   Over the years Ive just gotten sneakier  Im an adult  I have friendships she cant control  and thoughts she cant overpower  I try my best to be resilient  and not fall into self harm again  although have relapsed countless times  Our fights are constant  horrific and often get violent  And it all goes back to her point     ever since you were  everything changed  youre not the daughter I knew      Lazy  Selfish  Ungrateful    Bitch    Whore   Crazy amp  xB I mean these are only a few of the epithets Ive hard chiseled into my heart from my mother My loving mother  who sacrificed her whole life to have me  Ive gone through so much  Ive given up everything  other mothers go out and have fun and I sacrificed all of this to raise you  I shouldve brought other men into the house but I didnt i stayed by you I didnt have any other relationships  you turned my house into a brothel     by bringing my then boyfriend over Youre ungrateful  youre spoiled  Ive given you too much freedom and too much opportunity and you respect nothing  Ive been sick with my chronic illness and I worked so hard to raise you and this is how you repay me    I usually ignore these fights  they usually occur after I try to set a boundary  Dont touch my phone  her answer  I PAY For that phone I get to see it  I cant come to you with my problems because you gaslight me and you yell at me  her answer   YOU KNOW ITS THE WRONG THING AND YOU DO IT ANYWAY  I cant afford to move out  so I live with her still   Anyway  now I have a boyfriend    The love of my life  the man Im hoping I will marry  cause we both come from abusive single parent homes and we understand each other well Anyway hes not from my culture  but i mean i literally do not give a shit   No one CHOOSES their race   And can I just say all of this culture business is covert racism and I do not give a fuck about endorsing it hes the most respectful  caring  supportive amazing human being and he loves me truly But   NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU LIKE ME  YOUR MOTHER DOES     NO ONE   Eh  I call bullshit  Because the older ive gotten the more I can see her flaws  She makes mistakes  Shes not the omniscient god she portrays herself to be  and iM sorry shes not a flawless martyr  Its NOT my responsibility to fill the voids in her life or to fix the abuse she went through Hurt people  hurt people  I get it  But ive had enough She never takes responsibility for hurting me  everything that I point out is disrespectful or wrong is disregarded because I am the child   The feet cannot hit the head  I am the feet   my moms the head    so regardless of what she says or does  She is correct Always She knows better Anyway  she says Ive changed recently  she doesnt know me and my bf are dating she knows we are friends  and I ignore her  In our most recent argument where I said Ive had enough of her invasion of my privacy  Shit hit the fan Youre spending too much time talking to that guy   he had given me notes for some classes and she picked them up and threw them everywhere on the ground things escalated I cant even be bothered to go into detail  yall already know how these things snowball  I went into my room packed a bag and said fuck this  im leaving Yeah I had   in my bank account and nowhere to go but fuck it  I was upset She comes into my room and says    EVERYTHING YOU OWN IS MINE I PAID FOR IT YOU CAN TAKE NOTHING GO WITH WHAT YOURE WEARING AND EVEN THAT IS MINE    We fight  we struggle  she pulls my hair as I try to leave  her hands are weak but boy can she hit   Once she had me on the floor in the corner and stepped on me as if I was a cockroach  but she says that never happened so idk guys maybe Im just crazy     Shes violently flailing at me and i push her off of me on the bed i dont want her touching me  I yell at her to get her hands off me Anyway  i manage to break free with this bag ive got and i get to the stairs and she says  IF you try to go I will push you down the stairs She threatens to fucking kill me right And I said  no im leaving idc Mind you  she tells me to go but i am her primary carer  shes not severly disabled itll just take her more time to do things that I usually assist her with   and the point is she doesnt WANT me to go because thatll be inconvient to her  amp  xB OH ALSO  she got offended once because I said when I leave and get married  she wont live in the same house as me and my husband  I mean  Obviously not Anyway the screaming match goes on for hours  Slut  whore  disgrace  dirty person  ungrateful  dishonest It doesnt end  I walked out of the house  andwithin minutes she calls me   i wasnt gonna answer  but I did  And she begged me to come back because its not safe  COVID is everywhere here too Anyway I did and we had another fight today over something completely menial Eventually im gonna move out  and I try my best to keep myself sane But Im angry and hurt Idk why I wrote all this  I just felt the need to get it out  amp  xB Yours truly The embarassing  selfish  whore from nextdoor,10808,1974

843,p6kmae,0,4,Mom steals my things and lies about it Hey guys Im not really sure how to handle this situation but I didnt realize it was happening up until a few months ago  The first instance was when I was about to leave on a trip with my friends  I was gonna pack Uno  which I always leave under my deck of Cards Against Humanity  but it was gone  I asked my siblings and none of them had seen it  I asked my mom and she said  I dont touch your guys stuff so I dont know  and I could tell she was mad that I even asked  I picked up on this and accused my brother on purpose so that she would admit it  She didnt admit it  she took them out from the hallway closet and said  it looks like you left them in here   Mind you  I never put anything in that closet because thats where we keep the towels and toilet paper lmao  She sounded so convincing I even felt crazy for a second  The most recent instance  just now  I had my candle that I got for my st birthday on my TV stand  Its always propped up on a wooden coaster right next to my mug  When I was watching TV just now  I noticed the mug was on the coaster in place of where the candle would usually be  It didnt even fit on the coaster so it was just lopsided and completely out of place  I confronted my mom again and she sais she dropped it when she was in my room and didnt wanna drop it again so she put it in the hallway closet  Its always like walking on eggshells when I talk to her and I have no idea what to do anymore or how to even approach this  She makes me feel crazy when she says it wasnt her doing and I always end up frantically looking for these items  not realizing most of the time that she steals little things so that I dont notice until way later or dont even bother bringing it up  She also draws symbols on my pictures I have with friends  Is it unreasonable for me to feel mad about this  Because she guilts me when I get upset about it and I dont even know how to express my feelings now  Please help TLDR  my mom lies about stealing from me and gets upset when I bring it up  how do I approach this,2092,421
844,p6kepc,0,2,A discovery I made today Today in therapy  I  F  realized that Im allowed to grieve for the dad I really didnt get as a child  I went NC with my dad because he violated my boundaries and tried manipulating me into doing things I was uncomfortable with  Also  hes mentally unstable and dabbles in alcohol and drugs  Even though my mom makes jokes about nobody loving him and telling me to stop being sad on Fathers Day  my therapist helped me realize that I dont have to be happy and grateful all the time  Im allowed to miss my dad  Im allowed to reminisce about good times Ive had with him and yearn for reconciliation again Also  Ive learned that its not just my dad whos like this  My mom says things to me that are downright abusive  Im in denial about it  but she disrespects me regularly and does not respect my boundaries  I learned that I can be angry at her too  Both of my parents have caused me a lot of anxiety and depression  I don’t have to be grateful for any of that  I am allowed to be angry  It feels so good to get that off my chest  I can’t wait to start my own life and go to college,1121,215
845,p6kbxk,0,2,Been a rough day First post here so hope I do this right…I’d  F  been doing well recently in dealing surviving with my awful family until today  I’ve found a volunteer activity that I love  gets me out of the house  I love the great people I volunteer with  it’s really helping with my terrible self confidence  and I’m only a few months away from finally paying off my student loans  the payments were so much each month that I’ve had to live at home with my family while I pay them off so I can afford payments for my own place to live  Then today was awful  I woke up and found out my younger brother had a sore throat headache cough etc and so he was staying home from his job  He works at the same warehouse as my mom  is autistic  but is not very “high functioning”    so basically he stayed home because he tends to not deal with illness well and my mom just “didn’t want to deal with him” getting upset at work today  he gets frustrated that he can’t just take a magic pill or something to make a cold back pain whatever’s bothering him go away instantly and so he basically throws a fit like a little kid would   So this is just great news for me   while I’m fully vaccinated  my job is pretty strict on following CDC guidelines while we’re in the office  I was supposed to go in to the office today  so I had to text my boss this morning so she can confirm that no  I can’t come in to work today because we don’t know what my brother has  Best part is  my parents think Covid is just fake news or a plot by the government to control people  The fact that I just quit a second job not too long ago where I was working as an EMT for a private ambulance company and actually had Covid positive people in my ambulance on my shifts  Nope  not even having a healthcare worker in their family who saw proof Covid exists can convince them Covid is real  Of course no one else in my family besides me is vaccinated… my brother with his disability doesn’t know any better than what my parents tell him so he’s been just as careless as my parents have during this whole pandemic  So he could very well have Covid… or he could just have a cold  I might never know what he’s sick with because my parents laughed at me when I suggested they see if he can get tested  Because he “doesn’t have Covid” because Covid isn’t real to them  They’ve been extra nasty with me all day today for daring to mention that he should get tested and for trying to explain how not knowing what he has puts my life in limbo  Can’t go in to work or do volunteer work if I might’ve been exposed to Covid  and dad just mocked me for it  “oh what’s the matter  can’t go out and volunteer  Inconveniencing your job  Wow that’s just too bad isn’t it  Oh boo hoo ”I’ve been getting either the silent treatment or nasty comments thrown my way all day  you know how the anti mask Covid denying crowd is   I had to rearrange work things with my boss today because we’re in the middle of our busiest time of year  and now me being back to working from home everyday instead of in the office messes up the plan  I think my boss understands I can’t help my family being like this  I hope she’s not just saying that but actually thinking I’m a pain in the ass and holding this whole thing against me now  Can’t go in to the office for awhile now  All because my brother won’t get tested so I know what I’m dealing with  I’ve been trying not to worry about what if my brother does have Covid and I get sick from it even though I’m vaccinated  He was wandering around the house all day coughing on everything Worst of all though is how this whole situation is probably going to sideline me for awhile from the volunteer work I do  I’m on a search and rescue  SAR  team and I love it  It’s been the one bright light since I’ve been stuck living at home paying off student loans  The people on my team are wonderful… sane  caring  funny  smart  mentors to me in SAR and just in general as far as what it’s like to know older people who aren’t terrible people like my parents are  It’s done wonders for my awful self confidence  really  my self confidence dwells in the pits   I think they might actually like having me around on the team  which is huge for me to feel like I’m accepted belong somewhere  And hell  I get to help people and maybe find a missing person at the same time which is freakin great But I’m not sure how I can go to meetings trainings actual searches for the next week or so knowing my brother could have Covid and I could get my team sick or the other area SAR teams that we search with sick  I have an annual fitness test in a few days that I have to pass to stay on the team and I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go now  My parents just couldn’t care less about what’s important to me  my whole life they never have  or how their actions  in this case thinking a global pandemic is a total joke  affect anyone else  Once again my parents ruin a good thing I enjoy doing  It really puts me in an awfully sad place knowing I probably shouldn’t do SAR for the next week or so  so that I don’t risk getting anyone sick  If they could’ve taken the pandemic seriously or would at least get my brother tested maybe I wouldn’t be in this position And what prompted me to post this now  We literally just had a SAR request come through for us to go look for a missing person and I had to make myself say no because I’m worried I could get them all sick with whatever my brother has  What if it is Covid   I don’t want getting my teammates sick on my conscience  So I’m sitting here feeling like I’m letting my team down and I’m also completely miserable because I can’t go out and help look for this missing person  All because my parents think Covid is a joke and refuse to take my brother to get tested for Covid  Just the worst way to end a real awful day and I feel terrible and furious Tonight Im probably going to cry a little more  hope Covid isn’t circulating in this house  and hope this missing person is found by the SAR folks that could go out Tomorrow I’m going to start asking people I know to recommend a realtor   see if I can start the condo buying process  And I’m going to call my doctors office and beg them to write me an order to be  tested for Covid  stupid HMO plan rules  or at least see if they can give me advice for how long I should avoid going out in public when someone in my house has a mystery illness  As much as this day is hurting  I’m not going to have much more like this because I’m determined to get out soon  I’m

846,p6kbqw,0,3,NDad denies any of the trauma he’s caused me So i’m posting this on my mobile device so i’m sorry for any errors or whatever anyways  for years my mom has said how my dad is a N  and honestly as i get older i can sorta see it  but i will be honest  i love my dad and he has always been there for me  especially through my parents divorce  but now that i look back on it  i can see how my dad wanted me to potentially testify against my mom in court  which i can’t remember what it was now but it was probably about something i was mad at when i was younger   eventually  i grew older and i grew closer to my mom  especially during COVID   but almost a year ago  i just got my license and i’m a little new to the road  but my dad tried to get me to drive the highway after only about having my license for a couple of days  i said no and my dad gets into an argument about how i should just do it  eventually we stop and get gas  and i’ve calmed down so i suggested that i drive the rest of the way  not on the highway   he ends up sleeping in the back while i drive  and my sister and i swear that we saw him drinking some whiskey shooters in the back of the car  we eventually make it to our destination and he suggests we should go to a friends house that is currently being built  all of HIS friends are there and it’s just my sister and i  eventually one of my family friends comes and we were talking upstairs in the sun  my dad and his friend tried going up an unstable ladder when there was stairs  ft away  my dad climbed up the ladder with a drink in his hands  he made it almost to the top but then the ladder went out from under him  i was in shock and my family friend rushed to go help him  she ended up saving him but minutes later my dad forgets completely that he almost died and his daughters would have watched  i came to the conclusion that i was done with this situation and i felt that if i stayed i could potentially hurt my entire family  so my sister and i left with my family friend WILLINGLY my dad  maybe  mins later  notices were gone and demands we come back to him  we don’t but he calls the police saying we were kidnapped  the police come and we said we went willingly with my friend  my dad didn’t like that and tried to get us back  eventually my sister and i get back home and we are just shocked that this has happened  my dad called texted us   for at least   weeks  now  a year later he denies this situation EVER happened and has avoided any sort of apologies that i feel i need to get better   now a year later  another situation has happened where we found out he was abusing drugs  he admitted doing drugs but i honestly think he only admitted it because his family was there  now a couple of months later he denies doing drugs and i feel like he’s lying about going to therapy  honestly  i just want to know if my dad really is a N  and i want to know how i should deal with him in the future,2963,592
847,p6k8ko,0,2,Yelling at your children WONT IMPROVE THEIR EDUCATION I am absolutely bewildered at my parents for yelling at my poor sibling  Theyre getting As and Bs in school  My mom especially is livid  forcing my dad to help improve their grades  He has an incredibly short temper when things dont go his way  so you can only imagine how that goes I cant intervene because itll only make matters worse for the both of us  Been there  done that But its so painful simply sitting there  frozen  All I here is Stop   hit  Playing   slap  Games   whack    And I feel so guilty for crying  even though Im not the victim experiencing it first hand  I feel bad when I get frustrated at my sibling because theyve already been through so much  Seeing them flinch at every movement scares me  Watching them find an outlet through gaming is so painful too   because I know how disapproving my parents are when it comes to that kind of stuff  Sometimes  I wonder what would happen to my sibling if I was gone from this world,1022,177

849,p6k7rd,0,3,Everything is perfect  until its not  So  I grew up being told by my family that we were a perfect family  that we had a perfect life  and that we didnt need anyone else but the family  Ive only recently fully realized how wrong that was  and how traumatized I am by my upbringing  Ive been emotionally and verbally abused by both of my parents since I was a child  in various different ways  including isolation  They refused to send us  me and my younger sibling  to school  The only friends I had were ones I would meet around town when I was allowed out to play  Even then I was always told that I focus too much on  outside people  and that I was always looking for validation from others when all I needed was them  something they still say to me now  even though I am an adult in my s  Adding a lack of close family  my parents not having friends  and being raised very religiously  created two kids who were very codependent on their parents  which is how they like it  The worst part is that it took me so long to realize all of this because of how loving they both are toward us  It made the fairytale of us being this perfect family seem very true and real to me for so long  They even used our so called perfect life as a reason that my sibling and I shouldnt have any mental problems  which they would deny now if I mentioned it  but then again they would deny any of this has any merit  even though I know it does  Even now though  I am worried to move out  although I really want to  Because I have always been told I have no reason to do so  that rent is expensive  that Id never make it out there  that I need to stay here with them  I am still going to move out  very soon  but I know it will come with guilt trips and manipulation to try and make me stay  I have pondered if its worth the pit in my stomach that comes along with it  but I know it is  I know that until I get out Ill never get to finally live and actually experience anything,1972,386
850,p6k5dw,0,2,Financial dependence Got out of school  was pushed into studying and told to not get a job as to focus on uni and rely on them for house etc  this ruined my resume as I have a chunk of time without a job  Because of this I went into postgrad and have been forced again to avoid work and study to receive financial support  I don’t qualify for financial support from the government and any jobs I’ve been able to get don’t cover rent or food  I now get condemned for being lazy for not working while I study despite being told to do it  The rest of my family hasn’t lived with my nparents for at least   years as I’m the youngest and don’t remember what it’s like so I’m shunned and blamed for it all  seen as lazy  I’ve been depressed since I was a kid and am going through extensive therapy  Recently  like a hr period  my nparents have offered to buy me a home to live in  and already placed an offer on the house  as I want to have kids soon  I want to take the opportunity but my parents are just emotionally abusing me over it all  I’m trying my best to be a normal human being and not rely on them but I’ve been forced into a position where it’s either accept their help and it’s strings or be homeless  It’s an investment into the future but I’m finding it so hard to be myself  feel like a respected adult and not be effected by my family’s perception of me  I was the ‘cause’ in my half siblings eyes for their parents to break up and have been despised since I was a baby  The rest of my family all knows how intense and demanding my parents are but always ignore this fact when it comes to judging me  I am hated  for existing  I just feel like my life is spiralling any type of agency or control I grasp at is taken away or used to abuse me  When I reach out no one recognised my situation or what I’m going through  I am made to feel worse and ungrateful despite it making me suicidal  I’m at a loss  my partner is getting second hand abuse from my parents now too and I just keep apologising and I know he doesn’t blame me for it but it’s so hard to have someone I care about have to go through this purely because of association  My brain is just on fire and I don’t know how to put it out,2209,438

860,p6jhpe,0,4,Nmom has almost no self awareness She has no internal or external self awareness She probably not only doesn’t care how she treats people  but also she doesn’t have any insight on how she treat other people  When she abuses people she thinks it’s other people abuse her  and she is bravely defending herself  She is so not developed as a person  like she is a fetus inside with all the power of a biologically adult  She is just so disgusting and weak  She drags so many people down just like her own disgusting nmom and n siblings  As a Harry Potter fan  I was thinking what would be my powerful happy thought I can use to defeat dementors  it would be the dream of  nmom disappearing from my and all my loved ones lives  be it she dies or whatever  I don’t care,770,142
861,p6jet4,0,3,I dont want to understand  The last few days have been so emotionally draining for me  It all started when I got an email from my n mom on Saturday  This is weird  because she never initiates contact  especially not over email  usually I call her and she talks endlessly about her life   The email says she wants to talk privately about something  and everyone is ok   So  no one is dying  I guess thats good  She also wants to talk over FaceTime  which is weird considering she hates video calls  I have no idea what she wants to talk about  but my partner and I speculate  maybe my parents are divorcing  maybe their business failed  maybe its some weird inheritance  My partner suggests its her calling to tell me she hates them  I schedule the call for Saturday knowing I have an appointment with my therapist on Tuesday to unpack it all When I get on FaceTime with her  we exchange a few pleasantries  and then she says   I assume you know why I want to talk to you   I respond that I do not know  Then she proceeds to tell me how she is shocked and appalled that my partner has been showing signs of being non binary  I know that my partner has been recently becoming more comfortable sharing that they are non binary online  including with a profile picture where they were wearing makeup  She says some things to indicate that shes seen this photo  She also talks about how my cousins kid recently came out as non binary and wants to become a woman  Her opinion is that being non binary means that you dont know what you want and your desired partner will change day to day  She then suggests that   in my book  this is grounds for annulment   She literally just told me to divorce my partner  whom I love  because she is afraid of them being non binary  At this point  my mind is spinning   what have I gotten myself into  So many thoughts going through my mind  I try to keep my cool and defend my partner  I dont want her to have the satisfaction of getting a rise out of me  I also point out that I am on the non binary spectrum  but because I was born female  thats somehow different to her  I asked her if I could provide some book recommendations to understand the difference between gender and sexuality  and her response was   I dont read  I dont want to understand  After several more derogatory statements about non binary and trans folx  she then shifts the conversation towards how she thinks my partner is not caring enough  Apparently   in her opinion  they are the reason Ive switched jobs  times in the last year  the reason I dont talk to her or her siblings  and the reason that I seem  so sad in the last few years   They also dont hold the door enough for me  Apparently  before I met my partner  my parents and I were a close  happy family with no issues  Unfortunately  she forgot about the part where she forced me to go to the same school she went to  where she broke into my email in the middle of the night  where she and my e dad would get drunk at the Mexican restaurant and talk about other people in the restaurant  where she freaked out that I didnt believe in the same religion as her  even though she never went to church herself   Throughout this whole conversation  she keeps switching between the topic at hand and doting on her cat  who obviously doesnt want to be held   as if its no big deal  She also suggests that I was starting to  get over  my introversion before I met my partner  and that they made me backslide on that  Introversion is not something to  get over    its a part of me  She finished the call by adding in some racist complaints before we ended the call Fast forward one day  and I get a message from my cousin  who rarely initiates conversations with me  She starts by asking something pretty tame  then after I respond  asks if I will visit home and tries to guilt me about visiting my grandma  and also tries to pull my nostalgia heartstrings  I recognize her flying monkey tactics  and dont engage with this  I can only imagine the rumors circulating in my n moms family about how I apparently need an intervention to get away from my non binary partner who has supposedly trapped me in a marriage Before all of this  I was under no illusion that my n mom liked my partner  but this really sealed the deal  My therapist was really upset by this story as well  After I write each of my parents letters to explain how I feel  as my therapist suggested  I think this might be the point at which I finally go NC with my parents,4528,823
862,p6jbjb,0,3,Cutting off my mom Hey guys  I’m sure this has been posted before at some point  but I’ve just recently cut my mom off and could use some advice  To give you some backstory  she is a kleptomaniac  pathological liar  cheater and most importantly  a narcissist  She was in and out of jail for a few years of the beginning of my life  and when she “came back” she was nothing but neglectful and emotionally  mentally and sometimes physically abusive  I have never in my life experienced another person like her  She is beyond selfish and ignorant  and has only ever apologized for the things she’s done to me when she was drunk or needed something from me  To sum it up  she ruined so many parts of my life  It was about  weeks ago that something inside of me finally clicked where I was at my wits end  but actually this time  She is blocked on everything  I moved out and have no plans to ever reconcile  For the past  years all that she has proven is that she doesn’t want to change and she does not care who it hurts  In the last couple days she has texted my brother and my dad to ask them if I miss her or if I’ll call her  It’s crazy because since cutting her off  I genuinely feel much lighter and that I finally have freedom  but I want to tell her off so badly to the point where it’ll keep me up at night even though i know it will make zero difference  I know that I won’t do it most likely because not only would i still be unsatisfied but it will just feed her ego  I also still find myself feeling guilty for cutting her off  even though this time she has no way to guilt trip me  What are some tips or any advice for truly moving forward  Or any advice for this type of situation in general,1707,333
863,p6ipc8,0,23,Should I go NC with nparents before announcing engagement  Hi all  Ive been lurking here for a while  This sub  and my therapist  have helped me navigate a lot of things as an adult child of nparents but I still have no idea where to start with this post😅 I  F  have been LC with my enabling covert nmum  ndad and gc flying monkey brother since April this year  I went NC  years ago after moving out of home  They started a smear campaign amongst all my extended family literally the same night  If those relatives didnt bully me  they ignored me  Some to this day  still refuse to acknowledge my existence because of how I  broke up the family  and hurt my parents by moving out so suddenly  I was pressured by relatives into speaking to my parents again  Being back in contact for  ish months last year just reminded me why I left  My nparents have not changed  they are just on their best behaviour which is so much more sinister and a total mindfuck  The effects of the initial smear campaign still traumatizes me so I have just been LC until I have gathered enough strength to decide what to do next  Trial and error I suppose  My partner  M  and I have been together since the same time I moved out  so sadly he was also dragged into the smear campaign and relatives accused him of  stealing  me away and  influencing  me  We have talked a lot about whether we want my side of the family involved in our lives much longer  He told me he plans to propose within the next few months and as excited as I am  I am also incredibly stressed because I know my family will try to exert their control and dominance over the entire thing  They wont be happy for me but they will absolutely wear the news like a badge to show off to everyone around them  They have overshadowed so many moments in my life  I dont want it to happen with this one  Deep down  I know going NC again with my parents will be in the cards   maybe the only card  I cant keep up LC long term  As much as I was in pain when I first went NC  I also had peace of mind like no other point in my life  I knew where I stood and so did everyone else  even if they were making a fuss about it  And just remembering how they acted when I moved out vs every other important milestone in my life  ranging from mockery  bullying  threats  sabotaging any plans i e  my st birthday party and even when I was starting my bachelors to physical violence and intimidation   I cant help but feel like I need to prepare in advance for how who I share our good news with when my partner proposes  I already knew at  years old I did not want my father walking me down the aisle and I cant see that conversation going down well  I already know Ill be hiring security bouncers for the day and wont be inviting   of his family to the wedding when it happens which also wont go down well  but hopefully they know better than to still expect niceties from a niece they abandoned and ostracized when she was in need  eye roll  Is it worth having these conversations and confronting them when the time comes to draw the line  Do I wait for them to fuck up somehow so I can cut them off or do I just rip the bandaid off now  seemingly unprovoked and risk the backlash way before it can possibly overshadow this next chapter in my life  Do I need to give them an explanation if I go NC Would appreciate your stories or suggestions♡ whether you are LC or NC TLDR  partner plans to propose soon   we  know relationship with my nparents is more harm than good  have been on the fence about keeping them in our lives for future milestones  Wait for them to show their true colours again or just go NC,3674,691

869,p6hxr3,0,3,Its the little stuff that sticks in my brain while I recover and go to therapy  When I was about  and my GC brother was nine  his boyscout troop went to the planetarium and I got to tag along  I was asked to watch the boys while the adults talked  there was some sort of delay  and I told them all myths about the stars  For the only time in my life  I kept an audience absolutely spellbound with stories from ancient myths  I had just read them  you see  so they were fresh in my mind  I loved the stars  I had star charts in my room  and I wanted a telescope  Well  my parents got my GC brother a telescope for Christmas  And even though he truly didnt care about it  and he was more than happy to share  I wasnt allowed to use it at all  In college I took an astronomy course  and my father threw a fit that I was thinking about making it my major   no jobs anyway  he said  a foolish impractical thing to study  He said that about every major  but he was particularly vocal about astronomy  Math was never my strong suite anyway so I didnt pursue astronomy  Three years ago  at Christmas  my GC little brother gave me a brand new telescope  Not an expensive one  hes not a well off man  but the gesture cut me to the soul  I thanked him for remembering I like the stars  and he said yeah  of course  It was a gesture that meant a lot to me and seemed to be a gesture of kindness from him  But I cant bring myself to use the damn thing  I cant get rid of it  its the only thoughtful gift my brothers ever given me  And I cant open it  for some reason  I just dont know why I cant bring myself to use it,1628,321

871,p6hup2,0,3,My nmom kept me on an SSRI for  years because  Temple Grandin takes Prozac   My nmom kept me on SSRIs from the time I was  until I was  and I flushed them down the toilet She had heard that Temple Grandin takes Prozac  or some other SSRI  and somehow the   Temple Grandin is autistic and she takes an SSRI and she says it can be good for some people with autism  so Im going to bully a psychiatrist into prescribing my autistic daughter Prozac  Prozac did a whole lot of absolutely nothing for me  and Im wondering if its possible that the depression Ive dealt with for the past  years could possibly be  in part  from taking an SSRI for so long so young and my brain never learning how to properly deal with serotonin  And  Ive got long term anorgasmia and a low sex drive that is possible that Prozac factored into  but theres no way to know for sure Im sick of my screwed up brain  and its hard to not be mad at my nmom for keeping me on meds  and my nparents and nbrother for demonizing me for not taking meds  They expected Prozac to turn me into a robot  and whenever I was a    human    with    free will    and    emotions     they would say  You didnt take your meds  You need to take your meds   even though I was taking them every single day  It was just a chance to demonize me By the way  Prozac had  effect on me,1352,254
872,p6hnjw,0,5,months officially NC with my Nmom and her enabling family  ask me anything    hey guys f  thought i would share my story  so my whole life my mom was abusing me and always had narc traits  but i didn’t realize until i was about  because that’s when it got worse  I grew into my own individuality and rejected her idea of having the perfect image all the time and being a completely different person behind closed doors  I was beaten if i didn’t clean my bathroom to her standards and she would make me stay up until   am on school nights because I didn’t clean to her standards   often times she would threaten to kick me out of “her room” because of this  my room was never super trashy so i never understood this she beat me because i wore makeup to school  keep in mind i am now a whole makeup artist influencer with thousands of views and company collaborations  i’m sure she hates this secretly but would put on a front   whenever i did makeup at home she would basically shame me   scream and tell me i needed to find something better to do with my time she would be nice to me for weeks and then just get really angry and snap for no reason  hold grudges  etc my family knew about this and would simply tell me to stop getting mad CPS case after case   which were all closed because no one could even believe a WOMAN would put her hands on her own daughter  she lied every time and said i was “rebellious “   when i was  she got jealous of the fact that i stayed out till  with my BOYFRIEND at the time that she supposedly liked so much  she argued with me the next day and got physically abusive and essentially fought me till i was bleeding from my mouth lived with my grandma  dormed at colleged   came back for summer vacation  i was now     mother made a surprise appearance and fought me again  this time   with my bf on facetime  she argued with him and said every childish thing you could think of moved out to my bfs house after the police STILL tried to justify this as us having a scuffle  been here ever since family was stalking my social media from fake accounts and never reached out to talk to me  nobody knows where i am  nobody knows about my well being  I guess it’s better that way my current bf never fails to make me feel loved and tells me daily how much of a beautiful person i am  inside and out to any person still stuck in this situation   i know its scary  but when you turn   it’s perfectly okay to run and not go back to the abuse  your mental health will thank you,2547,483

875,p6h0jh,0,228,It turns out  I have had an ear infection for the last  years or so  Around age  I started having itchy ears  They would peel and bleed and crust over  My parents asked a doctor about it and she said it was eczema and told them to put Lubriderm lotion on them  My mother really liked making me come into her room so that she could apply the lotion to my ears  This happened for years  and they never got any better  but my parents never tried to find out more about it  I wasnt allowed to put the lotion on myself  even in th grade  At some point my mother started applying the lotion with a q tip  I didnt like this because she wasnt very coordinated with the q tip  Also I didnt like that I was in th grade or so and not allowed to put lotion on myself  I told her that I didnt like the q tip method  She said that she had to use a q tip  or that the eczema would spread to her fingers  I told her eczema is not contagious   It is not   She said that it was because she had started to notice it on one of her fingers  She continued summoning me to her bedroom  often while I had a friend over so she could smear lotion on my ears until sometime in middle school But do you know what is contagious  Fungal skin infections  Which I have in my ears  And which I believe I have had untreated since i was  years old  In fact  adding a lotion probably makes it worse  I am treating it now  age    but it is taking a long time to heal  And my hearing is damaged because of the years of infection  I probably got it in a sandbox or something  Jesus Christ  Why did they not get me medicine,1603,317

878,p6gqiw,0,11,Dear mom  letter that I’ll never send    Hi everyone  This is my first post here  I look at all of yours daily and relate to a lot of them  This subreddit helps me feel less alone  Thank you for sharing your experiences and helping others feel less alone in this world  My therapist suggested that I write this as a way to forgive my mother  Not for her sake  but for mine  I finally have the courage to make a post  although I’m not sure how confusing it may be for strangers  as it doesn’t explain a lot of what I’m referencing  Trigger warning  childhood sexual trauma Dear mom I don’t know where to begin with this letter  I wish I could really say these things to you and know that you will listen and actually care  actually take the time to admit some faults and choose to change yourself for the better  All my life I’ve loved you more than is probably healthy  I spent the better part of my childhood adolescence worrying about you  I don’t remember a time in my life that you have ever been truly happy  and to this day  it hurts me a lot  I wish that you cared about your happiness in the same way that I care about it  From the time I can remember as a little kid  you were always so stressed out and upset  every day  A lot of how you felt rubbed off on me  I can remember growing up how I always would frantically clean the house before you got home  fluff the pillows on the couches  dump the ashtrays in the trash  wipe the coffee table  counters  and kitchen table off  Make sure sis and I’s room was clean  I remember thinking maybe if everything was “perfect” that it would somehow change your mood  because I knew how important having a clean house was to you  Now  I have to have a clean house in order to feel secure and comfortable Do you remember when I was  years old  and you found out that sis and I had ‘seen’ cousin B’s penis from Aunt M and dad  Do you know how scary it was when you came home and got angry with us  acted as if whatever we had gone through was just one more stress added to your plate  You didn’t even ask us if we were okay  You just said “well  I guess you’ll have to stay with your Aunt M tonight while I go to darts ” And then I said no  mommy  it will be okay  Cousin B won’t hurt us  and told you that we didn’t want to go to Aunt M or dads  And instead of being a reasonable adult  you listened to me  your child  the  year old who didn’t even know that what was happening to her was wrong  Did you know that because of that  I carried that with me for the rest of my life  thinking that it was my fault that you got in trouble with DHS the first time  and it was my fault that the family was never the same The day that littler sis’s dad called the police because of what she said about cousin B  I remember coming home from school to you frantically running around  packing our stuff up  You had always treated me like a little adult  but I feel that from this day forward I was never a child again  You didn’t tell me what littler sis said  but you told me enough  That we had to get out right now  that you didn’t have the money to get us out  but it wasn’t an option  that we were losing littler sis  I helped you pack our things as you fell apart  That wasn’t the first time I saw that  as several months before that you broke down to me about G leaving you for your best friend  who was like an aunt to sis  littler sis  and I  I worried about you  As an  year old child  I worried about you  So much  When we moved into the duplex and had to do supervised visits with G and T  ex best friend  to see littler sis  it hurt me too  I know it hurt you horribly  and I am so sorry that you had to go through that  But I was there too  I was with you  I felt not only your pain  but I felt my own  I felt the loss of two adults in my life who I did love  I felt the loss of my baby sister too In that time  I remember that grandma and grandpa had given me a disposable camera to take pictures with my friends  So  I took it to school and took pictures with my friends  Veering more towards   years old at that point  L and I had taken pictures of each other in some awkward  laying down pose in the tunnels in the playground at school  I don’t know how the camera ended up at L’s house  probably because her mom would babysit us a lot  Do you remember  You came home one day  mad at me  crying and yelling at me  you pulled out those pictures of us laying down in the tunnel and told me that you were disgusted with me  You said that we were trying to be “sexy”  You made fun of us  and told me how gross that was  In that same conversation  you pulled out pages from my diary  This part is still weird to me  because I remember you saying that I had given the pages to L and told her to hide them so that you wouldn’t see them  I don’t remember doing that  but at the same time  I don’t really remember writing the pages either  Anyway  in those pages  I had written that I hated you  I remember you focusing hard on that  making me feel guilty for writing such a thing  Saying that I was ungrateful and unkind and asking me how could I do such a thing  And I remember feeling like the worst kid ever  I felt ungrateful  unkind  and dirty During that time I also started having what I now know is PTSD  I couldn’t sleep at night  You dated a bit  but even when you weren’t dating  and nobody was there but you  I would lay awake hearing pornography sounds blaring like a loudspeaker in my ears  Cousin B made me watch porn  Sometimes he would put it on and sit me in his lap and touch me and kiss me like I was his girlfriend or something  And as a kid  I thought that the sounds were of women in pain  I didn’t understand sex  I thought when you were having sex that you were being hurt  You were always very loud when you had sex when I was growing up  but I know now that I don’t think I was always really hearing you  the sounds were in my head  I remember waking you up night after night after night  As a child  I didn’t know how to communicate to you what was happening to me  I would just cry and say I couldn’t sleep  You would be annoyed  get up  give me Benadryl  again and again  and tell me to go back to bed  I remember wanting so badly for you to just hold me and comfort me  but you never did  and I didn’t know how to ask you for it After getting littler sis back you were dating a guy for a while  I walked in on you and him having sex one night when I was having one of my episodes  You got angry and yelled at me to go back to my room  and don’t come in your room without knocking  which had never been a rule in our household before  The next day you asked me what was going on  why I wasn’t sleeping  I wish I could remember what my tiny voice said to you  All I know is that I must have kind of communicated what was wrong  but not well enough  You had the guy sleep in the living room for a couple of weeks and I did sleep better  I remember you mentioning taking me to see a counselor  And I was okay with that  I wanted the help  But then  after a couple of weeks  the guy was back in your bed  And when I tried to talk to you about it  you basically said “get over it  he’s my boyfriend  we’re going to sleep in the same bed ” At some point  I recognized that my “episodes” were so much of a bother to you  that I stopped even going to you for help  I just continued having horrible sleep because of these horrible symptoms  The sound of sex in my ears  which to me equated to pain  My heartrate up to intense levels  sweating  dizziness  to the point of feeling like I might throw up  Horrible anxiety  Feeling extremely frightened  Not sleeping even effected my school life  I had always been a straight A student  and during my th grade year when we were going through this  I started “daydreaming” the teachers would call it  My grades started slipping because I stopped paying attention  I would say it’s really the furthest thing from day dreaming  It was more like awake nightmares Once we moved to the house  the next thing that I remember vividly is that I was laying on the couch watching TV  and I put my hand in my pants  I know now that that wouldn’t be socially acceptable to do while laying on the couch with people around  but I was a kid  And instead of asking me to do that in private  you snapped on me  you told me that I was disgusting and said to not do that  You made me get up and wash my hands  In that moment  you made me feel like I was dirty  AGAIN  As a CHILD  The PTSD symptoms continued throughout all of my teenage years when living with you  though only when you had a man sleeping in your room  I used the tv to distract myself  but you and your mother were against the TV being on for more than the set hour at bedtime  If I got caught turning it back on  I would get in trouble  Once I got a cell phone  I would then use that to distract myself by getting on social media or texting people  Before too long  you caught on to that too  and would take my phone at night  Now I realize that both the tv not being on and not using my cell phone are reasonable things for a parent to do with a typical child  But I wasn’t typical  I had mental health issues that were being denied all over the place Do you remember when I was  ish  and sis and I got into a fight  and she said that she hated me  My reaction as a CHILD was to go to the bathroom and to try to take as many Ibuprofen as I could swallow  Sis followed me to the bathroom and started freaking out  You came in  and your reaction  AS USUAL was to get angry with me  you yelled at me and said I was being attention seeking  and to never do that shit again  You shamed me  then sent me to bed  No concern came from you  You didn’t think  wow  my kid has got some problems  maybe I should get her some help    When I was  you had your “sex talk” with me which basically was you saying that as a teenager  my having sex was inevitable because that’s what teenagers do  and that you didn’t want me to get pregnant  so when I was in a relationship that I would need to be on birth control  So when I was   and with A  you took me to get the DEPO shot After being with A for several months  he was pressuring me to have sex with him  I remember feeling like I didn’t really want to  because I didn’t really like the way it made me feel  it brought back my PTSD issues  I tried to talk to you again about what happened to me  I told you that I needed your help  Your reaction was to say “I don’t want to hear this” and to walk away from me  I really needed you there  mom  I needed you to tell me that if I wasn’t ready  if I needed to see a counselor first to be sure that I knew what I was getting into  but you didn’t  you chose to avoid my truth for your own benefit  And so I did have sex with A  No  it wasn’t painful  but it wasn’t enjoyable either  I didn’t necessarily want to  it didn’t “feel good”  I did it because I thought that was just what you’re supposed to do when you’re in a relationship with someone  I thought that the feelings I was having about myself and the sexual encounters were just “normal” girl feelings  And I carried that same expectation about sex through every relationship that I had after that until I got with my current boyfriend and started going to therapy When I was   and cousin B sent me a message saying that he was in love with me and had always been in love with me  after also apologizing for what he did to me so many times over Facebook message  I felt really freaked out and also had a feeling of “she’ll finally have to believe me”… and you did  finally believe me  you took it into your own hands  made it about you  You messaged cousin B and stirred shit up in the family  which a part of me felt relieved about because you finally believed me  but then another part of me felt and still feels that you made it all about yourself  You finally helped find me a counselor  who ended up damaging the way I viewed reaching out for help for a long time  And when I decided to stop going  you were more than happy with my decision  When I got on medication for my mental health  you guilted me into stopping taking it even though I felt that it was helping me  You said that you didn’t like the person that it was making me  and I listened  because I cared about how I made you feel  You told me that if I reported cousin B that you wouldn’t forgive me  because he’s our family and that it would tear our family apart  I’m not saying I ever would have wanted to  but the fact that you couldn’t even support me  your own child  because in your eyes our so called “family” is more important than what I had been through  that is just really messed up You pushed me to make things right with him a few years later  and so I did show up to a couple of things that him and his wife were at when they came to town to appease you and other family members  even though it made me uncomfortable  You didn’t care about how uncomfortable it made me  when sis was uncomfortable about doing a family picture one of the last times that he came to town  I shouldered the blame for that because I knew that she needed what I always needed from you  Protection  someone safe to trust  someone who wouldn’t blab her feelings to every family member that she saw  And I know that to this day you and your sisters judge me for that  even though it wasn’t for me  it was for my sister  and I would do it AGAIN and AGAIN  no matter what  because I would stand by her no matter what she chose to do about what happened to her  THAT is what family does  Not lie and deny and avoid because it makes others more comfortable Since I’ve started therapy  my life has improved so much  It’s been a slow and steady improvement that I am really proud of  even if I still have my major moments of doubt about myself and what I am doing  I wish that you could be proud of me  I wish that you could see where I started  and where I’ve gotten  but it feels like all that you can see is that I’m harder to manipulate and that is too difficult for you  For all the times that you yelled at me for being depressed and belittled me for having feelings that I couldn’t explain or control  fuck you  mom  For all of the times that I needed you to be there for me  but instead you were cold  indifferent  and pushed me away  FUCK YOU  For all of the times that I let my depression take over and you called me lazy  fuck you  For all of the moments that I admitted that I was sick  that I wanted to die  and you didn’t do anything to help me  FUCK YOU  Fuck you for not believing me when I knew that there was something wrong  Fuck you for saying that I’m attention seeking  or that I’m selfish  All I ever cared about was everyone else’s feelings  You made me think that there was just something wrong with me  and because of that  I dated and sought out friendships with people who also didn’t really like me for me  but I thought that it was normal  because of course  if someone didn’t really like me  or thought I was “too much  too sensitive  overly emotional” it was reasonable  I’d been told that my whole life  I really believed  I MUST be the problem  there’s no way that it’s anyone else’s fault  And then you would make me feel even more stupid for choosing to be around people who treated me that way  not recognizing where I learned to deal with that sort of behavior You always make my feelings about yourself  why  When I was sad as a kid or teenager  and couldn’t explain EXACTLY what was wrong you would literally YELL at me and ask why you’re so horrible  The last time that I tried to reach out to you will be the last time that I ever do  When I have a baby  I don’t want you to be there  When I go through a loss  you would be the last person I would call  When my heart is broken  or I need a place to live  I won’t reach out to you  When I graduate with my degrees  I don’t want you there  You couldn’t support me when I needed you to  and you always make my successes about yourself  as if any part of how you raised me is why I am the way that I am today  And it’s not  I’m who I am because of what you and others have put me through in my life  not because of how good of a mother that you are  I was raped by a guy that I really liked  but I couldn’t even tell you  Not only because of how you had always responded to me in the past  but also so as not to confirm you racial hatred  He was the only black man I ever tried to date  and I didn’t want you to be “right” about your horrible nasty racist beliefs  When my best friend died and I had nowhere to go  you charged me RENT  You told me after a couple of months that “it’s been long enough  you need to get over it already ”          WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU  Why can’t you have an ounce of empathy for anyone outside of yourself  How could you hurt me so much  I’m your flesh and blood  your daughter  How is choosing denial better than choosing to be close to me  how is avoidance the answer to everything in your life  I know now that you will never be the mom that I thought you could be  because you choose yourself above all else  and I’m sorry for that I’m sorry that you won’t get to know the amazing woman that I am choosing and working to become  I deserved better  even if you gave your “best”  and both of those things can coexist  you’re just not emotionally mature enough to understand that  I’m sorry that you had a hard life  but that does not discount the fact that I have too  Not everything is about you  I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the daughter that you want me to be  just as much as you’ll never be the mother that I want and need you to be  You’re welcome for being there for you when I was too young to understand that it wasn’t my job  I know you think that I am abandoning you because I stopped being there for you at a certain point  And I’m sorry for that too  Because of you  I know how emotional abandonment feels  and it hurts like a motherfucker  Nobody deserves to feel that way  But no child should be responsible for their parents pain  Thank you for working your ass off to provide for me and making sure that I didn’t turn out to be a fuck up  I know that you tried  I just wish that you could try harder now to heal us I love you mom  please know that  I’ll never stop loving you and wishing that we could have a better relationship  But I’ll never be naïve enough to believe that it can happen  They say time heals everything  but I don’t know if there is healing from this sort of pain  I hope that I can forgive you for my own well being  but I’ll say that it may be the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do Well wishes Your daughter,18690,3687

881,p6gmaz,0,6,Took my hope  made me suicidal and laughed through all of it  When I was younger I told my step mom that I wanted to write a book about the extreme abuse I went through from my dad cuz I wanted to give other abuse victims hope and I always wished I had at least something like a book in my life that I could relate too She immediately laughed at me because  others had it worse  and she grew up poor and went through even worse things  and I dont even know what pain is She thinks that all my dad did was right  but I always fantasised about having a step mom that would defend and protect me from him so I trusted her   I cried my eyes out in front of her and she laughed at how pathetic I am  Today she was angry because I didnt want to listen what she had to say about my self harm   Usually its   youre stupid  just kill yourself I you really want to  I want to rip my eyes and ears from my body  I cant take this anymore  This life is a nightmare,966,190

883,p6gbze,0,11,Can Having a N Parent who is obviously verbally abusive give the child Aspergers Autism Spectrum Like Symptoms  Hello everyone  I was just thinking  Could a sheltered child or one that comes from a relative who gives them a life where they are unsure what to do half the time  give off symptoms similar  I knew someone who was diagnosed with Aspergers but had a horrible home life where they were sheltered  couldnt go on dates often or had to be watched so often and stay at home  except maybe sports  but are much better now even though they are still at home Basically  this person gets yelled at for    damned if you do something  damned if you dont  They could get along with people fine but the n parent did not want this at all  They had a social life but it was off so the parent decided to get them tested and claimed they were horrible on tests and hated specific fabrics and certain lights and all of this  And it was untrue  And now they are marked with Aspergers for life even though it is mainly on school records even now when its been a few years since graduation  Im not even sure if the n parent wants them on disability or not  but I know it is coming  I believe that Aspergers like symptoms since toddler days are due to the n parent  It messed with the brain somehow on learning about the world around them  They are a beautiful person once they are away from the n parent  They dont have Aspergers or anything autistic  its just horrible n parenting  They have a great social life  they can get a job  there is nothing stopping them from accomplishing their dreams  But the n parent holds them back and wants them as disabled as possible  Though real Aspergers people can just as well be beautiful in the world as well and function like everyone else  but I hope all of you get what I mean What is your opinion everyone  I hope you all are having a wonderful night     Thank you for reading,1933,345
884,p6g9uv,0,5,Its like constantly having a shadow following you every moment of your life  My parents are not just abusive and neglectful  They are from a lower middle class background and are generally poor  My mother on top of that is also greedy and penny pinching  for her its all about the money  To explain the extent of this  now that Im an adult I still have huge problems spending money  earned by myself  on even a candy bar  as a non essential expense  to the point of feeling so much guilt that I could literally cry  Arrogant  ill mannered  opinionated  bumptious  selfish  immature people who  would have liked to  but never  could  I brought myself up on my own  mainly through novels that helped me survive  As a result  today Im a severely unstable  depressed adult with a lot of problems  but from a human standpoint I remain far better than my parents  As a result  Ive also approached much better environments than the one I come from My fiancé is a polite  educated person from a upper middle class family  His family members are doctors  lawyers  journalists  all with advanced degrees  all well educated  high achieving  with beautiful homes  lives  pasts and futures And then    there I am  I have serious problems with having proper posture at the dinner table  keeping my elbows down  looking people in the eyes when they talk  I keep hearing my mother tell me how mediocre I am  I cant figure out how to properly relate to his family at dinner because I have never had dinner with both of my parents at the table  and certainly not conversing  at most we argue with the TV on at a crazy volume   I cant say anything about my family  because any smallest hint of what they are really like is met with horror by them  No  my parents did not want any more children  No  my parents are not capable of caring for animals  No  my parents dont go on vacations  they never paid me anything  they dont     they dont  parent  at all These are not things I can say  these are not things I  want  to say  but I think its written all over my face  I definitely hear these things constantly ringing in my head as I realize how my fiancé and I come from completely different worlds  He and his parents   talk    His parents actively   encourage   him  His parents are   interested   in his life  His parents act like parents should act  and I feel so much like a fish out of water  amp  xB Maybe I should just crawl back  and look for someone whose life is as mediocre and sad as mine,2509,439
885,p6g9mn,0,9,My Mom mailed me a letter pretending to be our neighborhood HOA saying my dad  who died last year and left me his house  would not appreciate how many weeds are in my yard I just need to vent about this somewhere  Ive had the letter for two weeks now and the more I think about it the angrier I am  I doubt there will ever be any evidence to actually link my n Mom to the letter and even if I could somehow prove she did this  it would be pointless to confront her because shed never admit to it  But Im so angry and I  know  it was her  It was far too personal and hurtful for me to believe anyone else could have sent it  I also just went NC with her a little over a month ago and shes been very antagonistic since  Shes been trashing me to other family members  trying to call my boyfriend while hes at work to complain Ive blocked her number  and twice Ive come home to her sitting in her car in front my house So  for background   last year when I was  my dad  divorced from my mom for the past   years  passed away from covid and left me his house  I moved into it at the end of  and still live there now  My mom has not been coping well with my dads death and has been very unkind and unsympathetic since he passed  Ive been withdrawing from her over the past year as a result  which has been making her push at my boundaries more and thats why I recently had to go NC  This was the content of letter I received    And heres a photo of it  https   i imgur com bpvMUs jpg   amp  xB  gt Dear Natalie    gt    gt Please try to keep the front of your property a little more presentable   it is an eyesore and the block is sure that your father would want it that way    gt    gt Stay safe    My Neighborhood  Property Association amp  xB What the fuck  Really what the fuck  WHO SENDS THAT TO SOMEONE   There is no way to read this and not feel that whoever wrote it wanted to personally hurt my feelings  Why even MENTION my dad  No reason other than to make this as low a blow as possible  Why call my yard  an eyesore  instead of citing a fucking community guideline about yard maitnence  I found the phone number for the HOA and left them a message to confirm they didnt send it  but they havent called me back  I know HOAs have rightfully earned their bad reputations but I just really dont believe they did this  First off  theyre called the   My Neighborhood  Property     Owners     Association  not the   My Neighborhood  Property Association   Youd at least think theyd get their own name right when signing a letter they sent   And while its not unheard of for people in my neighborhood to send letters  from the HOA  to their neighbors about petty shit  the older people around here like to get wild sometimes  I just cannot imagine WHO out of my neighbors would send me something so personal and hurtful  Im not saying I wouldnt put it past a neighbor to send a letter to someone and pretend its from the HOA to avoid confrontation but like    this letter is TOO PERSONAL for a fucking random neighbor to send me  This letter was typed up with the only intent being to cause upset  If I had a neighbor that was really so pressed about my front yard youd think they would at least include the names of one or two landscaping companies  I dont really talk to people on my street  Im not rude but Im not going out of my way to be friendly  Who could possibly have so much beef with me after waving hello to each other every few weeks for the past eight months   I just cannot bring myself to believe someone who is nearly a stranger to me would send me something like that  Why would this be anyones first response to weeds    Also  the letter was addressed to me directly with no return address and whoever had sent it went through the trouble of typing my name  amp  address up on a separate piece of computer paper  printing it  cutting it out and using clear tape to attach it to the envelope to avoid handwriting anything  I definitely wouldnt recognize the handwriting of anyone who lives near me but Im sure I could recognize my moms Im just so upset  Every day I think about it I get even more angry  I keep thinking about what my mom intended for me to feel when getting that letter  Because if her plan worked correctly then I would think the way my house looked was something people on the block were talking a lot about  complaining about  to each other and at community meetings  I would think that the everyone in the community thats part of the HOA talked about me and my house at a meeting and decided to send me a really cruel letter  That would make anyone feel alienated and alone and ashamed and hurt  And I really did feel this way when I first read it  Thats really how my mom decided I deserved to feel because I havent been talking to her  Ive just had one of the worst years of my life  Im adjusting to so many new things its making my head spin and Im still grieving the loss of my dad  Why be so unbelievably cruel to your only kid  My mom has always been a narcissist and I usually dont expect much from her but Im so shocked she did this,5163,960
886,p6g7wz,0,2,Ive had enough Ive had about  arguments  in the last two months  with my mother about how it is unacceptable to emotionally abuse me  She tried to deny it  Then said to get over it including the stuff she said when I was younger  She wasnt physical a lot when I was younger tbh She was rageful when I was younger and went a bit too far with the physical punishment  when she did hit me   Im in my late teens now  not a legal adult   Sometimes she threatens to punch me in my teeth because I get an attitude with her  I told her today that Im not scared anymore and if she hits with too much force then Ill hit back  She said shell  pumble  me if I hit back and I suspect shell beat me terribly  I dont know when this would happen  I suspect when I tell her to not be mean  actually verbally mean and not dramatised  because Im done tolerating her disrespect  Shell threaten me  punch me  and itll be a brawl  Im going back to school in a couple of days and boy am I excited  Should I tell my counselor bc Im getting worried for my safety  What do I even do,1073,210

893,p6fmgo,0,5,Nmom Might Sabotage My Wedding  This is my first time posting on this subreddit  so I apologize if there are any format issues Im not complying with Ive been raised as a single child by my NMom together with her equally narcissistic sister  my aunt  Their favorite weapon of choice is the silent treatment  where they would go weeks without speaking to me at most was a year or so  It even went to a point where they installed a doorbell in my room and just ring me down for dinner because they refused to speak to me  Anything could trigger this  could be me being loud in the mall  or me not getting good grades  I honestly dont know and for fear of triggering this  I would mostly just spend my time in my room playing RPGs and avoiding a social life They are Chinese  so they often talk in that language knowing full well that I cant understand  but I understand enough that most of the time  they just talk crap behind other people or myself reveling in any bad news befallen to other people Because of this  I would often have intense bouts of rage and I overcompensated with having a bombastic  inflated personality where I needed to be heard and recognized outside my home  Outside at school  I was an extroverted  social person  but indoors I was a recluse in my own home  I sought validation and emotional support from anywhere I could get  It wasnt long till I found myself getting that attention from my juvenile bros  joining a gang  and generally fucking up my life by not going to classes and playing DotA in net cafes   In those places  I actually was somebody  they knew me  and they listened  One night  I lost it one night because my mom refused to give me an allowance because she said I was going to use it to do drugs  I wasnt   It particularly bothered me because that night was one night where I legitimately wanted to go out with another group who invented me to a study session  I begged and pleaded for just enough for fare and a coffee or something  She wouldnt and I couldnt understand why  I tried reasoning with them  saying Ill be back by pm  They just ignored me  watched their TV and talked in Chinese like they usually do  In a few seconds  all of the days spent questioning my reality  having no one to talk to   having my self esteem stomped  always being blamed as a bad kid  them not having any accountability for their lack of emotional maturity  just went rushing through my head all at once and I blacked out  I started destroying the house  breaking glass threw their TV on the ground  I had it with them acknowledging my existence  I was going to be heard one way or another whether it was through violence or not Eventually  the police came and had to sort it out  My mom legitimately wanted me arrested and typical gas lighting  refused to take any accountability  and blamed it all on me and how I was a bad  bad person  She spent all her days following talking to all of my relatives about how much of a punk I was  That act of violence was the perfect evidence on how I lacked respect  and that she was the victim mother of a terrible child   I didnt care anymore  I left soon after when I was   A lot of stuffed happened in between  eventually  my Nmom and Naunt couldnt stand each other and they both left and werent speaking anymore  It took me years to reconcile my emotions  mostly with the help of my now fiance who spent many  many years untangling the sheer fucked interweb of my psyche   Because of her  I managed to somehow salvage any semblance of a relationship with me and my Nmom and Naunt and now I can talk to them civilly  and not go into a burst of rage every time  I have a stable job  good relationships  am out of trouble  and am generally a contributing member of society  Im  now  were going to be married soon  My fiance insists that they are still my parents and that they need to be in my wedding  despite my earnest objections  Ive done my best pleasing them and making sure my mom is included  I still maintain my boundaries Now  fast forward to today  there is a legitimate threat looming once again  After a point of conflict with my mother  asking her to do something for me  reach out to somebody Id be taking as a sponsor for my wedding  she told me to do it myself  I said if you can do this as a favor for me as you are more acquainted  I would be very grateful  I told her that I wanted her emotional support for this as I am really overwhelmed with all these preparations  She still tells me to do it myself  and its not her problem  Now she is ignoring my calls and messages This is bringing up some very bad memories and emotions from my past  I want to move forward but knowing her vindictive persona  there is legitimately a chance where she will to turn up for the wedding and or talk shit to my guests and bad mouth me behind me back  Im not quite sure what tod do now  I want to be a better person  but part of me just wants her gone from my life forever  but I still need her presence for my wedding  amp  xB   TL DR   Nmom giving me the silent treatment like how she used to do when I was a child  Same kind of treatment that made me go crazy  Now its all coming back at a very important time of my life  my wedding  and can seriously mess things up  I need to know what to do    amp  xB Any and all help  is welcome  Reddit,5378,997

903,p6etul,0,4,I confronted my abusive mom  but she had the grossest response  So today I confronted my abusive mother about her behaviour  I seemingly woke up with some confidence to do what previously seemed impossible  and I guess I finally felt that no relationship after telling the truth is better than a non relationship based on lies Ive read a lot of posts about confronting abusive and narcissistic parents on here so I tried to use a lot of tips  I kept it short and sweet  via WhatsApp so I can see shes read it  full of only truth and plenty of ballsy punch  I tried to expect all the possible outcomes with full awareness that the way she would respond would most likely be what I least expected  and boy was I right  She responded by thanking me for airing my grievances  and then in some weird wording  very unlike her  she went on to say how she doesnt begrudge me for the anger Ive had festering inside me for so long  But that wasnt the creepiest part  She then went on to say that she would always be there for me when I need her  and ended it with a love you xx mummy I swear to god  I almost passed out from disgust  Within that moment all of the I conflict inside my head that I previous had went away  The main reason I was conflicted when it came to my mother is half the time she was severely physically emotionally and verbally abusive  having had put me in the hospital once as a direct result of her physical wrath and later again due to sheer negligence  the doctors were surprised I wasnt dead that time   The other half of the time she was the absolute best mother you could possibly imagine  Loving  affectionate  the whole shabang  Thats what fucked me up the most about her  because I never knew which mom I was gonna get  but I knew the one I wanted existed Anyway  I guess it made me realise that anyone that can respond that way is a full blown weirdo  and the affection was probably just a manipulation  or a way for her to get her fix of love  possibly another way to feel powerful so that we rely on her or she can always have us in her lives  I actually recognise that that affection was false  all a ruse  It was absolutely the grossest thing to read  but she fell right into the trap  and I finally saw her for exactly who she really is  I finally feel free  Thank you  raisedbynarcissists redditers  This channel has been a lifeline  and now I can finally start healing properly,2434,450
904,p6etmc,0,2,Do your narcs not listen to doctors and make their sicknesses worse  I didn’t realize this was a narcissist behavior until I got to Reddit  I have a narc in my house and she thinks she knows more than the doctor  Or rather  doctors  because she went to multiple doctors thinking there was something wrong with her when there wasn’t  And got numerous tests done  I understand getting a second opinion but she went to three doctors and all they said was to go on a diet and she’d improve tremendously  But either she doesn’t listen or she makes the rest of us go on a diet and doesn’t follow it  She even refuses to get a Covid shot despite the doctors telling her it’s fine  And we’ve tried everything to convince her it’s safe  It’s actually super frustrating when we go to parties and she tells our relatives who work in healthcare that she doesn’t need a shot or that the shot is unsafe I was wondering if anybody else experienced this or they have a narc that’s that stubborn with doctors,998,182

906,p6ej3p,0,3,I learned a disturbing story about my dad a year ago and I’m still having trouble coping  A little bit of backstory  I’ve finally come to learn that my dad is a narcissist  I’ve dissected enough of my childhood to give him that label  but as a child I never knew what to call it  I know now his abuse was “covert narcissism”  and it’s been difficult to accept as I thought I had a loving  normal relationship with him  Well  for the most part  You all know very well how we’ve been taught to make excuses for our abusers and not hold them accountable for the sake of “family”  Now onto the issue at hand… Over a year ago  I learned a disturbing story about my father  The story was actually conveyed to me by my husband and it’s caused a lot of conflict with everyone all around  It also set me back a lot with my healing…  Here’s what happened My husband had drinks with my dad one night  as at one point they got along  sort of  and my dad basically admitted to being what I would say is a pedophile  The disturbing part is that he said he was asking my dad advice on raising a daughter  and my dad told him that years ago when my sister was  or   this would be his step daughter at the time when he was married to my mom and when I was still a baby  she and I have the same mom but different dads  She is  now   my sister crawled in his bed while my mom was in the shower  and started “exploring herself”  we never got a straight forward explanation as to what she did exactly  right next to him and he didn’t stop her  His explanation was that he was allowing her to be comfortable with her body and didn’t want to shame her  and this “made him feel fatherly and that he was protecting her innocence” by not stopping her  Obviously my husband was in a state of shock and made an excuse to go home  and after informing me  my husband called my mom and told her what he just found out and she had it out with him over the phone  he then made it even worse for himself by admitting that it was “hard for him to control himself when Caity  my sister  would walk around in her underwear all the time as a kid”  Since then my husband and I decided that he would never be around our daughter under any circumstances  I have connected dots and had realizations about my own childhood that have deeply disturbed me and made me question who I thought my father to be  I don’t remember any sexual abuse at all  but I do recall a few things that I now realize weren’t normal… I remember comments my dad made about my body as I was growing up  I remember him not taking me serious when I talked about men making me uncomfortable  I remember him taking pictures of women in public without their consent  I remember him offering me foot or leg massages to soothe “growing pains”  I remember him sharing sexual encounters with me with women from his past  I remember him watching porn on the family tv late at night without knowing I was aware of it… I remember feeling weird about these things growing up but I never brought them up because I thought it was normal  I just brushed it all off because he was my dad  and now I’m struggling with feelings of disgust and confusion with a man that I still somehow feel love for  He is in town and asked me to dinner with him and my brother  and for some fucked up reason I want to see him because it’s been a long time since I saw him last  he lives in another state   My husband told me he wouldn’t keep me from him but when I asked him about meeting with my dad and leaving my daughter home with him after he got off work  he said “I can’t control what you do but I don’t even know why you’d want to see him  I would feel hurt if you went”  I am not mad at my husband by any means and I don’t feel comfortable with my daughter being around my dad at all  but I am having trouble feeling love for and having good memories of someone that has exhibited and admitted to creepy  sexual tendencies with a child  If anyone has any advice on how to cope with this  please feel free to comment  I posted this in another sub but then thought I may benefit from some feedback from this sub even more  Thanks in advance ❤️,4161,809
907,p6eae1,0,29,Did anyone else have an epiphany when they realized certain little behaviours weren’t normal  For a while  I genuinely thought that all wives hated their husbands  generally speaking  fought with them all the time  talked shit about them to their children  and overall hated their spouses company  Hanging out at friends houses was downright triggering because it actually shocked me to see parents that loved each other and didn’t confide In their kids with their emotional distress  You don’t know how shocked I was to hear that the kind of fights and name calling I see wasn’t normal either  I’ve also officially learned what emotional incest is and holy crap is that an epiphany on its own  I recently shared with a friend that I feel like I barely have privacy at home because my mom tends to interrupt me and walk in on me to ask what I’m doing  Like if I’m reading a book  using headphones wathcing something or about to leave somewhere  if anyone is about to leave somewhere  she delves into some story or whole new conversation to keep them for several minutes or even up to a good hour  Imagine my shock when my friend responds with “yep  classic npd  It always has to be about the narcissist’s thing” and now I’m questioning my whole life,1252,219

909,p6e1p1,0,2,Ndad   Sounds like a pretty cushy job  Okay  for some context  I live in the middle of nowhere where you need a car to get anywhere  my parents never taught my sisters or me to drive  and they come up with a lot of reasons for me specifically not to learn to drive   I am also not allowed to have a bank account or anything like that  so my options of getting away are very limited  so I try my best to lay low My parents promised they would build my sister a tinyhome on the edge of their property as a high  school graduation present  years ago  but my ndad is too busy taking the golden child to they gym to fufill his promise  My mom then let said older sister get a dog right at the same time she was allowed to get a job  I was automatically the built in dog sitter  as I was attending university online  the only way my parents would let me  and because of that I was always at the house Here is where things get interesting  I thought I would be allowed to get a job once I graduate  as that had a always been the agreement  but  since my sister I working and still doesnt have her house  and my mom is always over at grandmas watching tv  I have been stuck with babysitting the dog all day  but this time I dont have anything like school to keep my brain from melting away  My mom said she was going to pay me   a week  from my sisters money because my mom controls all of the money in the household  for watching the dog  but she hasnt  So here I am  sitting at home alone all day with nothing to do except feel my brain slowly rot as I am not even allowed to leave the living room as that is the only room the dog is allowed in  My ndad came home  asked my sister what she did today  and she told him about work   well you get a point   he said before asking me the same question  I had to tell him that  like usual  I had to watch the dog  and he said  Sounds like a pretty cushy job  I couldnt say anything back  On one had yeah  he is an easy dog  but he would never believe me if I told him I felt like my mind and my grip on reality were melting away because  after two years of staying at home all the time for school  I thought I was going to be able to get out of the house and have a social life all for that to go down the drain for a dog Idk  maybe i am being too sensitive because when I was in middle school  while I was attending an online school because the public school teachers were bullying me  I had to say at home all of the time to raise my younger siblings and similarly had no friends and no one to talk to,2562,516
910,p6e1jr,0,2,Rants from past few weeks of built up anger   Why can’t I remember any fucking thing  I barely remember my time living with grandma and grandpa  I’ve spent most of my life there and there’s nothing but faint memories  I fucking hate It  Why am I so angry and hate people talking to me  It’s because of grandpa beating the living dog shut out of me and screaming at me for any fucking thing  And it was just the children of my mother  My younger cousin got treated like he was royalty  and he still is  He too is autistic so idk if he understands how blessed he is and I won’t hold that against him  When I got diagnosed with Autism  my grandfather mocking me gotten worse  he’s said my brain is fried up like fish and pull my hair and said how my hair twisted up looks ugly  he is half Korean and had very wavy hair   whenever I was clearly sick he’d tell me to shut up and lock me in the dark in my room  when I was younger I would occasionally piss the bed  I had to get out and tell my grandma  In order to stop me from doing that my grandpa got a rope and tied my ankle to the head of the bead  That’s not even the worse of it  he’s let my siblings and uncle do some terrible things to me  not even my grandma would stop them  CPS was contacted twice  once through my mom and the other when I written a letter to my substitute teacher in third grade  When my family lied to that dumbass agent who clearly didn’t like me  they told me that if I told my feelings I’d never see any of them again  My brother told me “feelings are for white people” and to suck it all up  I don’t understand  so much more happened throughout my childhood why don’t I remember  I remember some things so vividly but other memories are so faint  I always assumed it was because I was darker compared to everyone else in my family    What does sibling love even feel like  My brothers hate me and just as much as I hate them  They’re both against me and it’s just me  the middle child and only girl in this fucked up family with my problems always being invalidated  Since everyone had a worse childhood than me  Maybe they’re right idk  Maybe I should act like I don’t have any problems in life  Oh wait I’ve been doing that all my life an and now I have everyone deep down  Damn I wish I had a job I’m tired of family    I tell myself bad things about my dad so I can stop expecting good things out of him  I know  I know I tried my very best not to fit into that average black kid stereotype but tough shit for me I fit in perfectly with it  The next generation of baby mamas with every daddy issue out there  I don’t see myself with my ideal future  I probably said this before but I blame my dad for everything that went wrong in my life so to hell with him     Does he try  Probably not probably whenever I call him he gives me every excuse in the book just to shut me up for the next couple of months  He broke mamas heart  she soon found out she had MS soon after and became suicidal  He left her like this and pretended not to notice  Honestly half of my family is telling me to have nothing to do with him and the other half is to have a relationship  I’m torn between the two because I don’t want to fill the stereotype of the average black kid not having a dad  On the other hand I don’t want to end up like my older brother   heart broken  cold  angry and disappointed  Damn that lying man  Every time we call it’s a whole new “promise” saying “I’ll send you money” or “I’ll come visit you” mf can’t even come see me in person  he sent Stephon  my half brother  or his wife and daughter to do it  I hate my fucking life and I feel like having a relationship with both my parents would make it right  I feel like that’s how I would’ve had a normal life and I feel like I’ll forever blame my dad for all my problems no matter what he says or do  You know what who cares  He has his own family  grown ass children that he relies on to take care of me including his own wife  so let me not  I’ve always been a burden to everyone throughout my life so why not make it easier for some people  Asswipe of a father  Why have kids if you not gonna take care of them  mans was living a double life  TWICE      I want to form a good relationship with my stepdad but even though he’s known me more than I ever known he was my stepdad he’s always been a stranger to me  he’s just…been there  I recall when I was younger I always wanted him to pick me up from school  I’m glad he knew his place though and never decided to lay hands on someone else’s child but that’s odd to me  No I don’t want him to beat me but does he even consider me family  Not just family but family family and not just another mouth he feels the need to feed  What is there to even talk about between us  To him I’m just that American kid that lacks “common sense” and I think that’s all I’ll ever be in the eyes of a man  A vulnerable girl that doesn’t think and can only be used for working around the house  Anyways THE CULTURE BARRIER IS MAD ANNOYING   Let me just describe him in my viewpoint He’s a pathetic but smart man  Whenever he’s in the wrong he finds a way to pin it on someone else  he’s a pathetic child that throws a tantrum when things don’t go his way  and he get overly aggressive when someone says otherwise with him  honestly bro why are you yelling I’m right here trying to have a decent conversation with you  JUST BECAUSE IM ONLY  DOESNT MEAN I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING  Hell  one time I told him children don’t fix marriages and he told me to shut up I don’t know anything about relationships  Firstly where do you think o got that quote from  Far from beyond my ass  I heard it from people who thought the same thing you did and learned the hard way it was false  Thought I’m assuming that’s why you had Joshua which is very sad in my opinion if that’s the case  you already abuse the boy enough physically   Also how is this man able to go to college and fully study the things that he studies without taking child psychology   If he did take it it would literally save my half brother’s ass and him the constant frustration do the both of you a favor before he ends up like Jaden  hating the absolute dog shit out of his own father,6225,1228

914,p6dtqi,0,7,Feeling guilty going NC through loss My grandpa passed away yesterday and I requested to stay out of group messages with my sibling and cousins  I can’t help feeling guilty that I’m not there for my nparents who I’ve been NC with  But I don’t think being there and reestablishing contact would be healthy for me Am I a bad person for holding my boundaries through loss  Logical thinking is telling me it’s okay and if a friend were in this position  I would advise them to maintain distance    But I still feel so guilty and just need to hear if from people who get it,573,105
915,p6dkgt,0,2,NMom is acting like a toddler because my sister enforced her boundaries   Rant Vent  TW  Mentions of Suicide Attempt So the background  My sister Elisabeth and her best friend from school went to two different but close universities  Her friend  who has been through a lot with her own NDad  wasnt coping well at the beginning of this academic year  didnt tell anyone how bad things were getting for her and tried to kill herself  She damn near did too  Thank God for her flatmates finding her in time Naturally Elisabeth was extremely distressed by this and now that her friend has got the help she needs and is doing better it isnt something that she likes to talk about  Elisabeth is currently visiting the rents during her summer break from university  Im two hundred miles away at home and shes telling me this via WhatsApp Yesterday Elisabeth had been out with that friend and NMom picked her up to take her back  During the car journey she decides its the perfect time to speculate about why Elisabeths friend tried to kill herself  Naturally my sister became increasingly upset by this  This annoyed NMom who told her that  paraphrasing   like it or not Im your Mother  I can talk about whatever I want  I was really upset too because Im friends with her mother and you are so rude for not wanting to talk about this with me  She then tries to guilt trip my sister  Saying that she doesnt understand people who wont talk about their feelings and that she talks about her feelings because she cares about people Elisabeth knows shes trying to guilt her and doesnt respond  NMom eventually tries to act like it didnt happen Then today she apologises for her behaviour and then demands an apology from Elisabeth  To which Elisabeth basically says  for what  I didnt do anything   NMom then throws a massive tantrum  goes to her room to bawl and still hasnt come out seven hours later Elisabeth is now feeling guilty  My blood is boiling  I am absolutely furious and I want to apparate there and slap NMom  Failing that  I want to call my NMom and scream at her for her behaviour  I know thats an all caps Bad Idea though Needed to vent  Just when Im convincing myself that maybe she isnt that bad she pulls this crap  Lord give me strength,2281,393
916,p6dduv,0,8,Continuing to find out that my Nmom has caused me some SERIOUS health problems as I venture into adulthood Just going to list off the main issues   I had UTIs very often as a child because she wouldnt let me go to the bathroom when I needed to  They were never treated until adulthood  and I now have chronic urethral pain nearly every time I pee  even when I have no infection  I now have a life long chronic illness called Interstitial Cystitis because she wouldnt let me go to the bathroom    I had hip dysplasia as a baby and she never put me in my brace  My hips now dislocate at random times  and its very painful    I had OCD as a child and she used that to her advantage  triggering me on purpose with numerous counting games and forcing me to be anxious about pointless things because they were a trigger for me  I have minor OCD as an adult    Shes abused me to the point of having CPTSD  and many other mental issues  I dont feel the need to elaborate on this one    I had a binge eating disorder for a long time in my teen years that I could only trace back to my Nmom not feeding me for days as a child  limiting my water intake  etc  I would eat massive amounts of food when it was made clear to me that she didnt care anymore  and would end up getting sick from it all of the time My future is what I make of it  but when I start to wonder  why  Im acting out in a certain way that doesnt make sense  I can generally trace it back to my living hell of a childhood that was caused solely by her  and the enablers around her  I dont feel bad for myself anymore  but I do need to remind myself that Im not crazy at times  and then correct my previously learned trauma reaction behavior  Its a slow process,1748,336
917,p6das9,0,7,How do you avoid getting sucked into arguments that Nparents do their most to start with you  Any tips would be appreciated by not only me but anyone else who comes across this post  ♡Todays storytime in context to this question  Ive only just learnt of why its important to not let ourselves get sucked into these arguments with narcissists as we know youll never  win  any arguments  discussions or disagreements with them  Im currently practicing how to do this  but its really hard  Today tested me  I was stuck in the car with her as she was driving me back from my hospital appointment  And I was telling her about my new health flare up  I had to tell her as it changes my diet and lifestyle significantly and she tends to buy the groceries most of the time during Covid times currently  though I buy the stuff I need for myself later if I see she doesnt  In the ride back  she basically got all superior and busted out her  everything youre saying is invalid and wrong  youre stupid and young  Im right and all the reasons Im saying for why your health flared up is   correct even though Im not a doctor  card on me I couldnt help but defend myself  but then I knew the mistake I made in my head once I did say my defence  Because it fueled her sadism  it fueled her by feeding off my emotional defensive reaction  Every time I defended myself  she just snapped back with  URGH YOU ALWAYS LIKE TO ARGUE   She sounds like a rude teenager  But thats the ONLY defence she has any time I say anything EVERY time she wants to start an argument with me  Of course  she gaslights the blame onto me even though she KNOWS what shes doing  I think if I do need to respond whenever she tries to start an argument with me  I just need to either not respond  even though I want to defend myself so bad or scream at her   or Ill just respond as emotionless and little as possible  like grey rocking  Because I know if I show even a LITTLE emotion in what I say  it just feeds her for some reason  I dont get why  Its the one thing I dont get about narcissists  Because emotions are interesting reactions to them  Anyway this   mins car ride back felt like a whole hour  I realised that I wasnt going to  win  once she started to keep screaming nagging nonsense and showing off her knowledge about the reasons why my health flared up and criticising every little thing Im doing thats causing it just to try manipulate and gaslight me into believing what shes saying  It was then that I just stopped talking  I stopped talking because I knew there is literally nothing I can do or say that will convince her  a narcissist  to actually LISTEN and care about what I have to say for once  And this was whilst she was still screaming at me whilst driving  what a reckless driver  I just rolled the window down and started to do subtle deep breaths to calm myself down and bring any sliver of peace I could within that car ride    And this is why I HATE car rides with only her  She will always use it to her narcissistic advantage because she knows I cant escape  And today  I honestly did just want to jump out the car  or walk out at a stop light back home  But I held back because we still live together currently so it would be a bad idea  But wow car rides with only her are so incredibly suffocating One thing I do know for sure  Im not letting her drive me to and back from University once term starts next month  Thats like willingly diving into a pool of poison,3520,651

921,p6com4,0,3,My parents are abandoning me in my darkest of times Everything I care about was stolen from a u haul recently  All my clothes and everything  Both my parents are the type where they help me a lot financially  and I used to feel they would help me emotionally and everything  but not anymore  Right now I’m sitting in my apartment with the few things I have left and my mom isn’t answering her phone  She was supposed to take me out to eat and buy me a new desk to help me to feel better about everything  but the time has long since past  She was also supposed to meet me today to make me feel better about the recent abuse my father has been dealing to me  knowing he’s the one I always looked to as a role model before and now that’s shattered  I realized both of them must have attracted each other because they have similar toxic qualities  Anyways this is also after this past weekend where she ignored me for two days straight while in “training”  Aka drinking and touring around New York City  when I was needing to talk to her for five minutes to ask her to call the detective and also tell her the u haul workers helped themselves to some of the few belongings I had left in the truck   They got the truck back after police found it abandoned  I never thought life could get this low  How does one find purpose and meaning in life without their parents  or the knowledge they’re both evil and sick  It’s almost like they’re working together secretly to drive me over the edge  I’m not prepared or capable of dealing with this  I appreciate any words of advice,1585,295
922,p6co1c,0,13,Why were seen as  rude  by other people when we stand up for ourselves I made a sample of how a conversation with my mother went   This was within the last few years  so Id be in my late s and had been living on my own and generally had a better frame of reference for things   The one thing that struck me was that I essentially had to be  rude   by normal standards  in order to actually get anything through her head   Of course then shed huff about how I didnt have to be so rude to her all the time  amp  xB So the conversation  she was venting about some marital issues which honestly werent really my business in the first place   And it was going on just way too long  a couple hours  and I was getting stressed out to the point where I needed to stop a while ago and was having trouble not showing it  amp  xB Me  Hey  this is really starting to get to me Her  Oh  I know  this is such a stressful situation  lt keeps talking gt Me  This is a bit much  can we take a break Her  Yeah it is a lot to deal with  isnt it    lt keeps talking gt Me  Ok  this is too much  I need a break Her  Its so hard to deal with all this stuff other people are doing   Have you tried some relaxation techniques   lt keeps talking gt Me  This is too much  I need you to stop following me around talking about this Her  Geez you dont have to be so rude about it   I said wed take a break whenever you needed  you could have just asked  amp  xB If I point out that I did ask  multiple times  shell just say that I wasnt clear and I need to learn to be clearer rather than be rude   But it can be hard for outside people to understand when they only see the last part   In most normal relationships it would be rude to act like that   But also in a normal  healthy relationship the other person would have backed off with the softer request   Narcissists  and other general pushy assholes  will force you to be direct to the point that would normally be rude and then take offense and act as though that was the first thing you said,2069,389
