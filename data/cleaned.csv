0,p9em0y,1,0,From The Lights to The Darkness There was a man named John who was the Minister of Defense and he had six children and his wife was pregnant with the seventh and the time of her birth came and on the day she gave birth to the seventh her baby died while she was giving birth to him  so she broke down and she was depressed and severely sad for many months One day  she saw people adopting a child in the orphanage  so she ran to his wife and called him Elizabeth  John  I want to adopt a child from the orphanage  and I want you to come right away John  Really   Isnt the death of our baby enough for you and dont forget that we have  children and we can take care of them Elizabeth  But I want to make an orphan happy and fulfill the promise of his mother and father  and I want them to rest these poor orphans John  Its okay  Ill come to you He reached the orphanage and saw the child who wanted him  and his skin color was tan  so he was disgusted with him  John said   You only searched for this  why do you want this child   Elizabeth  I saw him and loved him  and you have nothing to do with me This child was  months old and was raised by Elizabeth and grew up to be  years old and this childs name was Raiden John decided to go camping with his family He was playing with his children the game of searching for treasure and they were all excited and happy and Raiden was watching them from afar and he was living for a moment and imagining that he was the hero who would get the treasure Suddenly he went to his brothers He said  I want to play with you and get the treasure One of his brothers  whose name is Kevin  said  If you want to play with us  you have to be the thief and we are the pirates and their destination is the thief  the liar traitor and not one of them   Raiden agreed and went looking for him or they threw stones at him and beat him with sticks and they ran away and then it rained and he was crying and in pain in the rain and after three hours his mother came out of the hut to look for him and found him wet and unconscious and she was screaming and took him to the nearest hospital The doctors treated him and he was fine  but every day he remembers that incident and dreams about it and every day he gets scared and screams and remembers the shapes of his brothers as if they were monsters that look like shadows  In a chair between the darkness with his head on the ground and thinking about the monsters around him  they were whispering to him Rayden was a hard working boy  the smartest in the whole school  and the teachers called him the Great Plan of America because he loved planning and strategies  and he was the first in his school from the age of  to   but between all the years he had no friends and he was always a shy person and did not like to talk He did not speak or utter a word to anyone  and between the years he was bullied by his brothers and friends at school So he was in high school at the age of   and he started the new year in high school  days and weeks passed  and he was in the same condition  And he was always watching her and seeing her  and everything he tried to talk to her was afraid and nervous and ran away so as not to embarrass himself  One day  a school party came and he wanted to invite her to the party  but he was nervous  but this time he was encouraged and decided to talk to her  so he went to her Raiden said   I want to invite you to the school party  and I hope youll agree   Jennifer said  Um  I really dont know  but I have no doubts  Raidens brother came and spoiled everything and said   Oh  brother  I found you  I want to talk to you about an important topic  Oh Jennifer  hello  just a minute  I want my brother on a topic   Jennifer  Its okay  take your time with him Kevin Raiden took him and his friends to the basement of the school  mocked him  tied the ropes  and locked him in the basement laughing  He untied it by chance and went looking for things and things in the basement  until he found a hammer and went to the door And he broke the door with the hammer  but he got out and ran and fled to the forests and heavy rain crying and hearing voices of whispering and laughter and heavy and terrifying sounds  And he woke up in the hospital and his mother was crying  and his father saw him from afar and smiled a malicious smile and said to his mother  Raiden  Where am I and what happened  His mother Elizabeth says  We called the police and they searched for you and found you in the woods fainting And he went home full of grudges  hatred and negative feelings And everything overwhelms him with depression  but the boy who was sitting in the dark and whispers comes to him and only wants to kill has woken up  to be continued       And this is my first story i know their alot of Spelling errors so yea,4897,950

2,p95gy5,1,0,no change for  …  so this happen today…i had just clocked in  counted my register and made sure i put the sign that says exact change   not accepting  … and  min later some lady comes wanting to pay for her   stuff in  … i told her i don’t have change for that i just clocked in and she said “what am i suppose to do then i need my detergent” so i told her she can wait a few minutes or come back while costumers give me   bills… she waited but the costumers behind her all paid in card WHICH SHE SAW  she said “can i pay now” already being rude and impatient  i replied i still don’t have change they paid in card… she goes “what am i suppose to do then” i said idk what you want me to tell you i just clocked in and don’t have change…  she’s like “that’s not my problem i don’t work here there suppose to leave you change as a company” the store i work for is so small here they are mainly in the east coast not west and then asked for my manager which told her the same thing and then called us ugly and poor manager skills   she said she’ll call corporate which i don’t care that’s how my shift went today lol,1137,228
3,p8yldr,1,25,The Serial Drink Spiller This just happened to me today  I work in a general store  I had like  minutes left on my shift  when a kid comes by and tells me that someone spilled a bottle of soda on the floor  I assumed that if he was the culprit  it was an accident  and I wasnt going to press the issue  If it wasnt him  customers suck  so that also checks out  As Im wiping it up with paper towels  he starts telling how there was also a spill in another one of our stores  I naively tell him  I think thats just a coincidence  Theres not some serial drink spiller going around   Thats when he started saying  This must happen all the time  which basically confirmed in my head that this kid spilled the soda but didnt want to admit it   Whatever   I thought   Im just going to clean this up  then my shift is done   My boss sees me cleaning up this giant puddle of soda with paper towels and tells me to just go get the mop  I go to the back  fill up the mop bucket  and then head up to the front to grab some wet floor signs  where my boss is telling this kids dad that he was told that  someone  had spilled a whole bottle of baby shampoo on the floor in a different aisle  and that he  saw  the kid pouring a different soda directly onto the floor  I had to stay an extra  minutes to clean up the extra spills he made  Fun fact  when you mop up baby shampoo  it creates so many suds and soapy foam that you have to change the mop water  because the mop water quickly becomes   foam,1507,296
4,p8qc84,1,32,This seems relevant for the time of year  Kind of specific  but this time of year really brings back some memories from my first job  I worked in a school uniform store every summer for about  years  Wasnt like working in your usual clothing store  we catered for about two dozen local schools and we had to be familiar with every item of the uniform for every one of those schools Customers didnt just come in and pick out what they wanted like in a normal clothing store  They would come in  tell us what they needed for which school and we would measure up  then go out back and bring the correct size items to try on  I dont know if this is a thing in other countries but here  when a kid starts school or moves from primary to secondary school  coming in to get their new uniform is quite a big moment  Quite often entire families would come in and theyd all fuss over the kid like they were trying on a wedding dress or something  It was quite sweet but it did put a certain amount of pressure on us to not ruin the moment  You see  the company would keep records of the most popular sizes from previous sales and theyd order more of those sizes and fewer of the really tiny or really big sizes  they also knew how many pupils were in the schools so they would base the amount of stock ordered on those numbers  And quite often the company would have a deal with the school so that theyd be the sole provider for that uniform  In other words  we only had so much  and you couldnt get it anywhere else   not saying it was the best system  but thats how it was  Every year between May and September  things would go kind of nuts  We loved the parents who would bring their kids in early  when we had full stock and plenty of time to order anything we didnt have  But   every year  without fail  there would be the parents who would leave it until a week before their kid was due to start school and come in expecting the full works  Our absolute favourites were the ones who had children who were tiny little things  or somewhat taller larger than average  So nowadays  whenever the last week or two of August rolls around  my mind goes back to being screamed at by angry parents and feeling horribly sorry for the embarrassed little kids who werent going to have uniforms on their first day at a new school   or were going to have to go in wearing a uniform  sizes too big for them  I had parents refuse to leave  I had one very angry father rip the phone out of the front desk and launch it at me  I think about the queues out of the front doors  I say a little good luck to whomever happens to be working there right now  To any parents who are ever in need of a uniform for their kid   here is my advice  dont leave it until now  because they  will not  have everything you need  and most likely will not be able to get it for you in time  no matter how much they want to  And it isnt their fault  its yours  Take your kid in May  the shop will be empty  youll get their full attention  youll get everything you need and I promise you  the staff will love you for it,3111,590
5,p8luvh,1,11,Football tackle When I was  I was a supervisor at a grocery store and we had a lot of incidents of people trying to steal things but heres one of my favourites One of the common tricks people played trying to steal things was filling up their own reusable bags and hiding it somewhere at the front end of the store so its easy for them to grab and run  Most of the lanes had chains that went across to prevent this situation but the end lane closest to the door didnt as it was a  security lane   not really sure what they expected a bunch of   year old girls to do but it is what it is    The thing about the security lane is someone ALWAYS was supposed to be on it  Im not really sure what happened but the girl I had stationed there wasnt on her lane and this guy saw his chance and took it  In comes my two favourite managers  well call them Gerry  late s  and Ken  Mid s   running after this guy at full speed  I was on a till since I was covering a break so the customer I was serving and I watch out the window as Gerry full on football tackles this man in the parking lot taking him down like  feet away from the door Thinking about it now the guy probably could have pressed charges against Gerry for assaulting him but the guy had like   worth of meat so it would probably have been more trouble than it was worth They ended up dragging this crying man into the store and making him wait for the cops to get there  it was definitely the highlight of my working experience,1512,293
6,p8lnmm,1,36,No  I dont need to hit Skip  Ill put this in my review   So I work at a pretty well known department store  does the word bullseye ring a bell   and Im ringing up guests  Its near the end of a full shift  Im exhausted but still doing my best with customer service  when an old man comes into my line  After ringing him up  I ask if hes a member of our rewards program as per protocol  He says he is  but he doesnt want to type in his phone number since it wont help him for this particular purchase  There goes   cash back but Im not about to argue  so I ask him to please hit Skip on the pad  He fumbles with his card and very matter of factly tells me he doesnt need to hit Skip and that itll skip automatically  Well  lets put him on payroll since he knows our system so well  I go ahead and hit the button for him  explaining that our system changed recently and it wont allow me to proceed with the transaction unless its given an answer about the rewards program  For some reason  this annoys him  He hems and haws and asks if all of our stores are doing this  since he was just at So And So location and they didnt make him do it   I cant speak for other stores  I only work at this one   Hey  its the truth  does he really think a cashier has the time or motivation to check the policies of other stores   Thinking back on it now this definitely went into effect at other locations since it happened a month ago when I went across the country to visit my dad   But that really ticked him off  and he informed me that wed be hearing about this in his review  Okay  bye  Seriously  what the hell did he expect me to do about it  Reprogram the system right then and there,1701,327
7,p8kk8w,1,41,Back to school and the lines are    unobservant  So  its that dreaded time of year  almost as insane as Black Friday  the time known as Back To School  The lines are long and staffing is short  The majority were scheduled for the early rush  I  on the other hand  had the fun of handling the early evening crowd  Imagine  Im on a register  there are only half the registers open  and the lines are LONG  Even self check has  people waiting  I think I have at least five in my line  but I really cant tell  Calling for more cashiers does nothing  we simply dont have any  And then I look behind me  It was a confusing and  at this point in the evening  somewhat surreal sight  There was a long line at the register behind mine  The gentleman who was first in line was about to put his things on the conveyor belt  And yet    Sir  that register isnt open  This was met with a blank stare  I pointed upward   The light is off and theres no one there  That register is closed   And with that  the whole line backed out slowly and sadly  TLDR  on our busiest night  I had to tell a crowd of people that they were lined up at an empty  closed register,1159,218

10,p7mg1k,1,0,No cream cheese filled pretzel for you  A post appeared on my Facebook feed from a woman complaining about a local convenience store She was up in arms because she called the store wanting to know if the store had cream cheese filled pretzels  The clerk responded that she had customers and she didnt have time to look  This lady went on and on about how lazy and entitled the clerk was  Every single response called her out on  her  entitlement  pointing out that clerks work alone for the late shift   Man  did she get flamed The post was removed shortly thereafter It was good to see so many people sticking up for the clerk,637,112
11,p7d1uz,1,128,You Only Closed One Minute Ago  Why Not Serve Me  A great story from a week or so ago with a customer coming into my work looking to get a new mobile phone  Key thing to understand is that our state is in lockdown so the door to the shop is always locked as per the agreement to allow us to still operate in some form  On this door we have about  different signs all stating that we cannot allow customers in store  we have a contact number they need to call to place orders and our operating times which end at pm  You cannot miss these signs  We also work with the main lights turned off Anyway  we have worked all day and I have completed all the end of day stuff that comes with retail  Closed the til  locked stock away  we all do some heavy cleaning now with COVID and everyone is just sitting around having a chat while the main manager gathers his things to lock up As Im working off a laptop I see a guy come to the door   its pm on the dot at this point  He looks inside  sees people and starts trying to wave someone over to the door  I dont move as I think surely he will see the sign and realise we are not only closed but dont allow customers to come into our store at this time  Surely enough this man continues to stand at the door  Now most people will look inside the shop then read the signs  and we see them take out their phones and either dial the number there or input it into their devices for a call later Realising this guy isnt leaving I head over to the door and the following happens Me  Hey mate  were closed  There are some contact numbers on the signs for the   sales team if you want to hit them up Customer  I need a new phone Me  Alright  as I said we are closed  Try the   sales team Customer  What time did you close Me  pm today  I know its earlier than usual but with lockdown thats the go  mate Customer  Its only   Now at this point I was floored  He showed me his current phone and stated that it was only   like this was supposed to be a great reveal and convince us to do his order  I informed him that   is in fact still after pm and we would be going home any minute  After he swore a little but he asked what else he could do  I told him I was going home but he could try that   number I suggested when he first arrived,2320,450
12,p77wo8,1,71,No  you cant leave the store without paying  The title is the slightest bit clickbaity  but its the best way to describe the situation  We have a problem at our store with people not going all the way through with their payment before they leave So theyll go to pay with card  but then on the last step they simply wont do it or will not confirm the amount  Therefore  the purchase doesnt go through  Policy is that until the amount is confirmed and your receipt is printed  whether you plan on taking the receipt or not  you CAN NOT leave the store  You have to stay there until the receipt prints  Even if the system is being fucky  even if I have to put more paper in my receipt printer  blah blah blah  No receipt  no walk away Thats where todays experience comes in  A lady  her partner  and their tween daughter walk into the store  Guy is a very nice and pleasant fellow and  after helping his lady put all the items on the counter  goes out to wait in the car I ring up the stuff  put them in a few bags and spin the thingy around for when theyre ready to grab them  Lady inserts her card  daughter grabs the bags  In the middle of the purchase  card in machine putting in her pin or whatever  the lady says  Go ahead   daughter   you can go ahead out to the car  Bells go off in my head  Ive had people walk out without confirming payment before   Happened on my first week  made me feel terrible but it all got sorted   So I turn to the girl and say  No you actually cant leave yet  hold on please   And her mom says  Yes she can  Luckily my boss was there and she explained as nicely as she could that the daughter cant leave until the receipt prints  and the lady gets all huffy  Receipt prints  girl goes out the door  I hand lady the receipt and she SNATCHES it from my hand  I tell her to have a nice day and she sarcastically says  Yeah whatever  you too  Forgive me if Im wrong but its common sense to not leave with merchandise until you have paid for it  Stay mad I guess ¯   ツ   ¯,2026,379
13,p77wm5,1,5,Collect your own damn carts This took place close to  years ago when I was a Junior in High School and living in Florida   At the time I was working evenings at a big name Grocery store that was right next to a chain drugstore   Most evenings  one of my responsibilities was to gather shopping carts from the parking lot and bring them inside the store so they wouldnt be stolen   I would generally gather the drugstores carts for them as a courtesy and put them on the sidewalk near their front door   In the year and a half that I worked there the drugstore never  and I mean NEVER  gathered their carts from the parking lot   That is  until one evening when there were more drugstore carts in the lot than my stores carts   So  I took it upon myself to ensure that the drugstore would  from then on  gather their own carts from the parking lot About a week later one of my fellow closers commented on how they hadnt seen any of the drugstore carts in the lot lately   So I said   Yeah  its amazing how persuasive I can be without saying a single word    Puzzled expression from co worker   So I explained what I did to achieve cart gathering compliance from the drugstore   The night their carts outnumbered ours I took one of their carts and and basically folded it into itself and jumped up and down on it until it was no more than a   thick layer of bent  mangled metal and then I placed it right in front of their main entrance   After that we never had to deal with any of the drugstores carts being left in the parking lot,1544,298
14,p72zkv,1,7,Order  What order   Ah glorious retail  My story takes place a few days ago  mods recommended taking time to calm down before posting  so thankyou  A cstomer came to the till asking for a refund for an online order  which she later stated that it was a repeat order and was unable to cancel herself  Online orders need to be refunded onto a card or gift card  Me is me  customer is c  Me  Pop your card in when youre ready  C  I cant  my banks been suspended Me  Awh no worries  Ill have to put it on a giftcard  C  Nope  Me  um  well I have to put it on one or the other as its an online order C  well lasy time this happened  managers here made some calls and did it on cash  Is that a new policy   Me  sorry  no  online orders need    C   interrupting me  before you carry on with that speil  they did it for me last time  Manager   was listening and hovering  unfortunately who ever did that  did it incorrectly  Online orders have to go back on card or giftcard  C  fine  walks off to the person theyre with  put it on that one I looked at my manager and they nodded  Me  Sure   Transaction goes through  C  so just to recap  you couldnt do the refund to cash  but could do it to someone elses card   Me  well  yeah because its an online    C  i dont care about that speil They walk off and im just stood there with my manager  confused and a bit shaken  I went out the back to calm myself  as I could feel a panic attack coming  I popped to the office and watched the cameras on the till to see if they come back around and pick them up     As something about the whole incident didnt feel right  After a few minutes and no activity I decided to go grab them anyway  and bring them to the warehouse  Remembering that the customer was unable to cancel the order  and that being part of their frustration  I called up customer service   cause thats what were supposed to do  try to resolve issues for customers  While on hold  I happened to notice that the dates on the parcels were for delivery  months previous  Odd  The manager quietly asked what I was up to  and I said about cancelling them Manager  good idea  Good initiative Finally got through to a rep  and enquired about the order  using the details on the parcels  Turns out they did indeed have a repeat but for some reason it didnt get shipped a few months previously    I mentioned the date of these parcels  which they found equally interesting and a little suspect  We cancelled the order  regardless  Amazing  Manager  you alright  Me  yeah  Its all cancelled  and relayed what the rep said  Manager  I agree  little suspect  I bet the customer will moan now that its cancelled  We laugh it off and I go about facing up  tidying stock etc  Huh    Theyre still in the store   there begins my internal battle of do I just keep quiet or do I let them know   to cover my own butt  so I can say that the customer was aware that its been cancelled if any issue arises   Naturally  I chose the wrong option  The conversation that follows is not exact as Ive now somewhat surpressed it  And remember    They previously told me that they  couldnt cancel the order online or by phone     Me  hey  just thought Id let you know that Ive been able to contact customer service to cancel your order  C   looks blankly  what order  Me      Um  the repeat order  C  what order  Me  the    One    We refunded  C  but i cancelled that months ago    Me  err    Well its fully cancelled now    C  so you used my details to do that Me  uh      C  i dont know why you did something that wasnt asked of you  Me  but    C  this conversation is over  Me  alright  Points to manager for foreseeing that  I was dumbfounded  What an odd reaction for something that was actually really helpful  And now thinking about it  most legit people wouldnt have blown up like they did   I absolutely know I did the correct thing  Conflict always reduces me to an anxious wreckage hah  So once again I retreated out the back  and spoke to the manager and a phew other colleagues that were there  All were confused and taken aback by such a reaction  Honestly  I cannot wait to be out of retail,4254,772
15,p72zb0,1,19,A regular doesnt remember anything I manage a vape shop and one of our regulars is a woman who has underwent multiple brain surgeries  The surgeries have left her with severe memory issues to the point where she basically cant communicate anything to you  even the simplest things  Usually her mom shops for her or they come in together  but sometimes she comes in alone and its extremely difficult to figure out what shes asking for because shell just describe it as a  thing  or give a description that doesnt really make sense  I feel really bad for her  shes so sweet and understanding when we cant understand what she wants  Her visit today really broke my heart tho  Our POS system has a feature where if you put your card into the reader  we can pull up a list of all the things youve ever purchased here with that card She was trying to describe that she needed batteries to me  but she couldnt think of the word and was saying things like  its not for the alcohol  or  its what makes it open  so I was having a very hard time figuring it out  I asked if she usually buys it when she comes  because if so she could insert her card and I could see it on the list since shes such a frequent customer  Her response was  no  Ive never been here before   I honestly wasnt sure whether I should remind her that shes a regular or if I should pretend I was mistaken  I didnt want to embarrass her or freak her out so I pretended I was mistaken We see her every couple weeks and have been for the past year or so  Thankfully her mother ended up calling her to see how she was making out and she reminded her that shes after batteries,1661,309
16,p71aef,1,0,Did you ever leave retail and then go back  This isnt a story or experience really   months ago I quit working retail and I work in manufacturing now  I work  hour shifts nearly every day  overtime is mandatory every week  Im just starting to feel very tired of the work and sometimes compare it to my old retail jobs  I feel crazy for thinking of going back to retail  I didnt hate all of my past retail jobs  some were better than others  But I make so much more money in manufacturing and no customers to deal with  But I work st shift and honestly I kind of hate working st shift  I used to work rd and I liked it more  There is no nd or rd shift at my current job  So has anyone else left retail and later decided to go back to it,749,149
17,p6xu8q,1,6,Really  sir   Not everyone in an apron knows how to use the registers   This was from last night I am a head cashier at a large box retailer   that has a policy about not wanting the HC running a registers because they cannot do that and run the floor   I still am willing to help out the best I can when the need arises Last night  we only had enough cashiers to keep SCO running   which actually are pretty nice because they only use a wireless scan gun  great for big carts of large items   like lumber I dont recall all the details  but I came up to the SCO area to notice the cashier was busy with another customer and there was one waiting with the prompt on the screen asking for intervention I scan myself in and help him out rather quickly and return the lane to SCO mode  then stand and watch the front for a moment   It wasnt busy  but one of our regulars was standing next to me when the cashier comes up to the guy I just help and we both hear this Cashier  Everything going ok Customer  No  but I already got helped   even though I stood here watching people walk past that refused to help me The regular turns to me and goes   Is it a full moon or something  people need to chill the f down   I come in theres a fight over there  and other over there  and now this guy   who doesnt understand that you all work in different departments  so not everyone walking by in an apron can sign into a register My only reply to him was this  They see me walk up out of nowhere and do it  so suddenly they expect anyone in the store to be able to   even if they are NOT trained to use the registers  and therefore do NOT have the bar code that scans them into them   You are right though  were all separate departments   If more people understood that  I wouldnt have people calling me over like a puppy to ask a question I cannot answer The regular started laughing   kind sir  you are a saint,1923,372

19,p6i6kv,1,39,But the shop is closed   I work as a cashier in a supermarket  This particular day we were closing at nine oclock  I was finished work at nine oclock  I had a queue of customers up until that time  As soon as I knew which customer was going to be my last that day  I got the attention of the next woman in the queue  Im sorry  my till is closing  To which she replied   But the shop is closed  I wasnt really sure what her point was  I forgot that maybe she didnt know some of our cashiers are rostered to work half an hour after closing time for just this exact eventuality  So I repeated myself  Im sorry  but  my  till is closing   But the shop is closed  I was really confused at this point and said  Im sorry  but Im finished work at nine   The shop closes at nine  At this point the urge to say  Well maybe you should have done your shopping earlier then   was almost irresistible so I just didnt say anything  She went to another till  where the cashier was working until half past  and bitched about me the whole way through the transaction  Worst customer service shed ever received  apparently,1128,201
20,p6a6fl,1,306,Maam  this is an express lane  Take your   order elsewhere  For some background  this happened yesterday  Im a teenage cashier working at a regional  privately owned grocery store  and this is about my th week working here  Im still kind of learning the ropes  but mostly everything is down pat So  yesterday  I got to work for a   hour shift  Not that bad  And hey  my supervisors tell me I get to be on an Express lane  hooray  The one that Im on is specifically  items or less  and that express lane sign is turned on with a separate switch from the one that turns on the sign for the number of my register  So  for the first half of my shift  Im doing just fine  Then  I get to go on a  minute break  When I get back  I sign back in to my till  put back on my light  but when my next customer comes  she has a cart with what looks like  ish items  I ask her   Hey there  is that  items or less   She looks pretty bewildered  and says   Oh  I didnt think that this was     Then  I see that my express light isnt on  Whoops  my mistake  I tell her as such  apologize and ring her up anyways  Right after I turn my express light back on  however  my next customer and her daughter come into line behind customer   and have a full cart with what must have been   worth of groceries  I ask her if she has  items or less  and she clearly doesnt  but she doesnt respond  After I finish with customer   the customer with the large order comes up  starts putting stuff on the belt  and as much as I try to explain things to her  she doesnt seem to want to listen  I know she knows the language  however  as her and her daughter are chatting it up constantly  So  here I am  cashier in the express lane  ringing up a   order for a customer who seemingly doesnt care  and who is holding up  customers who actually deserve the line behind her  When I finally finish her transaction  I tell her her total  and she pulls out a CHECKBOOK  We NEVER get checks anymore  Total waste of our customers time  Leaves without saying a word to me  I try to apologize vehemently to the customers she held up  and luckily they understood  Still  I guess this is what retail is like,2198,418
21,p5tyhf,1,12,Gotta have those hangers  To preface this  this wasn’t my personal experience  but this happened to a coworker today and it was too good not to share  We work at a popular retail chain and this is from his perspective I’m on the register and this family walks in  a father  mother  uncle  and daughter  I ring up the father for some socks and jewelry   no issues there  but its when the daughter comes up that we have a problem  The daughter was around  years old and she asked if she could keep the hanger attached to her shirt and shorts  I said  “sorry I cant do that because we keep our hangers ” To which the father replied “no no it’s okay  we always keep the hangers ” And of courseI’ve never seen these people in my life soI just keep saying “no I cant do that ”It goes on like this for about  minutes of the father and uncle saying “yes you can” or “we’ll take the hangers”  or “thank you it’s no problem ” Basically just insisting that I’ve already done something for them  Eventually they turn this into a “call your manager we’re taking these hangers ” And I try saying “no I’m not calling a manager ” this is a stupid request  Of course I didn’t actually say this is stupid  but I did say it’s not something to be argued over I sensed that  it’s gonna turn into another back and forth so I called the managerthey explained the same thing to hersaying that I was rude and refused them service of hangers    And they pulled everyone’s favorite line  “the customer is always right ” After some more banter with my manager   who’d already decided to give them the hangers as they weren’t gonna stop until they got their way  they said I should smile more  As an entertainer I did take off my mask and give them a sinister smileI was semi cosplaying  for anyone wondering  just some formal clothing that’s green and gold with a crown as a headband  They took it as endearing and went about their merry day I really didn’t mind that they took the hangers  but what kind of request is that from a store that clearly keeps their hangers,2060,377
22,p5rhx1,1,62,If you can’t hear me  take off the headphones  And PLEASE put on some PANTS  Some things to note before I begin my short story I’m a cashier at my local privately owned grocery store  During this whole pandemic thing  our store has taken steps to be as safe as possible and protect our customers as much as we can  this includes our carts being sanitized every time someone new uses them Our cart sanitation is this whole process I won’t go into  but it does involve customers lining up  and waiting for a cart to be sanitized for them before they can enter the store  This whole part is run by one employee at a time On this particular day  the guy scheduled to run cart sanitation couldn’t do half his shift due to medical reasons  So I was sent out to take over as I have been trained on it  and have a face shield assigned to me Now for my story  Being in a small town  you get to know most of your regular shoppers  both the good and the bad  But there is this one guy who comes in every other Sunday  he is the topic here This guy has many defining features about him  specifically the hard hat  construction vest  noise cancelling headphones  and he has this pink dog chew toy strapped to the front of his vest  I’ve seen his unfavourable behaviour both inside the store in the isles and checkout  and outside the store on cart sanitation On this particular Sunday  he pulls up to the store on his bicycle  recognized instantly because of the pink pool noodle tied in a knot on the back  he hops off and struts towards the doors  I wipe a cart and stick it in front of the door  He has no mask on  a usual occurrence  but today he also DID NOT HAVE PANTS ONI  or anyone else on sanitation  usually don’t stop him for his lack of mask and immediately call a manager on our mobile store phone  because we know it will do absolutely nothing if we try and intervene ourselves  But today I had to stop him before I even called the manager Our conversation went as follows Me  “sir  hey  Hey sir  Stop ” I wave my arm infront of himGuy  “WHAT WHAT DO YOU WANT    ” I gesture for him to take off his headphones but he doesn’tGuy  “WHAT DO YOU WANT IM TRYING TO SHOP    I DONT WEAR MASKS   ”Me  almost yelling “I know sir but I can’t let you in if you’re not wearing pants ”The guy then swats his hand at me  almost hitting my face shield  grabs his cart and goes into the store  I grab the phone and dial the extension for any managers phone  When the manger on shift that night picks up he barely has a chance to say “hello ” before I interrupt him Me  “yeah hey  managers name  that guy with the headphones  yeah that one  no it’s not just the mask he doesn’t have pants on today”Manager  “what  Is he just naked ”Me  “no no he has boxer briefs on  super man ones actually  but very clearly not pants or even shorts”The phone hangs up on me and not  minutes later a cop car pulls up to the entrance  The cop and his partner nod their heads at me and walk into the store  Another few minutes pass and I am able to witness the guy being escorted out the doors  I  think  he was given a ticket but I’m not too sure  and escorted to his bike Not the most amazing ending but definitely a shift I will remember for a while,3296,607
23,p5qxfy,1,11,Im just blind deaf and dumb  what do I know   So a little context is necessary  I used to work as a bagger janitor at a supermarket in the Midwestern US  and we had an overwhelmingly larger amount of elderly customers than we did younger or middle aged customers  so we got something like this happening every now and then  My store would send out ads in the local paper to let people know what sales we have  but the ads themselves were unnecessary for buying anything  since you would get the discount for just scanning your card into the thing at checkout That said  one day I was bagging for lne of our older cashiers  lets call him Jim  and this elderly gentleman gets in line and wants to buy a number of items we had on sale that day  and asks how to scan the ad he brought with him to get the discount  Im barely paying attention at first because I dont realize something funny is going on  but when I realize Jim is calling for a manager because he cant figure this out  hes new and hes up there in years himself   I start listening and asking question  telling the customer that all he needs is his store card  which the manager repeats fifteen seconds later He scans his card and pays  leaving the store with the quote  Well  Im just blind deaf and dumb  what do I know   Which went on to become a running joke between me and Jim,1354,251
24,p5p05z,1,7,No  that makes you cheap  My first time posting a full story anywhere on here   Long time lurker   Etc  etc     This will probably ramble on but I think its worth it   Its been awhile ago so some of this wont be   accurate   but its basically what happened TL DR at the bottom Before I started my current career as  That IT Guy  I worked in the wonderful world of retail   This story is from when I worked at an upscale Grocery Housewares AllThingsFancy store that was specific to the Southeast United States   Lets call it      NorthernTime This would have been      years ago during the happiest time of the year  Read Christmas  So Im sure you all know how the Christmas season works when you work retail   All hands on deck from Thanksgiving until the middle of January  at least thats how it was then    This was ALSO the only time of the year where Over Time was not only allowed it was encouraged  it wasnt corporate run at the time and they made BANK during the Holidays due in part by the implied status of gifting something from this store plus the fact that we were the only retailer in the state that offered certain items  I was a full time  Associate  in the Housewares department that had been working there for about  years at that point   Since most of the other employees were temporary teenagers that had no idea what was going on other than  put on shelf  and  sell the thing  it was up to me  the other couple of full timers  and the assistant manager to actually make decisions about what stock would be placed where TL DR  Cheap Bastard tries to game overly lenient return policy  or lack thereof  to get Christmas items at post Christmas prices   I tell him he is cheap because Im overworked and over the holidays by that point   He complains and management agrees with me,1821,328
25,p5nhvc,1,18,Somebody is going to have a very bad day  Happened this weekend  I was working the closing shift on the register  like usual  and the weather was really nice after a hot week so most everyone was in a really good mood  Except this one girl She was  to  Id guess  was browsing around for a while and finally came to the register with a  inch folding knife  no biggie  I rang it up and asked if she had found everything she needed  She asked if we sold tasers and I told her we didnt but kind of as a joke told her we had some cattle prods  She thinks for a few seconds and then asks if they would kill a person  serious as anything  I got out of a joking mood quick and told her I had no idea  she thought for a few more seconds and then asked where they were and I told her  She headed that way as I suspended the transaction and went to the next customer She must have slipped out the door while I was busy with other customers because I didnt see her after that  Im not sure what was going on in her life but I got the idea she was really pissed about something and someone was going to have a bad time of it  Ill keep an eye on the local news and let you know if she crops up,1195,243
26,p5kx33,1,13,Can you ask your supervisor  I am a european citizen and my native language is not english and because i am on my laptop and i do not have an autocorrect there probably will be wrong spelling or whatever  So this story takes place in a local grocery store and i think we are on of the only ones that are open till  h in the city   We actually have a lot of costumers coming in after  h   We still have to wear masks when we enter any kind of building or the train It was a busy day in general but i didnt have a lot of people in line when the security comes walking in and behind im two boys  At first i didnt realize them talking to me as i had other costumers but then i heard them asking for masks as they werent wearing one  The security is faster than i am and gets them a pack of masks and the costumers in line let me ring them up So we have those card devices where you can either just put the card on top and it will transfer just like that or you can insert the card but you can also swipe it at the side  The last option is basically never used because normally all cards have chips and can be used with the other to options  Not the card of the young fellow wanting to buy the mask  But the device at my register was like lose and fixed onto its holder so you wouldnt be able to swipe your card  this sentence hurt my head and i hope its understandable but i dont even know what the things with which the divce was fixed are called in my native language excuse me So i have a collegue passing by who cuts up the thing fixing the device so the young man can swipe his card  what he did and my colluege fixed the device back onto its holding   once again i hope its understandable  i go on with my life but there they are the two young man back on my register which is the only open register with the problem with the card device  The man with the card laughs and says they are back and why i fixed the device because i should have known that he wanted to enter the store and buy things  So i make sure he can swipe his card  But he also wants to buy tabacco which we have behind glass  so we have to get up and get it for the cosutmer  But turns out he doesnt want tabacco but a cartoon of cigarettes  whichis ten packs  which we dont have  I tell him we do not have those to which he replies that that cant be true and he is sure we have them and i should ask my supervisor  who clearly doenst has something better to do   I ask over my headset if we have those and as i said my supervisor says we do not have them  so they buy like five packs and some alcohol and go on  But here is the thing  They where coming over the border from another country and both didnt have their ids with them  they had someone else buy the alcohol and the cigarettes  since i couldnt check their age  and this young man also had a really weird wound on his head that was actually quite deep and looked like it should be seen by a medical professional,2964,592
27,p5h6mg,1,73,The deal is the same thing right  At my store we always have a good deal  They always change so that customers have a variety of good stuff each time they come  but it can get confusing sometimes  For example  we have buy one  get one free  buy two  get one free  and buy two  get two free  Since alot of stuff is like that most cashiers have to figure out the deals on screen since it’s automatic A sweet old lady came into my store today and was getting two sodas  Our deal was buy two get one free and we do ask if they want an extra incase they want the deal  I asked if she wanted another box  She looks at me confused and said “what do you mean  Its buy two get one free right ”  I nodded “yes would you like us to get you a third one ” She looks confused “no its buy two get one free ”  my bagger and I looked at each other confused  My bagger says “um ma’am… you buy two you get another free” the lady looked annoyed “no no I know I get one free”  “I think you may be thinking about our buy one get one free deal “ she kinda yells “NO” and She pulls out a flyer with soda labeled “Coke products  buy two  get one free” she looks at me and with the upmost confidence says “Im a math teacher  I know how this works”Huh     I felt she was confused and wouldn’t accept that you needed a third for the deal to work  I ended up giving it to her for free with manager’s approval  She leaves  The next customer behind her comes up confused after hearing our conversation I feel like I should of explained that better  but then again she felt so certain she was in the right  Just feel so confused in that conversation…,1626,317

30,p52ehm,1,3,A fun little customer service interaction The reason I am writing this is yesterday I had a customer in his late s early s walk in  He wasnt a difficult person to deal with or anything and I had him at the checkout counter in about a minute or less  Now the scanners at the place I work dont always boot right at the start of day  so they error on the first scan then take a couple seconds to get working  So I do a small joke where I lightly hit the top of the scanner to get it to work  naturally it doesnt do anything  but to someone who doesnt know it can be funny  So when I was interacting with this customer the scanner hadnt booted right  so I did the joke and after the scanner worked the man said   It must be a female This isnt someone I know or was making dark jokes with  but a complete stranger who said it with a sense of pride and enough seriousness to know he wasnt kidding I hate people,926,180
31,p51tl0,1,73,I had a literal brawl break out at the store today Its a bit of a story but bear with me  There was a woman  who Ill call customer A  that was trying to use self checkout  She didnt have enough money on her card so the purchase was declined  This frustrated her and she started screaming  First at me for some reason  then she started screaming at her son to put back his drink  He started crying and she started screaming more and threatening him Another woman  customer B  saw this and ran over to intervene  She started screaming at A not to scream at the kid and how she was humiliating him  They argued back and forth for a bit before A stormed out of the store  B got back in line  I checked her out and thought that was the end of it  Not too long later I hear a lot of noise from just outside  followed by loud screaming and crying  I run out to investigate and find A on the ground screaming with her kids also crying loudly next to her Apparently customer B came outside and just started wailing on her  She punched A in the head multiple times  pushed her into the public trash can  which was knocked over  and slammed her head into the wall  Judge from the giant bruise on her face I had no reason not to believe her  Cops and ambulance were called  apparently A has seizures and was worried the beating might set them off  While reviewing what footage we had of the incident later we do have B on camera punching A in the back of the head at least once  Another customer got her license plate and we gave that to the cops  hopefully they can find the attacker,1583,301
32,p4od5f,1,13,Follow your gut feeling  This is one of the moments that I worried and was scared   Next to old men hitting on me   I was spraying carts and using the tablet to count people as well as handing out masks  when I saw a man walk in with a bang bang weapon   I’m calling it bang bang because I don’t know if I’m allowed to say the weapon   We had to report this over the walkie talkies  About  minutes later cops showed up  This was different because usually a security guard just follows them around  But  my gut told me that the cops needed to be called and that this man didn’t have a permit or good intentions  So they called the cops even though usually we don’t  Because they believed me which made me happy  The cops then were stationed at the front of the store about every three to five checkouts and worked their was back towards electronics  We were told to stand behind this wall in case it got dangerous  We saw the man walking around hand on the weapon  Calling this into the walkies  They got the man and he had stolen multiple games and was planning to steal a PS  The man was crying as he was handcuffed and out into the cop car  He didn’t have a permit for the bang bang  This man had been planning to do anything for the ps  I realised if I hadn’t called it in the situation would have been worse  All the schools saying  see something say something really came in handy that day  I know people have the right to carry bang bang items  But we had a threat so we were told to say something this would just have a security person keep an eye on them  We didn’t confront them the only one ever confronted was this guy  This was because that was the way I profiled judged him  Unlike everyone else who owns a gun his wasn’t in a holster it was stuck in his pants  He kept trying to pull his shirt down on the side the gun was like he was hiding it  He also kept looking around and trying to avoid eye contact with employees  When he walked by his eyes stayed on the security office door  Those things had me a little worried which is why I called it in  Having a bipolar schizophrenic Mom  who becomes paranoid he was doing similar things  It was just a situation that my gut told me something was wrong  I was right to follow my gut  So always follow your gut because it might just save you or save someone else and help prevent a disaster  He also had stolen like    in stuff so it wasn’t ending well for him  This actually scared me a lot especially since we had been doing these viruses on shootings in the work place,2540,488
33,p4k6je,1,74,Customer Wont Let Bully Take All The Clearance Meat Ive worked in the meat department at grocery stores for over  years   Many years ago at one of the stores we had a policy that around  or  PM we would go through the sales case and grab any meat that was expiring the next day  and mark them all down to around   There was one regular customer we had that our clerk called  The Meat Bully    He was an older gentleman who would arrive in the early afternoon and watch us like a vulture until we brought the reduced product out to our clearance section  and then fill his shopping cart with almost everything  for some reason he never grabbed any lamb or veal    We had a number of complaints from other customers about how there was  nothing left in our reduced section  but also because  Meat Bully  would push others out of his way to get his precious cheap meat There was another regular customer   Farm Woman   an older woman who lived on a farm  who one day decided to do something about our clearance problem As I was putting reduced prices on the product  I noticed both Meat Bully and Farm Woman waiting and watching me  and giving each other the stink eye   Once I was down I brought the rack out and put the cheap meat into the sales case as fast as I could   When I was done and backed away the two of them went right at it  pushing and shoving each other  grabbing whatever meat they could and tossing it into their carts After a minute or two the clearance section was wiped out and they walked away to continue their shopping   Over an hour later Farm Woman came back and put most of what she grabbed back into the clearance display   I came up to her and asked   Is there anything wrong with this   Did you change your mind  She smiled at me and answered   Oh no  theres nothing wrong   I just didnt want  Meat Bully  to take all your cheap stuff   This way everyone else has a chance to buy some  I sighed for a moment and smiled   I appreciate the thought  maam    but then grabbed a couple of packages she had put back   As I suspected they were room temperature   I continued   But we cant sell meat thats been unrefrigerated this long   Unfortunately well have to throw this all out   Oh  Im sorry    she muttered  frowning as she realized that her good deed had been for nothing  walking away glumly Thankfully Farm Woman never tries that again   A few weeks later the company would change our clearance policy to where we didnt reduce the prices so drastically  and though Meat Bully continued shopping there he wasnt nearly as aggressive,2586,478
34,p4h11d,1,22,Try Again  This story happened a few days ago and I still get a bit of a kick out of it To set the scene  I work at a grocery store as a cashier  It’s about  PM  and we have several checkouts open at this time  Things are moving along without issue and it’s just the slog of greet  scan  pay  repeat I come to the end of another order and the customer tells me he’s paying with credit  Sounds good  I do what I need to do on my end and wait as he does his stuff  An error message appears  Not unusual  sometimes they’re actually using a debit card  sometimes they take the card out too early  However I had never seen this message before  “Try again ”That’s odd  Well we just got new registers so maybe it’s just rephrasing one of the old messages  It’s clear as day  so I inform the customer we need to try again  He’s fine with this and we proceed as usual “Try again ”Right then  let’s try again  We redo the payment yet again while the customer and I begin discussing what to do if it doesn’t work again  At this point I flag down a manager for help and they just yell over “Try again error ” Slightly annoyed It was at this point that I looked up and down the checkout to see this same scene repeated at every register  One of the customer service employees who had come out to see what was happening just started going “Oh no  Oh no no no ”The entire card processing system had gone down The poor managers  They start making phone calls while all us cashiers just have to stand around and inform our lines of what was happening  The guy I was serving didn’t have cash and the managers were a bit busy so my line was going nowhere fast  Everyone just resigned themselves to wait and see what would happen next Thankfully  they must have gotten to the right people because a few minutes later it comes down the line to try running card again  so we repeat the age old song and dance and hooray  It’s working again So definitely an anticlimactic ending  but there was definitely a scare there  I can only imagine what would have happened if we hadn’t gotten the system up again,2102,388
35,p4gy9z,1,203,Officer  he wont refund me cash for my gas   From my gas station days in     About a year into working there  my station joined in several others to switch over to pre pay only pumps  I personally would see drive offs a few times every time I worked  so I was happy to see the change  Customers  however  resisted the change as much as they could from threatening to not get gas here anymore to get me to turn on the pump for them because our system still allowed it for semi truck drivers that use special cards to pay One day  a lady I never seen before  our Karen  pulls up to the pump  and grabs the nozzle  expecting me to turn on the pump for her  I announce over the speakers the same speech Ive been giving everyone that wont read the prepay signs on the pumps  and continue to wait on other customers in my line  She ignores me at first  but hangs up the nozzle after a minute and makes her way into the store  I finish the customer between her and me and she starts in at me about not letting her get gas outside  I politely tell her were a prepay only store now  and shell have to put money into a pump before getting her gas  She seems confused at first  but we get through the transaction with her putting in   unleaded onto a debit card and she heads out to pump her fuel  She doesnt put the whole   into her vehicle  and heads back in to speak to me After I get the customers in between me and her  she wants the cash for the fuel she didnt used  Now  it my bad for forgetting to tell her gas prepays on any card are automatically refunded once the nozzle is hung back up onto the pump  I tell her this and I have no way to give her cash back from the transaction  mentioning it may take a day for the refund to appear on her bank statement  She gets mad  demanding I give her cash for the fuel  I repeat myself  apologizing for the misunderstanding and say she still has the money  its just on her card  She leaves the store  and I think Im done with her  Nope I continue on my work in between helping customers in the store for several minutes and I look  outside  A cop has pulled up to Karens car and shes talking to him  occasionally pointing at the store and I already see the headache coming  I tell my co worker to run register as the cop comes in and he asks to speak to me  I greet him and ask what he needs  He informs me that Karen called the cops  saying we were refusing to give her her money back for the fuel while being really rude to her  I tell him what happened  how refunds for gas work  and if he wishes  he can come back with me to the cameras to watch the footage   He says thats okay and hell inform her of what actually happened  I dont see the cop and lady talk as a rush hits the store then  but one of my regulars saying that lady flip me off after she got into her car so the cop wouldnt see her do it,2881,561
36,p4dziv,1,12,I have been abused  So  this is a story that mostly happened to a co worker of mine  but since I was involved as well  I thought it was worth sharing  amp  xB A couple of days ago I was working the register when a woman  her husband and their  children came up to me  The woman  lets name her Karen for no reason whatsoever  asked me where she could file a complaint because she had been abused  I explained to her that we have a front desk where they handle complaints but she didnt seem satisfied because she asked who my manager was and wanted a description of what she looked like  I told her my managers desk is at the front desk so chances were shed be over there  She asked if it was that woman she saw earlier wearing a cardigan  I had to stop myself from sarcastically replying that yes  sure  shes the one woman in this whole building wearing a cardigan  As I explained for the rd time where she should go with her complaint  as Im not qualified to deal with that  she continued yelling that she has never been treated that way  she didnt know what she did wrong and that she was completely shaken because she has been attacked by the personnel  I told her I dont know what happened and rang her up  while she was shouting at me for not even asking her loyalty card  she never gave me the chance to actually ask her inbetween her ranting   Now  after all of that  youd think that she really had the worst experience one can have while going shopping  At the time I really did not know what had happened  but I found out the next day and well    prepare for an anti climax We have a lot of students working their summer jobs at my workplace  One of the students was working at the clothing department at her desk that happened to be in an aisle  The thing about working in retail is  there often is no place to work at where you arent in the way of the customers  which usually isnt a problem because there are other ways to pass by or they could just ask like decent human beings  Karens husband walked behind the table the student was working at to look at some clothes  That student was looking at Karen  wondering if she also had to be there or was just waiting on her husband  Out of nowhere  Karen started shouting that the student was looking at her  aggressively   The student went up to my co worker  in tears  to tell her what happened  so my co worker decided to go up to the aisle to see what happened  She asked Karen if there was a problem she could help with  but she just continued shouting  saying that she had no way to pass by and that the student was purposely blocking her  My co worker calmly explained to her that there were many openings through which she could pass by  but Karen didnt believe her and her husband also got upset because of  how his wife was treated  After going to file her complaint at the front desk  Karen insisted that the assistent store manager would go to the clothing department with her to demand an explanation  She belittled my co worker  saying that she was scared to tell her employer the truth  My co worker said that she had no problem  telling her boss what happened  but not while Karen was still there  About  minutes later  she passed my register again to proudly announce that she went to complain as if I was supposed to congratulate her  I just shrugged at her and was happy to know that that woman would be the joke of the day,3436,634
37,p45cqb,1,17,Homeboy doesnt like my customer service   the Sequel  Greetings       The saga continues of Graveyard shift at the gas station  Odark thirty adventures  Thursday night  a regular customer whos been coming in for months  came in to buy his regular thing of a pack of Marble O Black cigarettes        He always buys those cigarettes  sometimes he also gets a soda  sometimes he gets a lighter but its always those cigarettes that he buys        Not Thursday  no      Thursday  he angrily marches up to the counter and starts swearing at me words that I cant post here  but censoring out the profanity he says   Hey       Youve been giving me attitude and I dont like that         Did you shut off my gas the other night          The one word I got in edgewise during this whole exchange was   Yes        Homie continued his ranting and cursing saying that that wasnt right  that he was going to report me to corporate because I   was a        amp                     gave bad customer service  and he stomped out  amp  xB What happened  amp  xB Flashback to late Monday night  Homie came to the teller window and asked for his Marble O cigarettes  as per usual   and  wanted to pay for some gas        Slipping two   dollar bills into the drawer  he said that he wanted the cigs and   bucks at pump   too         Now unfortunately  due to the thick safety glass  all I heard was that he wanted gas at the pump  so I rang up the cigarettes  then rang up the remainder of his forty     dollars  about   bucks  to pump         As I gave Homie his cigarettes through the window drawer  he asked  Wheres my change Realizing my error  I turned back to the register and tried to void the transaction before the pump turned on        That managed to stop the signal  but also caused the old register to freeze up        A few tries to get it unfrozen  failed and I had to tell Homie that all we could do was wait for the register to unf       itself        Not happy cuz he had things to do  Homie replied that hed go pump his gas and come back and get his change in a minute         Not waiting for my explanation  he took off to find out that the pump wasnt going to work  for himself Homie returned pissed off now  and just wanted his money back for the gas  saying hed go across the street       He had wanted    in gas  so I gave him back one of his    dollar bills         Wheres my change     He demanded again  so again I tried to explain that I couldnt get change out of the register because it was frozen      Now  Homie was demanding  all  of his money back          If you want it all back   then give me back the cigarettes  okay   was my reasonable reply        He was not okay with that  but wanted his money  and tossed the cigs in the drawer        To which  I returned his remaining                  Off Homie stormed to his car  and of course   thats  when the register came back to life          Ping  went the register  and Ping  went pump    which had finally been activated         What to my wondering eyes did Homie do        He tried to take the gas         He had the fueling nozzle in his hand and was about to put it in his car and BEEEP       I turned off his gas pump   Yup  Homie may not have liked my customer service  but I was  not  going to give him free gasoline,3355,749
38,p43d94,1,10,I messed up    Heyy  I’m new to my job and started just under two months ago doing two night shifts a week at a petrol station  I work alone  Anyway  I had finished a  hour hospital shift for my uni course  am    pm  and was scheduled in for work at the petrol station the same night  which I agreed to  from pm to am  I was exhausted  to say the least  I found myself making a lot of mistakes with the money and nearly giving customers too much change  they were honest and said it was too much so that wasn’t an issue   which isn’t like me at all  When printing out a voucher code for a customer the printer had an error  and for some reason it didn’t occur to me to just reprint the receipt  I just redid the transaction  This meant that the till was £ down  I feel absolutely terrible  I’m trying my hardest to manage everything and took on more than i could handle  Just wanted to vent really  it’s getting challenging to manage all of this at once,967,187
39,p3zr75,1,4,A good day for a picnic  When I was younger I worked in retail management for about  years  tons of stories to potentially share but this one is the one that I just have to share  The store where I worked was basically in between a senior living facility and a halfway house so we got all sorts of goofy clientele  One day about  weeks after being promoted to management I got to work and noticed a regular client walking around with her daughter  She had been known for being a little off so to keep an eye on her is what I was told  I couldnt believe my eyes in broad daylight while looking at toys her and her daughter sat down in the middle of the aisle and pulled out a picnic blanket and sandwiches  I was a bit shocked to say the least and was halve tempted to just let them eat  Needless to say I had to ruin their picnic and give them the boot,856,171
40,p3t64a,1,34,Youre gonna go far kid  I managed a retail store for over  years  I have a ton of things to share  This is one of those things that sticks out in my mind  We hired a lot of kids that were straight out of high school and they were usually irresponsible and didnt want to work  We hired Jack  He seemed to be one of the more hard working people we had hired in a long time  But after so long he started calling off a lot  After  write ups  it was automatic termination at our place and at this point Jack was on his last chance  He called in saying something about needing emergency surgery and we told him  ok  but make sure you bring in a note so we can excuse this  After his next shift  a note was found in the managers office  It was a green post it note  written in Jacks handwriting stating that he had been at the hospital having emergency surgery and was to be excused from his shift You can guess what happened next,932,183
41,p3j122,1,26,Something really sweet happened today  A few weeks ago we had a customer leave their credit card in my shop by accident  They phoned to check it was there  but they had already left town by that point so they asked us to send it to them  We did  registered post so we got confirmation of a signature  and disguised inside a parcel so that it wasn’t obvious what was being sent   This morning we got a parcel back  A lovely hand written thank you note with a book from my favourite author  that had come up in conversation when they were in the shop   Just a little note that I work in a very small shop that my husband and I run  so I didn’t need to check with a boss about policy or anything,699,136
42,p3fcoi,1,83,Dude just dropped and item off and walked out with another instead of doing an actual exchange At work yesterday this guy came in with an unopened deodorant and said he got the wrong one for his wife and asked if he could exchange it  I said yes of course  and he asked if he could leave the old one at the register so he could grab the correct one  Thinking nothing of it  I assumed  like any reasonable person  or so I thought  that he would grab the new one and then come to the register to complete the exchange  Wrong  His wife met him a few min later  they grabbed the new one  and just   left with it  Has this guy never shopped anywhere in his whole life  Like  ever  Thats not how you do an exchange  I tried to get their attention as they were leaving because they stopped by the door for a moment to say something to each other but as I tried to say  hey arent you doing an exchange   But they ignored me and left  and were gone before I could get a manager to the front  I could maybe understand more if it was a small boutique store or something but I work at a large chain store  so it doesnt make sense  Im still trying to wrap my mind around this one  Guy was wearing a mask but probably in his late s  kinda looked like Shaggy from Scooby Doo but with a longer beard,1294,254
43,p3d8zy,1,25,impossible customers every now and then i get a customer who is so instantly upset by something i say or do that it really seems like not having upsetting them would be impossible   for example  the other day a lady walked into the garden center where im a cashier and asked me  with a little hostility  where our peonies were   i said i wasnt sure if we had any and asked if they were perennial or annual because wed definitely not have them if they were annual   just this upset her   customers dont seem to understand that not every employee knows everything about the store and that some of their questions can only be answered by asking the right person   as a cashier  i am that wrong person to ask   i am not intimately familiar with our stock since im legit not allowed to leave my cash and dont get to see where things have been moved or added or run out of stock throughout the day week   she said they were perennial and i told her wed just gotten a shipment of perennials in so if she wanted to take a look around  shed be getting first pick   this was too much and she got nasty   well  of youre not willing to come show me what you have in stock  i dont see why i should even shop here   at that she turned around and left   just left   through the parking lot  i could hear her yelling this is the worst customer service i have ever had   unbelievable i mean    why did she even come in   i mean  thats a pretty big shift to make from fully intending to shop to leaving in outrage in like thirty seconds if she was actually intending to shop,1580,308
44,p387tl,1,35,A run for my money at an INconvenience store So back in the day I was working for an In convenience store back in the day  This place wasnt in a necessarily rough neighborhood  Ive worked much worse in the past   but there were just enough High School and College Aged kids to get real annoying real quick  This particular store has doors that lock with the push of a button behind the register  Pretty cool actually  and important detail for later  Also an important detail  my managers a genius  so they have me put a big stack of beer right by the front register  You know  so the beer run guys can see how close the beer is to the door from OUTSIDE   Curly Haired kid comes in after just walking around the parking lot for twenty minutes  and my spidey senses are tingling  I know this dude is going to Beer Run me  I just know it  He comes to my register and asks for a cigarette that happens to be very far up on the shelf  Ive had this happen before  someone asks for something thats hard to reach and when I turn my back theyre gone  Not THIS time    I then press the door lock button  which makes a very loud  clack   at the location of the door s  which was my way of letting him know that I knew what he was doing   Well  he evidently didnt notice  despite my sighs  despite my exaggerated movement towards the button  I was thinking to myself  the best person to really think to   What does this kid think Im doing   Maybe he was desperate  whatever  but as I turned around I hear a way more satisfying than anticipated THUD    as this kid  with an  pack in hand  slams into the locked doors  This kid was ON THE FLOOR  I have no idea how the pack in his hand didnt break  He then kept slamming against the door with his body  saying  Open this door  open this effing door right now     Time for some “next part of the story”I see this kid come back towards one side of the store and wind up to plow through this door  I know this kids gonna break the lock if he doesnt stop doing this      He makes one last long run at the door and then I press the unlock button last possible second  The kid flies  literally FLIES through the doors swinging open  tumbles to the ground outside  finally the  pack breaks  rolling everywhere  The kid picked up like four beers and just kept running,2323,433

46,p379ma,1,0,Worker Expects Me To Know Where To Deliver Just Based On A Name  So this happen today  And I’m glad I snapped at the coworker  Usually I’m a pretty quiet person  Whenever there’s a mistake  I don’t normally snap or get angry or anything like that  I just keep to myself  This worker  he makes mistakes all the time  And they aren’t small mistakes either  They are a big mistakes that often cost time and money  For example  this is something I’ll put in a future story  but the summary is  he put down I had to go to a certain town just over an hour away  to deliver something  when in reality  where I had to go was less than a  minute drive away   This coworker  just give you an idea  he feels like he’s a big boss  even though he’s not  When he makes a mistake  he tries to hide it  but when others make a mistake  and minor ones no where near his size of screw ups  he’ll give you crap for it   I don’t take him seriously if he gives me crap for a minor mistake I make once in a blue moon because they are nothing compared to his  Today I had a load of building materials to take to a contractor  So the bill I had  on the left side  there is the contractors name and home address  The left side is usually for account information to know who it’s being billed to  The centre column  is the ship to column and when that’s empty  you delivere to the account address  which was what this form had  The ship too column was empty  And on the right side of the form  is info  like who made the order  what the contractor wants as a PO  etc  So I drive out to the contractors home address  which was about a  minute drive  When I get there  the contractor is not there but his wife is  I told her that her husband ordered the stuff and my info said to delivered to his home address  She was confused  because she thought that order was supposed to go out to the jobsite he’s at  I phone the contractor  and he says it was supposed to come out to the jobsite  and he told me where it was  Luckily I haven’t unloaded any of the material yet  so I told him I’m on my way  So I had to drive  minutes back in the direction I just came from to get to where this contractor was  So I get the contractor his material  and I asked him “When this worker was doing the order  did you tell him it had to come to this address ” He said he told my coworker where it had to come  So when I get back to the store I was burning red  I checked with a few my yard guys  just to make sure they weren’t told something I wasn’t  But they all told me they were never told it had to come to that address that wasn’t on the order  So I go in and I see the worker  and I asked him “Did the contractor say it had to go to address B ” He told me yes  and I snapped right there  I said to him with my voice raising a little  “Why isn’t it on the order form ” He then says “I circled the name of the person ” I look in that PO field that I mentioned earlier  and I see a random person‘s name  but no other info  All it was was a name  I raise my voice more  and said to him “A name doesn’t help me  I have no idea who this guy is  Where he lives  or anything like that  Even if there was no address yet because the property was still under construction  there should be some sort of description like he’s a long road A  near intersection B  A simple little details on address can go a long way to make things a lot easier ”  My coworker said nothing  just turned back to his computer and continued his work  But my other coworkers nearby heard what I said  they all had small smiles on their faces  because they like it when they see this guy get trouble for a mistake he makes I’ll post some other stories about him in a few days  If anyone wants to hear more  let me know  and I’ll let you know when I post more on this guy  And sorry if things seem jumbled  I used voice dictation for most of this,3901,780
47,p2uhik,1,92,We Are Out of Ice  I work as a cashier in a large chain grocery store  We also sell ice  located in a large freezer near the front of the store next to the registers It was slowing down in the store and I had some return items at my till that needed to go back  We can either bring the items to customer service and they will return them to shelf  or we can go return them directly  The item I had was located in a nearby aisle so I decided to return it directly  Our large ice cooler is located at the end of this aisle  which is next to the registers  As we have been having a heat wave lately  our ice was sold out again today  As I turn up the aisle and pass the ice cooler  I hear a woman close the cooler door and comment out loud  Oh  Theres no more ice   I continue walking  return the item to shelf and as I turn around the woman is standing directly behind me  blocking my way out of the aisle and glaring daggers directly into my eyes  Me  cashier  C  customerC  Did you just IGNORE ME Me  Pardon  Did you need help with something C  Did you  Ignore  Me Me  No  not intentionally  I was retuning an item to the shelf  Sorry you had the impression I was ignoring yo C  Theres no more ice in the cooler Me  Yes  We are all sold out of ice   silence     She looks at me with a blank look and does not say anything else for seconds  seemingly unhappy with my answer Me  We dont have any more ice  We are sold out  C  Well where am I supposed to get my ice from  Me  You could try  gas station across the street   they usually have some   more silence  still glaring at me C  I came here to buy ice Me  We do not have any ice in stock at this time  C   waves her hand at me and turns to leave  Dont be so rude I really didnt think I sounded rude  and I was genuinely confused when she came up to me asking if I ignored her  She didnt address me directly at all before she confronted me  No  Hey   or  Scuse me  to get my attention   Although I did hear her say  Oh  Theres no more ice     it sounded more like an observation out loud rather than asking an employee if there was more somewhere else,2148,411
48,p2ubzx,1,23,Told customer I was a prisoner I used to work at a big box electronics store selling car stereo equipment  A decision was made only managers could open the door between the store and the install bay  Everyday customers would buy their stuff then have to wait for a manager to come open the door  So everyday I would be asked by every customer qhy dont they trust you to have a key  As a part time  for the discount  employee I usually would just shrug my shoulders  Then one day I was asked the question and for what ever reason I said maam Im hoping to earn that privilege   I went on to say I was a privileged prisoner from the local prison who was soo  to be released and was earning a place in the store back in my community upon release  The manager came and let her out to get her stuff installed  A few days later I came into work to see the district manager waiting on me  Evidently she sent an email to corporate commending them on the prison work program  Luckily I didnt really get in trouble but they were not impressed with my laughter,1053,203

53,p22djl,1,123,Customer gets mad when I don’t let her break the law…again  Earlier today  I was working my shift at a convenience store when a woman came inside  After a moment or so  she approached my register  and asked for some cigarettes in a very snotty  annoyed fashion  She swore at me when I mistakenly thought she asked for Marlboros when she really wanted Paul Malls  She also looked as trashy as her attitude  emaciated body that aged  years ahead her actual age  crooked brown teeth  and unkempt hair and clothes  I didn’t think she was trashy based on her appearance  her attitude was trashy  and her appearance happened to reflect that Anyway  after I rang up her order  I asked for ID  as was standard of our store policy  She bregrudgingly handed me her driver’s license  and when I scanned it  it came back as being expired since   I showed my supervisor  and she politely informed the lady that  by law  we couldn’t sell her any tobacco with an expired ID  My supervisor and I had then the following exchange with her  with the lady customer being snarky and bratty through it all Lady  You guys didn’t f  king card me the last time I was here Supervisor  Doesn’t matter  it’s still against the law Me  This license expired  years ago Lady  Well  duh  I was in prison for  years  I just got out of f  king prison Supervisor  Don’t care  I had another customer to attend to  so I didn’t hear the rest of the exchange  The lady ended up walking away empty handed  My supervisor said I made the right call carding the lady  Our store would’ve gotten in huge trouble for selling things like tobacco and alcohol illegally  I now card just about anyone buying smokes or booze since  You’d think spending  years in jail would’ve made somebody learn NOT to break the law  Hope it doesn’t take another  years to get it through her head TL DR  Ex con tries to buy cigarettes with an expired license from   years ago  She argued with me and my supervisor for a while  but ended up leaving empty handed,2023,356
54,p1p5za,1,3,Dealing with the public is fun     like bathing in acid  So a few tales from when I worked in furniture delivery       So we got a call to deliver a queen size mattress  foundation and bedroom set  now there are a few personal rules when delivering furniture  Due to my size and height If i cant walk through a door without turning sideways  i am two feet and a half feet across the shoulders  a standard couch isnt going to fit and if I have to duck going up a flight of stairs  Im  feet  inches tall  a queen sized foundation isnt going to fit either  We get to the customers home and the first thing to go wrong is that I have to duck going up to stairs  I knew that the foundation wasnt going up those stairs  We did it our best shot and it just wouldnt go  The customer decided that we were idiots and said   Ive moved furniture before and I know it will fit   My coworker and I look at each other with the same thought  The hell you think we do for a living  Not the first thing we said  but the first thing we thought  She tried for several minutes to get it up the stairs herself before admiring we were right and deciding to set the bed up in a room on the first floor      We offered free delivery for all orders  This man comes in and buys a big couch   The salesman offers to have it delivered  Customer refuses and says hell take it home himself  my coworker and I took the couch out to his vehicle expecting he had a truck of some kind  nope  minivan  The couch hung out the back about  inches so the back hatch wouldnt close  We had some rope and managed to secure the couch and tie the door down so it wouldnt move too much  Found out later on that he had to have his door fixed because he hit a bump and bent the door enough that it wouldnt latch properly  Thank God for liability waivers  He threatened to sue the store but he had sign an agreement that said we took no responsibility for damages cause because the customer refused delivery and did it themselves  paraphrasing of course because I cant think of the correct phrasing right now   Gotta love it when people destroy their own property and blame it on you  We even told him this wasnt the best idea  but he just said  Nah itll be fine   The owner one day decided that he was spending too much money on delivery when we made long distance deliveries  His grand money saving idea was to tell us that the drive to the customers home and back didnt count towards our paid hours and only when we got there and delivered the product would count towards hours and as soon as we got back in the truck the clock stopped  You can imagine how that went with my coworker and I  As soon as he finished explaining the plan  we looked at him and said  good luck finding some one to work like that cause we wont  As I said before Im a giant and my coworker wasnt much smaller than me  No one was gonna work under those conditions  He insisted and we told him best of luck and  went to lunch and didnt come back for a couple hours to show him he wasnt going to push us around  and that he would never find anyone who was gonna work like that  He called us back and said he changed his mind and wasnt going to follow through with the plan,3235,631
55,p1p3xz,1,119,Thats My Mom  Maam   A little quick story from a couple days ago Its about an hour before closing  and my mom was on the register while I was bagging  Yes  we work at the same store  My mom is about to pull her till and count it so she can leave When she does this  I start preparing to fill any empty milk  egg  or bread shelves  Mom says the usual  Okay  Im counting my drawer down  then Ill be going home  Love you  See you at home  A customer on the next register hears this and says something along the lines of  Those two shouldnt be working together if they live together  and hes still young  He could do so much better than an older woman  Her cashier  who Im friends with  calls me over  She asks the woman to repeat what she just said  and the woman does so Me   Well  thats just your opinion  and I respect that  but maam   thats my mom  She looks so embarrassed  She just finishes her transaction and leaves without saying anything else  Havent seen the woman since,1004,180
56,p1idoq,1,65,I didnt know it was my responsibility So many people DO NOT use the grocery dividers AND stand real close to the other family  that I often start scanning the next customers order  In fact  some families are same order  just make sure they are separate as we bag  so there is a small space btwn items  and then I think well thats the next customer   My eyes are mostly on the items as they are being entered  make sure they are getting entered  noise level vs beep  and correct price item   This means  my eyes are not anywhere near the end of the belt   No one has arms large enough to reach and put the divider btwn shopping orders All of this said  and I get a customer who told me I had no idea I was supposed to put the divider up  Really  I get not wanting to reach over the belt  though you want me to reach even further for your water soda   or thinking you can pay enough attention to keep me from starting to grab your items  But  not know its on the customer,983,186
57,p1gtub,1,6,How My Day ar Work Went Today So I work at little chain hardware store   Bowls  idk you mightve heard of it  Ive been working there for about  weeks and this has by far been the most eventful day An important thing to know before I begin is that we recently got self check out registers and those registers only take card  Becuase of this we have a register open in case somebody wants to pay with cash  The self check out lanes are always open and we have at least  person there watching over the registers  The store has recently hired a lot more front end people  so now we have an abundance of front end people  So now we have at least  people at the registers   at self check out and the other at a normal register Since weve gotten self chec out there have been A LOT of comments around them and many people have offered some sort of variation of  self check out is stealing jobs  I shall present you todays events in order of appearance  And honestly  thank God were required to wear masks because they have worked wonders in amplifiying my poker face and hiding my wtf faces   A couple around   came in and were standing behind a guy that looked around   Theyve come in before and have offered their opitions of self check out each time I helped them out  When I was checking out the  yr old  his total came out to  X and  cents  The guy paid with a  and when the couple heard want his change would be   X and  cents   the wife offered him  cents so that way hed only get bills back instead of a bunch of coins  I though that was very sweet of them and though this time would be a bit different As I started scanning them the husband began with the usual comments about how our jobs is begin stolen to me and my coworker and self check out and then began recounting their experience in a New Mexico  Gualmart   They said that it was a ghost town and the only thing open was the self check out  then his wife came in and said that because the store was located on a reservation the natives took over the store The wife then went on to say that people that use self check out are all sheep and her husband finished off with   Who do I need to talk to to get rid of these fucking machines   My coworker responded   Well sir we conduct an online survey  you can fill it out and share your thoughts there  After I handed them their reciept  highlighted  and pointed out where they can find the surevy the husband looks me in the eye and says   Cool thank you  youre doing a great job OP  keep it up  and they left with another quick goodbye to my coworker and I TBH they were really nice just   intense  An older man around  came in and was at the end of a rather long line waiting for my register  In the background the head cashier was conducting an observation of me and my coworker  they do them monthly and its just to make sure everyone is doing what their supposed to   Then the guy came up I switched with my cowrker so she could be observed  When I left the register the guy said   Awe you dont want to check my out  No sir  Id love to but we have to switch off every so often but Ill be here if you need anything else   Aaahhhhh I shouldve said that  turns to coworker  you have to be very careful nowadays  you cant saying anothing or a female will get all mad  Like I cant even tell you how beautiful you look   And went on until the transaction was finished  all the while my coworker kept giving him one owrd answers and nodding  Meanwhile the head cashier and I are making a   at each other   I had to explain to an older couple  around ish  how what card pins  cash back  and debt accounts were   A woman wanting to do a propane excahnge  swap an empty tank for a new one   I rang her up and told to give me about   min and someone will meet you outside at the propane tanks to help her  She nods and leaves  Now our propane tanks are in a huge display directly to the left of our exit door  you cant miss them  I went to go grab the head cashier and told her someone paid for a propane exhange and she told me to come with so I could learn how to do it  So were waiting outside for about  minutes  no sign of her  We close up the display and go inside After about another  minutes the same coworker that was hit on by the weird old guy walked over from our lumber desk  end of the store by loading dock  and said  So theirs a woman outside lumber  she said she bought propane and has been sitting there waiting for someone to help her  I told her to comback over here  The head cashier and I were like wtf  So after ten minutes she came up to the register again  She was like  Ive been waiting outside forever no one came to help me  and so on and so on  Both the head cahsier and myself said  We were outside waiting for you but you never came   And she responded   Well I didnt see you  and the propane is NOT outside  now is sombody going toget me my propane     After a few more words were excahnged  the head cashier led her outside to swap her tank and that was the last we saw of her LoVe my job,5114,978
58,p0penh,1,40,Lol  Ive got a short tale for you all that you might enjoy  My supervisor has been having me cover breaks and lunches all day  and while I was on lane   when I had no customers  I waved over a nice gentleman who had a small cart of about   items  We talk and its a very pleasant conversation   but theres a line forming  so after he grabs his bags  he almost missed his meat  which Ive bagged separately   I see him off  and as Im scanning the lady behind him  I notice he missed a bag containing hot potato wedges  Hes almost at the door  so I dont have time to flag him down  I just hold onto his bag in case he comes back  Well  Im told to shut my light off and cover GM self checkout for a  minute break and then go on my lunch  so when I get through my line  I scribble a note on some receipt tape and I walk off  Probably about  minutes into the break Im covering  the guy who was on  asks supervisor where hes to go  and then he sees the potato wedges and starts calling  Supervisor  Supervisor   But the supervisor is too far off  so I ask him if he needs something He holds up the bag of potato wedges and asks for the context behind them  I tell him that they were left behind  and then he asks about the note   What does this mean  Lol      Am I missing a joke or something   I stare at him for a second   Left on lane,1371,273
59,p0c1dj,1,45,Secret until the end Hello  Its my first time posting here so if I need to correct anything or if this story doesnt belong here  Also english is not my first language Warning   funeral deathFor context  I work in a small workshop that sells products and customizes customers belongings  We do a lot of different products  and we all have assigned fields  Mine is engraving  which goes from bottles and glasses to granits A few years ago  an old gentleman  he had excellent manners  came to us asking questions about a granit plaque for funeral purposes  what we can give him  sizes  prizes  etc   Nothing out of the ordinary He asked for a drawing with a text that looked like a poem  all filled with gold leaves  engraved on granit plaque and put on a small pedestal We had other orders to fullfill and had to order the granit from another country so it would take us  months at least to complete the order  He didnt mind and left with a smile He proceeded to come back to see how his order evolved at least once a week  Always polite  good manners and a gentle smile The th or th time he came back  he told us that he was sorry for coming so much  that he was just nervous to pass away before it would be completed  It was really important to him and heres why He wanted to place this plaque on a womans grave  He fell in love with that woman when they were young  She fell in love this someone else  got married and had children  He lived a long and happy life  All this time  our customer had been in love with her  but respected her and supported her as a friend all his life  He never told her again about his feelings  never told anyone about it  and he was never able to stop loving her The poem talked about how two dancers met a summer night and shared a magical moment that they shared and will still exist when the night comes back Our customer wanted to do one last thing for her before he had to leave as well It was hard not to cry after hearing his story  and to this day it is one of the most significant event that happened to me on this job,2090,387
60,p06ehd,1,18,“But I’m A Nice Guy ” A bit of an ongoing story encasing the last month and a half  There’s this one customer I refuse to sell to  full stop no exception  For the past four months he’s usually rude AF when asked to do something that is legit just basic decency and common sense for customers in a store  don’t come behind the counter to grab an employee to get their attention  to grab the store phone  please don’t trash the place  please don’t call our female workers “girlfriend” especially the underage ones it makes them uncomfortable  etc etc  like he will throw attitude and respond with things like “Why ” And “do you want my business or not ” Which I want to say no I don’t but I keep my mouth shut  Well about a month ago I decided I had enough when he threw a fit about a price because I was a penny off in the after tax amount I gave him  A total I had to calculate mentally because he refused to pay at the register  Then he changed and said the amount I said  after tax  didn’t match what it listed x item as on receipt  he referred to the before tax amount  and every time I tried to explain that the amount I gave him was the amount after tax he interrupted me  like I could not get two words in before he complained that it says y amount on the item  THEN he went off about how I need to learn to do my job right and that I’m a bad employee if I don’t have the prices memorized  Again  I was only a penny off  So I walked away before I said something that would get me in trouble  Ever since I’ve refused to sell to him  the other employees are welcome to sell to him if they want  Every time he complains about me not selling to him  that he doesn’t get why I’d do that or why I don’t like him when he’s a nice guy  and that it’s unfair  To add  he had no intention to pay for the stuff he complained about  I intercepted him by chance when he was walking away with it  he apparently thought he got free food just for being there,1956,384
61,p05jsf,1,15,But we closed half an hour ago I was working in a pet supply store  and we also had cats from the RSPCA that we processed adoptions for  and because we liked the cats  we would lock the door at closing time  and just let the cats run around the store while we took our sweet time to cash up and play with the cats  before putting them back in their enclosure and head home  exiting out the front door  maybe half an hour or more after closing One hot summers day  we had been experiencing a heat wave for three or so days  when we did just that  and so it was half an hour after closing that we were walking towards the front  glass  door to leave when an older guy comes up to the door  it doesn’t open so he cups his hands around his face and sees us inside the darkened  no lights on store  and he yells “I need to come inside  I need clippers for my dog” “But we are closed” I replied “But I need clippers for my dog  it’s hot and I need them” “Yeah but we are closed  we closed half an hour ago  there are no registers on  so I can’t sell anything  sorry”It went on for another  mins and he was pissed  but he eventually left  Seriously dude  you wait until the third day of a heat wave  six hours after the peak temperature  at night  and half an hour after the shops are closed to come out to buy clippers   Heat wave ended that night anyway   which was what the weather report said would happen   and what the local weather is like every summer anyway 🤦🏼‍♀️,1475,290
62,p01lsr,1,23,Why me  I volunteer at a small charity shop  There is only one till which is at the far end of quite a long counter  which we use for cleaning sorting pricing donations   Now  I was not on the till  but was quite intensely scrubbing this glass bowl  I had pretty much completely zoned out of everything because I had been methodically cleaning donations for the past  hours  and no one had any need to approach me for anything  because a  I am clearly busy  and b  my colleague was standing just over a metre away from me at the empty till waiting for the next customer  The one thing I do respond to  is my name  There I was scrubbing  and my manager calls my name  so I quickly turn around and go  Yes   and she just looks at me in surprise  waves her hand at me and goes  Customer   like what an idiot  so I turn around and see a woman whos kind of smirking like she agrees with my manager that Im scatter brained  it is true   I first think shes going to ask me a question about how much something is  etc  But then she just hands a bunch of items  Bear in mind  with one hand Im holding a bowl with the other a cleaning cloth  my hands are covered in wiper spray and grime  I awkwardly place the bowl on the table  take the items  all the while staring at her in confusion thinking I must have missed something because what is happening  In the end I just kind of directly pass the items to my colleague at the till who starts scanning them in  and I just go back to cleaning  That was  hours ago  and I still have not come up with a reason why the customer handed me the items to purchase rather than the person working at the till,1650,317
63,ozxz05,1,6,still hate that she did this For reference  I live in the UK This short little story I have takes place a few years ago  when I was working in a charity shop One of the things sold in said shop is shoes  and one day I was carrying out the task of rotating stock  I was doing the shoes when this event occurred  In the grand scheme of things  its not a big deal  but I still think about it every so often So anyways  I was in the process of rotating the shoe stock when a customer came over and started talking to me  no big deal  right  Well  I was used to conversing with customers by this point  but what this customer did still irritates me to this day  She started pinching my cheeks I was about   so you can imagine how I felt about her doing that  At this point  my parents and I had only been living in our new house for a little while  and whilst I by no means know every single person on our street  I am now quite familiar with this woman  but at the time I didnt really know who she was  Maybe it was because my brain was in work mode  Im not sure Yes  the woman who came in and pinched my cheeks   on the shop floor  whilst I was working  is my neighbour This came to light a few days later  when she stopped by our house and said it was her who had visited the shop  Whilst I just replied with a simple   Oh  yeah   as if I suddenly remembered  that was not at all the response I wanted to give Feels good to finally get that story off my chest,1477,290
64,ozxule,1,39,Looking for a wine my daughter had with an obscure label  That pretty much sums it up  This was a few years ago  About   mins to close and lady comes into the liquor store  That’s generally enough time for most people to grab what they need and get out so I let her browse for a few minutes before asking if she needed help because now it is time to close  I didn’t usually mind letting people finish up for a few minutes if we locked the door didn’t let anyone else in and we always closed half of the shutters about  mins to closing Me  Do you need help finding anything Lady  I’m just browsing Me  Ok  it’s just that we close at  Lady  Well your sign was on  Me  Yes  because we were open when you walked in  now we are about to close  Her  I’m looking for a wine my daughter had with an obscure label Me   uh that could be anything  Ok  can you be more specific  Do you know what style it was  What country Her  No  maybe a guess at a colour of label Me  Ok  I’m sorry I don’t know what that could be  If you know of anything you’d like  I can still check you out before we close Her   in an annoyed tone  Well never mind then  I just assumed you were open because you had the sign on  …ok lady  Yes we were open  now we are closing  You are also very vague and I have no idea out of hundreds of wines which one with an obscure label by your standard is the one your daughter had,1404,271
65,ozrejj,1,42,Little kid  big kleptomaniac Last summer  I had my first thief encounter  I worked in a small bookstore that also sells a variety of other items  including stationary  We also had a small toy aisle At the time of this story we knew there had been some theft  as my boss had found an empty package on a shelf with the toy ripped from it I was behind the register when i spotted a kid  around  y o maybe   in a puffy jacket  I’d seen him acting shifty before  so I kept an eye on him  And yup  I watched him grab an expensive toy from the back of the store before heading down to the register where he asked me to return it  He claimed a friend had bought it for his birthday  but didn’t have a receipt One of the store owners was working in the back  so I got him involved  The owner asked the kid a couple of questions  including when his birthday was  He then pulled up the item’s sales record to reveal we hadn’t sold any of this particular toy since well before the proposed birthday  The owner grilled the kid for a bit longer  but he nervously dodged all questions before fleeing  leaving the toy behind  I had my lunch break right after this  and spotter the kid again while walking out the mall  at the nearby grocery store’s gift wrapping station  wrapping something that looked suspiciously like one of our fancy kiddie notebooks  A few days later two young women came to the store with two plastic bags  filled to the brim with items from our toy and stationary aisles  They told us their little brother had bought all of the items without their parent’s permission and asked to return it We immediately knew the brother had to be the thieving kid  this was a small store  so we would’ve known about any kid actually purchasing all of these items  The owners got involved and broke the news to the sisters  They were shocked  but apologetic  and payed for the merchandise The next day  one of the sisters returned with their father  and EVEN MORE merchandise the kid had stolen  including a big inflatable pool    They explained that they’d confronted him  locking him in the bathroom until he confessed   and he had even been stealing money from the family The father thanked us for letting the family handle things before getting the cops involved  He said that if the kid had been caught stealing in their country of origin  they were Afghan refugees   the local shopkeepers probably wouldn’t have been so forgiving  The kid got off with a store ban  and i haven’t seen him since We were all pretty shocked by the sheer amount of stuff he’d stolen  I felt bad for his family  who seemed like they already had a lot on their plate  Here’s to hoping the kid has learned his lesson and left his thieving days behind him,2746,491
66,ozgffr,1,1,Abusive customer There has been an elderly woman shopping at the grocery store where I work since at least before the pandemic  But I dont remember her much before   She only shops in the afternoons and evenings  Sometimes she shows up more than once a day  Anyway  she is aggressive and verbally abusive to customers and staff  I dont usually deal with her as she doesnt shop my department  clothes   but I do hear her yelling at my cashier and customer service peeps  I dont know why no one has grown enough balls to deal with her once and for all     I guess they think because shes elderly she deserves a pass on her terrible behaviour  I dont know  Last week  she tried to hit a customer  This week she started stalking one of our staff members around the store  and she actually attacked her when she was on cash yesterday  The woman went behind the cash  behind the plexiglas  grabbed the cashiers mask off and started pushing her  I dont know why the staff last night didnt do anything immediately  but today  when this woman arrived at the store she was told she is no longer allowed on the property  and is permanently banned from the store  FINALLY  If it had been me  I might be looking at charges myself  because NO ONE is putting their hands on me  EVER  So fuck you lady  Dont ever come back,1319,240

71,oyz2hx,1,40,A lost wallet  no beer  and a jail bed for the night This happened a couple weeks ago   A customer  well call him Jim   who has been frequenting my for the past few weeks prior to this incident  walked in rather agitated and upset   I could tell  because the first word out of his mouth while in the entrance was a loud  F  k    I was at the register and he came right on over   He had lost his wallet and figured it might be in our store   Ill add here that the wallet wasnt actually that important  as he had cash on him  but it will have relevance later   I informed him that we hadnt seen no wallets and checked our lost in found  which we keep locked in our safe  my manager checked when I paged him    Then he made his intention clear  he would go grab some beer and I could ring him up because  I knew he was overage    Our corporate policy requires we ID everyone for alcohol and tobacco products  which I explained to him   I explained this so much I sounded like a broken record   The longer our conversation lasted the more agitated he became   Ill add here that every time I had seen him he had been polite  but was a very weird dude   Jim then became silent midway through our chat and made hand motions to  what looked like to me  putting on a seatbelt  thats when I knew he wasnt desperate  but something was very off about him    He was trying to calm himself down it appeared  and somehow hoped it would erase the previous conversation   Next thing he said was if I could sell him the beer  and a repeat of what I had already told him   Very soon my manager was involved and told him the very same thing   By this point he was fed up and telling me sob stories about how hard it was to g et there on foot  how he knew my manager from high school  they didnt know each other from Adam   throwing insults mostly at my manager and cussing loudly   These were said in a very hostile manner  as if he could snap any time   On his way out the door he started to berate a female customer  asking what she was laughing at   The two customers waiting to come to the register were standing way back  and this young lady was not laughing   Jim then asked her to buy him beer  then extended the invitation out to everyone   A mom in a nearby aisle had heard enough and decided to tell him so as he was leaving   I waved her down because the last thing we wanted was another confrontation   Fortunately he didnt even react and left   Once hes left we tried to get everything back to normal by ringing up the customers who had been waiting on Jim   He wasnt gone more than a minute or two  before he came barging back in with a vengeance  hitting our metal detector along the way and said something that I couldnt distinguish   His next words we could  something about  you have my wallet  and  take me to your lost and found   with explosives mixed in   He came right up to the counter and accused us of keeping his wallet and demanded we take him to our lost and found  because he needs his beer  remember    It was at this point my adrenaline dumped   My heart began racing and I thought the whole time I may actually find myself in an actual fight   I was just standing there  I hadnt moved  unlike my customers who got the hell away from where we were   waiting to see what he was going to do   I wholeheartedly felt  he was on the verge of violent action   Right then  a cop walked in   His demeanor changed instantly  and on the spot he made up a lie about how we had stolen his wallet or something like that   He even persisted in asking the officer to look in the lost and found with him   Within a minute this officer and his partner had him cuffed and led out  all right in front of my register   It became clear when he was being cuffed that he was intoxicated  the officer said he could smell it    I explained to the officers all that had occurred and filled out a written statement   We found out afterward  that another female customer had gone to the back of the store when he started going off the first time  prior to his second entrance  and called the cops   Had she not done that  wed have been attempting to call when he walked back in the second time  my manager had the phone in his hand and was about to while he was accusing us of stealing his wallet  and things may have likely gotten physical   I found out later that another store manager knew the guy and informed me he was a drug addict   It confirmed my suspicions that  a drunk would not be so amped and belligerent  but someone coming off a high might be   All in all  a very interesting life experience I never thought Id encounter,4642,914
72,oywxav,1,45,Sorry for attempting to make something more convenient and cheaper for you  Happened today and I’m honestly still just confused more than anything I work in wireless A customer comes in talking about a free tablet promotion we are running and says that she spoke with a care rep on the phone and they told her to just go to a store  Okay  no problem and thanks for the sale and commission  Was it that easy  Of course not  The customer doesn’t have my company as her wireless provider and was just looking for the tablet to be free  I explain that having a tablet with unlimited data on an account without a voice line makes the tablet line unnecessarily expensive and ask who her wireless provider is for her voice line  She tells me  then says she likes it because it’s only   month  Okay  yea  that’s nice and cheap  I explain that the tablet line by itself would be   month  but if she brought over her voice line and put it on the same account as her tablet line with us  combined  the account would be as low as   month for both  saving the customer   month and making it so she only has to pay  bill for both instead of  Convenient and saves money so I though the customer would be at least receptive of the idea  I was very wrong At this point she begins verbally berating me  Yelling at me and telling me that I’m being rude trying to sell her something she didn’t come in for letting me know if I continue speaking to her that way she would file a formal complaint against me… ummm  Okay  Before I could speak again  she cut me off and said she also didn’t appreciate how I was conducting myself and motioning around with my hands  I tend to be a bit animated when I talk about anything  it’s just the way I am It honestly took every ounce of willpower I had not to snap back at her with “I’m sorry my inadvertent muscle ticks make you uncomfortable”  I don’t have an actual tick  but she was being a real a hole  but being the good little retail employee I am  I just excused myself from the interaction and had my co worker finish the interaction Did we close the sale  Of course not because she felt we were attempting to swindle her and have her do something she didn’t want to do as if I was twisting her arm to bring over her voice line  I merely suggested it as a way to both save her money and make her billing be more convenient… I’m sorry for that I guess  People are wild,2421,450

74,oy8r8h,1,49,It’s my fault you walked out with something you didn’t pay for For context  I work at a general store in a residential area  In this store  our counters are pretty big  meaning if something is placed right in front of it on the floor  I can’t see it  so customers will lift large items up for me to scan  One night we’re nearing close and a couple ends up at my register with a bunch of food and I make my way from where I was cleaning to help them  They told me before I rung them up that they had a budget so I kept an eye on the total  They pay and I immediately turn my attention to the next customer in line as she’s putting her stuff on the counter While i’m checking out this customer  I notice couple from before is outside with a cooler i didn’t know they had  they’re already out the door and I thought maybe they’d brought it in  but I still had my doubts  I finish up with this customer and go back to nightly cleaning Well  woman with the cooler comes back in to buy a pack of cigarettes  I take this opportunity to nervously asked her if they had gotten that cooler from here  and I get a slightly rude “Yes ” I politely explain that I didn’t know they had a cooler and asked if she could bring it back in so I could scan it  Now she’s getting increasingly mad  explaining they loaded it up with the ice and food they just bought and that they were walking home  I ask if she can bring the tag for me to scan and she huffs and walks out the door calling “daddy” loudly to her partner  Turns out they don’t have the money for the cooler  so I call the lead key holder on duty to help me  The lady says she’ll return some of the food and pay for the cooler that way  but we explain our refunds don’t go through immediately and she would still not have enough  She ended up getting super upset at me  saying it’s my fault because I let her walk out with the cooler  I’m getting lectured by a grown woman on how I should have scanned the cooler first because they had a budget  how I allowed them to walk out so “technically” she shouldn’t have to pay for it  plus plenty of other rude comments  She half yelled “I’m a good person so I will pay for it  but I shouldn’t have to” I cried in the break room while the key holder dealt with the issue  My key holder ended up calling the store manager and the woman came in the next day to pay for it  Final thoughts  I understand her frustration  and also understand being on a budget  However I don’t understand how blaming and berating me for not ringing up an item I didn’t know they had is going to fix the problem  Everyday I have customers ask if I scanned their large item and most of the time the answer is yes  and if it’s no  they hold it up for me to scan  I’m a teenager and this is my first job  so i’m still learning  I took this pretty personally and wanted to share this and hear other people’s thoughts,2889,566
75,oy7zra,1,413,Canada doesnt have a veteran discount As far as I know  no store in Canada gives any kind of military discount  veteran or otherwise  correct me if Im wrong  fellow Canadians   We are not as military oriented as the US  Back when I worked at a big red drug store  I worked as a cash supervisor  It was my job to cover my cashiers breaks and make sure customers got as good a customer experience as possible  For those who dont know  drug stores do not sell tobacco or alcohol products so the only item we sell that requires an ID is lottery  relevant later   We also have a seniors day on Thursday where anyone   can get   off  We dont need an ID or proof of age  they usually just know to ask for it since signs are up everywhere advertising the discount This story takes place about mid   before all the COVID drama started  It was a Saturday so no managers were in I was covering my cashiers break when a man comes up with a basket full of stuff  I make the usual greetings  ask if he has our rewards card  and ask if he would like a bag  He gruffly says something about visiting from the US so of course he doesnt have a rewards card with us  He doesnt respond to wanting a bag so I just start stacking his items at the end of the till  When I finish scanning his items  I read off his total and ask if he is paying with cash or card  He tosses an ID on the counter  Me  Oh  did you want lottery Him  What  No  I want a discount  Me thinking he meant the seniors discount  Oh Im sorry we only have seniors discounts on Thursdays The customer looks at me like Im stupid  He shoves the ID closer  Him  Im a veteran  missy  That means I get a discount no matter what day it is Me  Um    Im sorry but we dont do veterans discounts here in Canada Him  Well they do where Im from so you need to honor that I stand there dumbfounded  How did that make any sense  Me  Im sorry but I have no way to put any kind of discount on your purchase  as it is not Thursday for seniors day  and we have no promo going on right now  Him getting obviously upset and red in the face  I want your supervisor  I want you fired  I want a new cashier I blink at him  I can barely get the words out as I tell him I AM the supervisor and there was no store manager in today  The man flipped his lid  He started yelling at me  telling me I was discriminating and I must hate the US and he hoped they bombed my country next and that all of Canada was a stupid place with stupid people  I just stood there not sure what to do  People were starting to stare and I was so freaked out all i could do was stand there with my mouth open going  Uhhh    Finally he said his piece and stomped out of the store with his ID and nothing else  I stood there in silence for a few minutes just trying to process what happened  My cashier came back but i had nothing else to do so I just stayed on till to help with customers A little elderly woman came up to my register to ask if I was alright and that she never liked those  hooligans south of the border   She made me smile and actually helped me put some of the items away that the man had left on the till  It makes me wonder though  does every place in the US give a discount to veterans  And why did he flip out so badly when I didnt give him one here,3330,647

80,oxuozi,1,35,No  I did not use telekinesis to ring you up  I work at a grocery store renowned for its weird flavors and friendly staff  you know the one  anyway the relevant detail is  we do not have conveyer belts at the checkout  You park the cart right next to the register and the cashier takes everything out by hand  Theres no scan gun either  I have to pick everything up This lady parks her cart and tells me she wants half her stuff separate  for a friend  Okay sure  I scan  bag  and tell her the total  Theres still the rest of her items in the cart  She pulls the cart away from me to go use the card reader  on the opposite side of my counter where I cant reach them   with all of her unpaid items in it  I think this is super weird  but maybe she has mobility issues and needs the cart for stability  Then she tries to leave without paying for half her stuff   Maam  I havent scanned the rest of your items  you said you wanted them separate   What  I just paid  I only wanted a separate bag  I already paid for those   Oh  no  sorry maam  I thought you meant you wanted two separate orders  I only scanned the ones that I bagged    Customers in the line next to me are looking at this exchange like shes lost her mind  so at least I dont feel alone I take her cart back to my side of the register and finish while she glares at me Woman really thought I somehow used telekinesis to ring her up without touching any of her stuff  just left it in there without bagging for some reason  and that all her groceries were only,1553,288
81,oxu7m7,1,13,Signs and employees say doors close at   but nope the customer read  So my grocery store has two doors on each side of the store and around   we close one door to direct traffic out one  Well there was one guy heading towards the closed door and I told him that  Well he just argued that the door says til  and therefore the door will magically open due to his worldly presence and inability to read  After some back and forth  each of us sticking to our idea of when the doors close  he eventually gave up and went to the still open door  Regardless of what he read  the doors close at  every night and there are signs before you get to the door  Now if you push hard enough  those doors will open  However I think walking though an open automatic door is easier,769,151
82,oxm1k7,1,62,Lady wants us to call cops cause someone was kind enough to pay for her order  Lady  did not want her stuff paid for  This is mostly from secondhand and a bit from trying to deal with her  First of all she ran her card  but messed up  as Ive explained US  debit is a trick question  Only pick Visa or MasterCard debit    She  rerang it and it kept declining  Gentleman behind her told the cashier that hed pay for it  NOTE  It was the customer not cashier that got the Ladys stuff paid for  At some point manager had to intervene and get the lady to leave the line as she was holding up everyone else Lady does not leave the store and just stands near the front  Manager comes  over to me to tell me her stuff is paid for and shes crazy and wont leave  After I get through my line  having to turn off my light in order to do so as its busy enough  I head over to her  She first tells me    I have no intercourse with you    In my head  Im glad I know that that probably just means no issue with you  but still  the implications   She then brings up some random to me peoples names saying from another location she remembers me    huh   WTF    Then she tells me that the cashier got the customer to pay for her and she didnt want that  She wants the police called I am not about to call the police on a good deed  Nor that the store did  nothing wrong  I go over to the cashier to make sure all is on the up and up and yeah  So  then I get on the walkie to the same manager and tell her this lady wants the police involved and it appears as if she is willing to stay here forever  Thus  we need to figure out some way of resolving this  My manager refuses to deal with it  Though  I guess ignoring her was the right call  as Lady did leave on her own as I went back to what I was doing Roughly  an hour later Lady comes back  I begrudgingly talk to her  Now she still wants the police called  She also wants us to pull up a report to make  sure her groceries were paid for  I told her we cant pull up a report     Technically  we could  but wed have to one wait until the next morning  when the lady who works with the tills is in and two wed have to work hard to figure out which order was hers and three we let her leave her stuff is paid for move on already    I was well overdue for my break  So  I leave for min  She finally leaves for the rest of the night,2387,484
83,ox8ub5,1,46,Guy tries to return underwear and doesnt understand why its unhygienic I was fortunate to not have to deal with this customer personally but was there in observation and was told all about it Returns policy context  we dont offer returns on makeup and cosmetics and most certainly we dont offer returns or exchanges swaps on underwear  The reason why we dont accept underwear returns is because its unhygienic and even if its been packaged back up and or washed  we cant just trust the customers word on that it hasnt been worn that its clean  I suppose the only circumstance we would allow a return is if we literally just served the customer  Onto the story  the customer was a middle aged guy with his two kids and he goes up to my friends till and tries to return his briefs and a t shirt   Naturally my friend explains the return policy to which he flips his switch and argues back saying  HOW IS IT UNHYGIENIC TO RETURN UNDERWEAR    Naturally of course my friend and even my supervisor had got involved at this point to explain to the man that it was unhygienic and why it was He went on to say  HOWS IT HYGIENIC TO RETURN A T SHIRT AND NOT UNDERWEAR    I mean Im kinda at a loss for words here      like seriously Even his kids got involved telling him to shutup  lol  and they even mentioned that he does this a lot so Im sure other retail staff have had the absolute pleasure to deal with this customer before Hygienically speaking  Im sure no matter how many times you wash the underwear   the bacteria and sweat and god knows what else will still be there in some form  I doubt anybody would be happy to know they purchased used underwear,1686,298
84,ox6d3m,1,12,Had to threaten to call police on customer who verbally attacked me over free food So Ill try to shorten this as much as I can  I worked in a small food store  so small that we frequently worked shifts alone in the store  The company who owned this store had a super annoying habit of doing coupons with tons of fine print and rules  Basically get people in with the coupon then upsell the hell out of them or get them away from the coupon to something else  because someone who comes in for a   deal of multiple items will definitely change their mind to pay full price for one box of potatoes 🙄   We also had to have a high ticket average and high gm  so failing to meet these rules with customers would result in bad numbers and ultimately warnings  write ups  etc  Anyway  this day a couple came in  She had a stack of various coupons  The husband left to do shopping elsewhere and I helped the wife  Of course she wanted the deal from one coupon with the free gift included PLUS the free gift from another coupon without getting anything from that coupon  Basically she met the   threshold and thought shed get the free gifts from all the coupons versus meeting the requirements from each  I explained this  She begrudgingly accepted this  though would continue to fight with me every time she picked a new item expecting the free gifts that wouldnt apply  Finally I worked it out to something acceptable for her while also following the guidelines  While checking out her husband came back in  He asks about the free burgers or whatever it was and she got snotty and said  I dont qualify  or something to that nature  He then looks to me and says  You cant just give us some free stuff for spending so much money    Just fyi    was not a lot of money here  One box of potatoes were   regular price and our ticket avg was expected to be no less than     People loved to expect free things for spending soooo much money with us  I told him I explained the rules already with his wife but that we must follow the coupon rules  He didnt like this answer  He started getting belligerent   Its just free burgers  We spent so much  Youre going to give us this free stuff   He actually came around the counter to the side and got into my face  For reference here  I am a  petite female in a store by myself with a man screaming in my face  I told him Id call the police if he didnt leave right now  Luckily I had finished ringing them up and the wife told him to go and they left  He was chuckling the whole time leaving  knowing he scared the crap out of me  He then stood outside the window for a second and laughed more and bucked at me  I called my  at the time  boyfriend and just cried  Then called my manager and we flagged his name in our system  And thats my worst customer service story,2825,530

87,owyuiq,1,84,are you open   were clearly not This happened to me about a week ago A bit of context for the store I work at  when we are closed  there are metal shutters that cover all the doors and windows  To get into the building to open in the mornings  we open the shutters for the exit door  which has no handle on the outside  which is fine  since its an exit door  We open at am This fateful day Im on the opening shift  so Im hanging out with my manager in the office before we open the shutters  when at  am  I remember that specifically  we hear the buzzer that goes off whenever someone opens either the entrance or the exit door  My manager and I look at each other  because neither of us are expecting anyone else to be there yet  Then a man comes into the store Now remember  every other shutter is closed  and the exit door has no handle on the outside  meaning he literally had to pry his way into the store As he walks in he shouts  hello   I step out of the office  look at him  and say  hi   He then asks  are you guys open yet   It took me a moment to be able to respond  wondering how he could possibly think were open  but then tell him not for a few more minutes  He says okay and walks back out He came back in  through the entrance door this time  as soon as we were open and bought his stuff  When he left he forgot his phone on the counter  so he came back a few minutes later  and came in through the exit door AGAIN  despite having already gone through the entrance door once already,1522,291
88,ows16v,1,10,Lady Thinks Competitor Flyer is Our Flyer  I just remembered this story  This happened  years ago this month  I was in my final two weeks with this retail job  I was sick and tired of the manager and the owner of the store  And funny enough  I was moving onto their competitor that is involved in this story  So I had this women walk up to me  handing me a cut out of a flyer  with a heater  asking where this item was  I could tell it wasn’t ours  but the competitors  So I told her it wasn’t our flyer  and the cut out was from a flyer from our competitor  She was rather snarky  saying  “Yes it is your flyer  I cut it out of your flyer  Not your competitor  Where is the heater ” I pulled out a copy of my stores flyer I kept in my back pocket  put it next to her cut out and said “No  it’s from the competitor  Our flyer as you can see has a glossy coating  Your cut out doesn’t  Also  these aren’t our product numbers  and the brand of the heater doesn’t belong to us  You can also see how are product numbers are different compared to theirs ”The women looked at the flyer and the cut out  She said nothing  just grabbed her cutout and walked away,1166,227

94,ow5ghe,1,74,Paying with gift cards that won’t expire  gt  one time   off entire purchase So I work at this popular clothing store at my local mall  and today there was one interesting transaction I came across  and for clarity this originally wasn’t a transaction I was dealing with  but towards the end I had to step in It was closing so all of the last customers in the store were making their purchases  One of my coworkers was ringing up these three ladies who were together  and he was able to open a store credit card for one of them  which is always great for us  Where I work  if you apply for the credit card and get approved you get   off your entire purchase one time  but you have to use the credit card you just opened  you get a temporary shopping pass before the card arrives in the mail   and if you don’t get approved you get   off for trying  Here’s where it got complicated  these ladies specifically came in to use these gift cards they had  and despite getting approved for the store credit card which granted them   off their entire purchase  they were deadest on paying with the gift cards rather than using their temporary shopping pass and getting   off  One of my managers was at the register counting cash and closing registers  and she had to step in and explain that the   off is a one time thing that will go on the store credit card and how gift cards don’t expire  and can be used online  They still didn’t want to use the temporary shopping pass as they initially came to the store to use the gift cards  There was some back and forth between my manager and the ladies  so my manager had me and other associates step away from the registers for some time My manager got fed up and let them use their gift cards rather than take advantage of the one time   off  She dumped the contents of their shopping bags on the counter and had me ring up all their items again because the transaction had to be redone  After ringing up everything their gift cards weren’t scanning  so I had to put BOTH of them in manually  Both had   in them so they just paid the difference  They thanked me for my patience and left Later I mentioned to my manager that I noticed she was frustrated with them  and she stated that she was in fact frustrated as they were doing too much  especially during closing  literally what she said   Personally  I agree with my manager on this as they could’ve use the gift cards ANYTIME  and they passed up on a one time offer of   off an entire purchase just to get their gift cards  that will never expire  out the way,2582,481
95,ow3u09,1,10,Messed up super bad on cash register and am freaking out  Hi guys  so I just got off work and I did let a manager know what happened but I’m still freaking out about it and need someone’s advice So I was ringing up a customer and they bought some clothes that totaled to about   and paid in cash with changed owed  I accidentally hit cash right away instead of typing in the number first  stupid mistake  I know  and so it said “issue    change” which obviously wasn’t correct  I stupidly just closed the cash drawer and decided to just do the transaction again even though that one already went through and the receipt printed out  So I did the transaction the correct way the second time The problem is  that first transaction still went through but I closed the cash drawer and didn’t put any money in it  Does that make sense So that means now that register will be about   short  I’m freaking out now that I’m gonna get in trouble and get fired or that it’ll look like I stole    they have cameras though so if worst comes to worst they’ll see that I didn’t steal Like I said  I let a manager know and she said she’ll figure it out but I’m still really worried and also mad at myself for making such a stupid mistake What happens if a register comes up   short,1291,238
96,ovu3mx,1,80,Customer Orders Something  Doesn’t Give Gate Code To Get Into Where She Lives  So this happened Friday  Both funny and annoying  I work in a retail business that sells lumber  My job is mostly just deliveries  I had to deliveries loaded onto my truck  The second delivery was for in a town that we very rarely deliver too due to distance  which was over a hour drive away  But it was decided since I was   of the way there with my first delivery  I’d drop off the item  The customer was called by staff in the store to let them know I was coming that morning as far as I’m aware  The item was a roll of plastic  feet long  but light  I finish my first delivery  and try punching in the address for the second in my gps  There were some issues with the location because the road names weren’t matching on the gps with what my order form said  I give the customer a call to confirm the address  but all I get is a voicemail  So I leave her a message  saying I’m on my way  but to call me back so I can confirm where they were  I drive to where the gps took me  and there was no road or house number that matched  I try calling the customer again  no answer  So try googling the street in my phone  and a result came up for a little retirement trailer park on the north end of town  and I was on the south end  After fighting through traffic for over  minutes  I arrive  I recognized the park right away  This place required a gate code to get in  This gate is only meant for stopping vehicles  There were sidewalks on either side  I call the customer again  no answer  So I call the administration for the park  and explain the situation  They said if I type the customers house number into the keypad  it will call down to their unit and they have a override  But if the customer didn’t answer  I unfortunately can’t get in So I tried the keypad  nothing happened  I look up a map  to see where her unit is  and it was about half a mile from the front gate  I call down to my store  and talk to the worker who did the order  They were pissed with the customer  saying “Her telling us there is a gate would be very helpful to know ” She tells me she’ll try phoning  and to hold tight  After  minutes  I get a call back from my coworker  saying she can’t get a hold of the customer either  And she didn’t want to have me not deliver the item since it would be a long drive back  So she told me if I could walk to her unit  let her know I am there  I can walk back  and get my truck to deliver her item  As I prepare  I figured I might as well bring the item with me  It wasn’t heavy  and it would save going through the park twice  After  minutes of walking  I arrive  and peer into the back yard  and see the customer working  I call out  informing who I am  And I was pretty blunt in saying we had called multiple times  because we didn’t have any code to get through the gate  She asked me how I managed to get here  and I told her I walked with her item  She immediately started saying how sorry she was  How embarrassed she was  just saying sorry again and again and again  I just simply said “If you order anything more in the future  just remember to give us the gate code ” She kept saying how sorry she was  and told me to wait  I realized she was getting me a tip  so after a moment  she came back  giving me a five dollar bill  I know kinda bad to think  but I thought “I walked a half mile with a large roll of plastic and you give  dollars ” I just kept polite and said thank you  and walked back to my vehicle with her saying how sorry she was  So on my walk back  I phone my coworker  let them know what went on  and they told me when they phone the customer later  they’ll be charging her a larger delivery charge considering what I had to do  This delivery probably took closer to a hour longer then it would have under normal circumstances  So that was my fun  I had to drive back and have a short lunch because I had at least  more deliveries to try and complete before the end of the day,4044,795
97,ovsl84,1,11,Listening to failed robberies unravel over a radio  So  I started a retail job at a store that had just opened up in my city a couple months ago  and I have been waiting for the day to finally tell a fun tale  I have had a couple of run ins with lowkey  Karens  for instance  on the stores opening day  I had a Karen ask me where the business shirts are  I showed her  and she said she wanted a  pack of business shirts  I apologised and said that we didnt have  packs of business shirts  and she huffed and said  You work here and dont know where anything is   before walking off     uhh yeah  its everyones first day  of course were not going to know everything  lol  amp  xB But I digress  the story that this post is referring to just happened on my shift that I just got off of a couple hours before writing this post  for this story to make sense  our store has these  Push to Talk  devices  Im unsure how many other retail stores do this  but Im guessing its commonplace   basically walkie talkies that are fed through an ear piece The first encounter of the day happened about  minutes into my shift  I hear over the radio from a co worker   Hi  a customer just came up to me saying that they saw someone shoplifting and that theyre still in the store  This obviously got my attention  since working the checkouts  there isnt a lot of insane action that goes on other than the odd peak time here and there  I then hear the Manager ask for the description of the culprits and what they were stealing  a bald man with a hat and a green jacket with a partner was stealing kitchen knives by replacing the new ones in boxes on the shelves with crap ones My interest is peaked even more when they said that they had spotted the culprits  and I then hear over the radio   Okay  Ill call security  make sure you check their bags before they leave While this is happening Im fixing up a Click and Collect order for another customer  and when I come back out to the registers and hand the customer their items  theres two security guards and all the managers double checking everything they were buying They ended up being let go  so my guess is that they realised they were caught trying to steal and decided to bail on that idea and just buy the items instead  and I thought that was the end of the excitement for the night  amp  xB But then it happened again  not even an hour after the first event  Im back at the registers  and I hear the manager come on the radio and say  Hi everyone on level   I would like you to keep an eye on a young blonde woman  shes wearing a grey jumper  and is acting really dodgy  just a heads up  me and my co workers at the checkouts all give eachother a look  wondering whats going on  then about  minutes later we hear   Definitely keep an eye out for her  shes definitely stealing stuff  at this point Im kind of chuckling  cause again  this is quite a lot of excitement for someone who stands behind a register for a good majority of the shift  We then hear   Shes heading to the elevators  can someone on the ground floor by the back exit just stand by the elevator near mens  we just want to have a good idea of where she is  and as this is being said  I see a manager running towards the set of escalators in the store And the radio chatter continues   Shes heading towards the beauty section  can we get someone over there   Can someone call security   Security went home because they were sick  Of course they did  Make sure she doesnt get near the exits  Shes just got on the elevator Im keeping watch by the elevator kind of looking around  not really sure what to do at this point  just kind of thinking  What the fuck is going on    only to then hear over the radio  Shes gone into the basement   which made me chuckle again because the basement level hasnt been finished in our store yet  and is obviously a dead end The rest of what happened was told to me by the manager who caught her  he chased her into the basement and into a corner where he started taking pictures of her  Im guessing for the police so they know her appearance  and she immediately started freaking out and crying  after this she yelled  Ive got nothing left to lose   and charged at the manager which obviously got him to back off real fast  and she then managed to get out of the store empty handed we scanned all of the goods she had picked up  and determined that she nearly stole  dollars worth of goods  including a small TV Monitor  Lego Sets  clothes  etc In the end we kind of all came to the conclusion that it was likely a junkie trying to steal stuff from our store so she could sell it on Facebook Marketplace or Ebay to make a quick buck  the next half hour over the radio was them just describing the security camera footage  like the moment she realised she was caught  how desperately she was trying to get away  how funny it was seeing the managers chasing her around  so on Part of me wants to feel bad for the thief because it definitely sounded like she was in a really rough place what with how the manager described her reaction to getting caught stealing so much  but at the same time  I cant help but feel like she was likely going to sell that stuff to get another hit of ice or something   But I guess the thing I got out of this is that there are quite a lot of eyes on you in Retail stores  even if it may not seem like it  Anyway  just thought Id share that experience with you guys  was quite an exciting night for me  TL DR   a couple got caught trying to steal knives  had security called on them and ended up paying for them anyway  and a woman tried stealing  dollars worth of merchandise  was chased around the store for  minutes before leaving empty handed,5792,1065

100,ovo66x,1,2,Asking for ID brings out the worst in some people Ive been working at a gas station in Idaho for almost a year and a half  and I have plenty of stories to tell from my work past  Im not sure why but asking ID from people has a   chance of them either complying with you or try to make a snarky comment on why you have to ID them  Like any gas stations or retail establishments we have beer doors and a beer cooler that you must be at least  or older to enter or grab one  On the very front of our entrance we have a big ol sign that states we will ID you for items such as cigarettes and alcohol  on the beer cooler door we have another sign that you must be   to enter and our glass mirror by our registers have a big sign saying we will ID you  We have to pay attention to the people who come in pairs or in groups  for example if you stay outside of the beer cooler or dont have any alcohol on you we wont ID you if only one of you guys goes in but the others stays out  But if your whole group of six people all go to the beer cooler or grab any alcohol we will ID your entire group  If one of you dont have an ID or if one of you guys has an expired license  we wont sell the entire group anything  Once you start coming in more often in my gas station and I ID you more  I wont ID you if you become a regular at our store  So here we are working a swing shift with my other cashier co worker taking a break  when a group of four people happily greet me and head towards the beer cooler   They seem cool and nice at first  a group of what I assumed were college kids just getting a couple brewskies to drink  All four of them grab something and stand behind two people in line  I helped an old lady with gas and a regular grabbing his smokes he always gets  Now its time for the group of four consisting of three chicks and a guy  All of four them put their six pack of beer and cases on the counter as I start to ring em up  I tell them hows their day going the usual stuff making small talk with the customers  all seem happy telling me they were heading to a party  Cool beans  the ladies stand behind the guy who had his ID ready for me and was about to pull his credit card out  I thanked the guy for showing me his ID without me telling him and I asked if everybody else has their ID on them  They told me he was the one paying so they dont have to show me  the guy stated the same thing as the ladies did and told me they dont have to  I assured them they did have to show me their ID as they went into an area only meant for people who are    They reassured me they didnt have to since he was the one paying  I can start noticing one of the the chicks getting annoyed by me and rolling her eyes as I state once again I do have to see of all their IDs in order to complete to purchase  The guy in the group suddenly wants to go all macho man on me and says  whatever they dont need their ID  and inserts his credit card into my card reader  Me started to get a little flustered tell them all I have to do is hit complete sale and finish this transaction since I already have your credit card information on my system but just please show me your IDs ladies  They tell me I didnt ID the guy in front of them who bought cigarettes and told me he looks younger then them  I once again reassured them I ID him the first time I saw him and multiple times after that  I told them hes a regular who buys the same cigarettes and lotto tickets once or twice a day  The thing they did next kinda made me laugh and caught me off guard  Chick   in the group says fuck you and tries to complete their purchase on our self checkout machines  Funny enough they need my badge barcode to verify theyre   So here we are a bunch of college looking adults standing in a hissy fit because I wont sell them beer  Finally after  minutes of dealing with them  chick   says I dont have my ID and chick   has her ID but its expired  Oh boy I just tell them Im not selling you any of you guys beer  They all flip me off and called me a fucking loser  as they tell each other to head to another gas station  Oh wells  luckily for me they were the only customers at the store during that time and I just go ahead and put their stuff back where it went and continued my evening shift,4304,880
101,ovk8w1,1,8,Got called a b tch at my new job for the first time i would first like to say that i’m new to reddit and this sub so if there’s anything that’s probably not in the ordinary it’s because i’m not very good at using this site  so i started working as a cashier two weeks ago and for the most part i’ve been pretty good at the job considering i have never worked in my entire life  i’m  btw   i was also having a pretty good day yesterday too because i finally was able to hold a conversation with a coworker without being awkward as hell lol  anyways yesterday is where everything starts  it was like  pm and i leave at like   so one of my senior coworkers told me to shut off my light because i would be leaving soon and she didn’t want me to suddenly have a huge line to deal with  i only had two customers left  i was already ringing one of them up and at the time  i didn’t notice the other customer that was in line  i finished ringing up the first customer and then thats when i noticed my next customer which was a little girl  i was about to also ring her up because she came in line before i shut off my light  However  my bagger told me “what are you doing  we’re done”  i shouldn’t have listened to him tbh because he was also new  anyways i told the little girl that this lane was closed  and she was going to have to go to the next line  she responded saying “well my mom is going to be frustrated”  i laughed it off not knowing the mom would be MORE than frustrated  ’  a minute or so later as i was about to leave  the mom came up and spoke in an already annoyed tone saying “where’s the lady before me  ”  she was asking for the previous customer which idky  and i proceeded to tell her that the lane was closed  she then yelled saying “i was already in line when the light was on and now you telling me we can’t do it here  ”  it was my first time interacting w a mad customer so i panicked and just repeated that the lane was closed  and thats when she said “man whatever you bitch”  ’  she then went to my senior coworker who was ringing up her items and proceeded to rant to her about me and kept saying “SHE KNEW TOO I WAS THERE  SHE KNEW” which i genuinely did not know until my first customer was done  but it just bugged me when my coworker kept telling her “i’m sorry about that”  i already felt like that whole situation was my fault and the sorrys confirmed it for me  ’  this honeslty isn’t that big of a deal  it’s just been bothering me all day yesterday and today  i have a really hard time socializing and this job was helping me a lot  but this one small situation felt like i been set back  i just want to ask  do you guys think this was my fault  i feel like it partly is  but at the same time i felt like she was being unreasonable  considering by the time she went to the other cashier  her items were already being rung up  so she wasn’t really wasting any time  but yeah idk  just wanted to spill all of this somewhere and didn’t know where  i really hope this was the right sub to go to lol,3046,602

103,ouvngl,1,46,The vodka must glow because  Chernobyl So a tiny bit of context first  I have been working for a major wine liquor store for about a year and a half and primarily deal with wine  but do work with other liquors too  This actually only happened about  hours ago so I’m still trying to process this interaction  I did not take part in the actual interaction but was witness about  feet away for the event  So I came around the corner from our receiving room to find one of my assistant managers helping a couple of customers  They apparently are looking for vodka and my manager recommends one of our best vodkas that isn’t particularly well known and mentions that she’s had it before and that it’s very smooth  The customer then asked where it came from  and my manager tells them it’s from Ukraine  Now this triggers a really strange physical response  as if they were recoiling in fear  They then say that they won’t get anything from Ukraine  Now this is certainly a bit strange but customers do and believe weird things sometimes  My manager just sort of shrugs it off at first and just tells them that it’s really smooth and that she thinks they’d enjoy it  This triggers one of the couple to suddenly launch into a passionate  or  minute rant about Chernobyl  He goes on to say that he knows all about the Chernobyl disaster  which mind you happened in   and that it’s still burning and spewing radiation that that the cloud covered everything  He mentions that he knows that the famed elephant foot in the plant is going to burn for  in his words  fifty thousand years and that he is not going to even touch anything from Ukraine because he knows it’s all radioactive and that it’s irresponsible for us to keep it in our store  This leaves both me and my manager completely speechless  I mean how do you respond to that  The customers just sorta march off as if they’d won some great victory in an argument with us  I was totally speechless for a few minutes after because  do people seriously think that the this is still such an active problem in day to day life even now I know that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is an ongoing issue in Ukraine and that they are still trying to figure out what to do with it  But the radiation isn’t near as widespread as it was in the first days after the disaster but these people seemed to genuinely believe that the entire country of Ukraine is an irradiated wasteland and that anything from there is inherently deadly or toxic to human life,2504,456
104,outau8,1,83,Your local discounter is not a dating site I was on register duty today but it was slow so I was in the aisles tidying up  I like to regularly peek into the aisle leading to the register to not keep a customer waiting which was when I saw a woman put an enormous amount of batteries into our battery return box  a shopping basket next to her on the table  So I walked over and asked her whether shes already been served by my coworker and if I can take her basket off of her  She explained she just grabbed it and is disposing of her batteries before going through the shop  So I just lingered by the registers for a bit and had some water when a man came through the store and approached the lady  He introduced himself as  Mike  and asked her if shes single  She looked over to me  then back to him  then went  No   in a very matter of fact tone to which he responded  oh  ok   put his shopping basket away and left the store The poor lady and I could only stare at each other in confusion,998,195

106,oulyla,1,4,I am apparently a crook and a liar This happened a few months ago now  but it will probably be one of the more memorable interactions for years to come  There will also be a tl dr at the bottom  I am apparently long winded  amp  xB I work in a decently sized liquor store  and the other day during a woman came in  I saw her and asked if she needed any help  and she said that one of my co workers had actually just helped her  I said great  and to let me know if she needed any help or had any questions  Same woman was hanging around my area so after another  minutes I asked her if she was still doing alright and she said she was doing fine  A couple more minutes pass and she is leaving my area and I just triple checked  and asked if she found what she was looking for  The woman said yup  and went on her way towards the front   amp  xB Here is where the story starts takes a turn  A different co worker paged back to me and was asking about the price of a bottle that the woman had picked up  I told my co worker the price      and they informed me she thinks that she saw the price for     I told my co worker to let me look around and Id be up in a second   amp  xB I went and checked the shelf tag  it was the correct price  I went to check the display tag  it was the correct price  Last place to check was a large display table and I found the bottle Karen picked up  next to another bottle that had a tag for     I picked up both bottles as I found them and walked them up front  I politely explained that the bottles were sitting right next to each other and that while the tag for her bottle was missing  the other bottle was labelled correctly  and that we would not be selling her the bottle she wanted for      amp  xB As I am explaining this to her she starts muttering under her breath that she knew she should have taken a picture of the bottles  or that she should have brought the bottle with the tag up  I told her Im sorry  if the bottles would have been labelled incorrectly we would have matched the price  but that was not the case  She then states that she doesnt want the bottle and I say that is fair  so I take the bottle and put it back on the table   amp  xB This woman then proceeds to hang around the store after her purchase  and eventually talks to a manager about how I must have switched the tags around so we would not give her the price she saw  My manager then asked her if she knew what bottle it was  or what I looked like  or what the price was supposed to be  Conveniently she didnt know the answers to any of those   HOWEVER  in her  star google review she at least knew what I was wearing and that it must be nice to watch the Olympics all day  and that she cannot believe I still have a job with the terrible customer service I gave her  tl dr A woman called me a crook and a liar because we wouldnt just take her word that the price was wrong  and that I must have switched some tags around,3003,578

113,ot5xfm,1,0,My first truly INSANE customer TW  Lots of Racism  Homophobia  violence and probably moreHey everyone this is my first post so I apologize in advance if I mess up with how its made or whatever but this is something I just really had to share  Buckle up it’s going to be a long and crazy road ahead  This whole story sounds fake but trust me its not I wish it was because I feel terrible even parroting what he said I bit of background for this story is that I work as the yard man for a popular Canadian farm garden hardware supply store so I am NOT used to stuff like this  I was a farm kid and don’t spend as much time with customers as other staff so needless to say my customer service skills are not   I say stuff as it is so that probably made this situation much worse Also this customer was probably   lbs and   ’ when i’m muscular  ’” and lbs  just so you guys can picture him yelling LOL  Important names  not our actual names crazy customer   “Kevin”Me   “rob”I had a customer come in today that was a lot more lets say talkative and open than the regular person should be  Right off the bat I could tell they were a serious a   interrupting  questioning everything  making fun of people and just being an overall terrible customer  He began by asking where our hardware cloth was I told him where but followed up with “which type are you looking for  because we are sold out of sizes ”x ”  ”x ”…” he just blew up  Saying what the F  K did I ask what types you don’t have  DID I  NO  I was asking where they are  So I tell him where they are and he waddles over I thought that would be the end of that  i was not that lucky  got a frantic radio call from a cashier lets call her “Morgan” saying “”Bob” please come up to cash when ASAP I have a customer looking for something and saying you sent him to the wrong place” all the while you can hear “Kevin” yelling in the background  I go up  once he sees me he hobbles over and points his mini sausage finger to my face saying “You Lying FA  OT  Im not homosexual so TF is that about  YOU SAID THERE WERE LOTS OVER THERE ” I did not I even said we are probably out before  After listening to him hurl every swear a  year old would know I somehow managed to calm him down and have him come outside so we could look together  Sure enough we had none of the right hardware cloth  he said some more choice words than retreated back to the door  on his way he noticed a  gallon stock trough and decided the price was the same as the  gallon trough  spots to the right  After more yelling he calmed down and started oversharing about his beliefs like how masks don’t work  people are sheep if they use them and spouted off about pointless numbers and graphs that don’t mean anything  This is the funny part he began talking about how people are being mind controlled by the government and how the government is run by   amp    ’s  Awful racial slur used to discriminate against Chinese people  and how our   amp     overlords are controlling and watching all of the people   He said something about assassinating Justin Tredeua and deporting all non white people and killing all Muslims before they kill us  He also said lots about homosexuals being exterminated and going to hell  “Kevin” loved saying how he is very smart actually double the average IQ of people like me  Even though he was that smart he couldn’t figure out how to use a computer  He was angry the store used security cameras because he didn’t consent to being recorded EXHALE… I think that is itFYI this was not in the correct order once he began being racist  homophobic and violent I told him to get out of the store and if he didn’t i would call the cops  He went coward mode and left thankfully Can someone please tell me if anything like this has happened to them because i have never experienced anything half as bad as this here it didn’t seem real,3928,728
114,osyhgu,1,56,My first unreasonable customer  I started working retail a little over three years ago as a side job to my long time factory job  Im divorced and the kids are grown so I was bored and applied when a new store came to town and they hired me  big surprise to me  but Im older and responsible so they work with me on the hours and it works out       Ive actually been having a pretty good time with it since its so different from my full time job and I really wondered about the horror stories people tell about the horrible customers they encounter until about a month ago      I was working the register when an older gentleman comes in and starts raising hell about something  Im occupied and there was a new boss talking to him so I wasnt paying much attention  The new boss is a younger girl and shes a real sweetie and I dont think she deals with things like that well so this guy is just reaming her       One of our services is filling propane tanks  like you use on a grill  and I guess this guy is missing an O ring to his tank  He is saying we are responsible for maintaining the tanks and we need to take care of this problem for him  New boss is trying to help him but she screwed up at first and told him we dont maintain the tanks and that wasnt what he wanted to hear so hes on a rant  a rant like I havent heard out of a customer       I finish with a customer and have a bit of time so I walk over and catch up with what is going on just as hes talking about our responsibility to maintain his tank again so I step in and tell him we fill the tanks and that is it  I tell him we dont have parts  training or any kind of tools to work on tanks  He isnt having it and seems even more angry that Im arguing with him and keeps repeating himself about our responsibilities so I ask if the gas station where he fills his car is responsible for maintaining it which pushes him further over the edge but he just keeps repeating the same thing over and over like it didnt matter what we said  if it wasnt what he wanted to hear he wasnt going to acknowledge it       I finally just told him he needed to leave and he told me wouldnt be back  I dont recall ever seeing him there before so I doubt hell be missed but now I know what its like to have an unreasonable customer,2307,475

116,osfs91,1,70,in overage charges and it’s allegedly my fault   Sorry for formatting  on mobile So a bit of background  I work for a retailer that provides mobile service There are  major characters to this story  me  OP   coworker  CW   angry lady  AL   angry lady’s mom  AM So earlier today  I have a customer  AL  that comes in angry and upset and I ask how I can help them  She begins to give me a very lengthy explanation about how she signed up for our mobile services from CW and had racked up    in charges for a shared plan on her mother’s  AM  account  She begins to tell me about how her mother  AM  is on fixed income and how she can’t afford it and she’s going through a lot in life right now  So I express my sympathy and attempt to help her out  just walking into the situation  This is where it gets interesting Every time I would try to read off what is on my computer system or billing ledger for her  she would interrupt me and go on a tirade about how that’s not what she signed up for  or how the billing is incorrect As it turns out  the person berating me  AL  was the one who racked up all the charges  And when I tell her that  she explains to me that her some has autism and uses the phone non stop  Not a problem  but it still doesn’t resolve the fact that she was the one who went over  She then tells me that all of her phones on that plan should have been unlimited  I called up CW who helped them and he confirmed they signed up for a shared plan to which she  AL  profusely refused and told me it was supposed to be unlimited when in fact  my coworker had told me they insisted on the shared plan  She switched to unlimited but the charges remained because it was from a past billing statement  She demands I refund her  which I have legit no authority to do so especially for a    credit   so I email my supervisors and regional managers about what I should do At that point all I could do was send an email and provide her some phone numbers to get her pointed in the right direction  By this point AL was calmer and apologetic and thanked me for helping her Not  minutes later  she  AL  comes back in and interrupts me while I’m helping other customers and berates me in front of other customers and shouts at me that they will not refund her  So she forcefully puts her phone into my hands and has me speak to the phone rep and they explain to me it was a legitimate charge because they cannot refund her  So  shes shouting at me while I’m talking to this phone rep  and before I can get more information from this rep  she snatched her phone out of my hands and said “fuck this  fuck all of you  we’re going to the bank and cancelling the charges and switching carriers” and abruptly leaves  The only person I felt honestly bad for was the mom  And apparently she was more upset than AL  TL DR  was thrown into a situation I had no hand in  angry lady comes in racking up    charges in overages  demands I refund her  I can’t  Comes back to berate me more and basically tells me to go fuck myself,3071,579

118,orvpcn,1,181,Working with a “No Return Refund” policy… My coworkers and I suffered so much abuse because of the store’s No Return policy  For context  it was a Beach Shop in a really popular tourist destination  The policy existed because people on vacation would buy everything they needed  then return it all at the end of their stay  It was also a health safety issue because people often tried to return their worn or broken bathing suits  I’m not exaggerating—  times  the bottoms presented to me would have skid marks in them  I kept disinfectant spray at my counter because of it  To deter this  my boss put up giant signs  everywhere  that said “No Returns Refunds ” followed up with the details  all this was in place years before I started working there   Employees were required to repeat it before every transaction and it was printed on every receipt  Despite this  people would still come back determined to get a refund  Once  a lady had a full on meltdown because she couldn’t return her ripped up bathing suit top  She was crying  screaming  shaking  and chased my boss around the store with it  I had to call the police for them to make her leave Another time  a grown man chucked their beach chair at my ’ female coworker Regardless of how people feel about the policy  the store absolutely was within their rights to enforce it  No one tricked the customers either—it’s actually embarrassing how in your face we had to be about the policy  So why did customers still try to return things then go crazy when they couldn’t,1541,263
119,ort6xw,1,0,The day where everything happened so much I work at a store known locally in my area for being pretty chaotic  and while its usually much calmer after covid upset the atmosphere and allowed us to get the store under control  we still have a lot of  what the fuck  events that occur on the regular  Most of them are related to shoplifters or customers that get brainworms when they walk through the door and forget how normal human beings are supposed to act  One day in particular  However  I was working a long shift at the fitting room  and it was the strangest one on record so far First thing I see when I walk in is the coworker Im replacing  looking uneasy  I expect her to warn me that theres a trouble customer  and in  a way  she does    A customer has been in one of the fitting rooms for an hour  I take her place  and both of my managers appear  one of them hanging out with me and the other inspecting the fitting rooms  It was busy when I showed up  but soon enough  theres nobody else in the fitting room but her  and while wandering manager is nearby  the woman inside peeks out  then immediately locks the door as WM approaches  Another hour passes  We occasionally hear clicking  probably from her trying to defeat the hard tags on the clothes shes undoubtedly trying to steal  Eventually  One of the managers knocks on the door  and tells her she needs to leave  She comes out begrudgingly  claiming that she fell asleep  leaving the clothes she was trying on  two have the price tags ripped off  one has a hole where the hard tag was violently ripped out  shes left HER OWN sweatshirt in with the mix  and one of the items she went in with is missing  I think peace has returned to the fitting room  Managers scatter  and we start going about our normal business  One of my coworkers comes to clean the bathrooms  which are about ten feet away from where I have to stand all day  Not even fifteen quiet  incredibly normal minutes later  another coworker comes to throw something away and finds a number of very bloody paper towels in the trash by the bathrooms  I check in one of the bathrooms  and find even more  Theres so much blood  The bathrooms are locked with a pin pad  anyone I let in has to walk by me to leave  and my racks and caddies and such are placed so that Im usually facing the bathrooms when Im working on things    And yet neither I  nor any of my coworkers constantly coming and going  noticed any event that would have caused blood  much less cleaned up blood ending up in the trash OUTSIDE the bathroom in plain sight  I can only guess that one of the people I let in predicted and quickly dealt with a nosebleed  but    why put some of the cleanup outside  And so much  I just dont get it Finally  as if fate knew that I felt safe  my manager finds the shirt  He picks up  a shirt that someone has abandoned where it doesnt belong  and as the resident wrangler of textile goods  he brings it to me  He hands it to me  I grab it It is wet I Immediately say    Manager    what the hell   and hes obviously concerned  as thats an unusual reaction for a fitting room attendant to have when being given a shirt  Upon inspection  its soaked around the hard tag  so soaked in fact that the price tag is completely dissolved and mostly gone  He takes it  and I forget about the incident after washing away the memories with hand sanitizer  Later  though  as Im going on my last break  I get up to the front to do my walk and a bunch of employees and the managers are there  chatting about the lady from earlier  After a little chatter  I ask my manager if he found out why the shirt was wet  He explained that he had checked the cameras  and found that the shirt had been abandoned by a family    with small children Basically  a child sucked the price tag right off a shirt It almost made up for how agonizingly boring my next shift was,3904,721

130,oqkj06,1,12,Thats not good enough   Its store policy to leave  non purse  bags and other stores shopping upfront so there is less chance for you to slip something in them and steal  We have cameras but honestly if you place them in various places we allow  noone steals your item  Granted a lot of people still bring big enough bags  but it seems like they are purses or for their babies and other stores shopping w o a care in the world  We only find out about it when they are checking out Granted this customer did not know the cashier was new  but still she hadnt been taught this fully yet He leaves under   worth of a Dollar store worth of items on her till where customers bag there stuff  Granted  its in a yellow bag vs our white bags  Still  somehow by the time he comes back from shopping in our store  its gone  We try and locate it  maybe one of us moved it to where it belongs   NOPE  Then  I was told to come and talk  I wasnt even in the area yet   I had first thought it was him shopping again at our store aka forgot a few things  Asked for a receipt and he tells me yeah I have it and shows me the dollar store receipt along with telling me I left this up here so you know I didnt steal  After I got up to speed  I tell him sorry nothing we can do  Shes new and will be taught now how to handle these requests Thats not good enough  I tell him  OK Ill contact my manager and see what they say  She tells me to say all we can do is have you come back in the morning and look at the cameras Thats not good enough  I then point my manager out to him so he can talk to her himself  She comes closer and tells me again  I think since he was clearly more English and She is more Spanish wants me to be translator  I tell him that again Whats her name  You arent doing your jobs We repeat we are sorry  and then we move back away  I reopen my till  lines were getting busy   He leaves after he sees weve now ignored him We are not responsible for keeping track of your items  That said  like I said above  we dont have an issue  provided you keep it away from people in a rush to get home  Also  I know people are in different situations  but   of   store items  should not be  Not good enough  lets cause a scene over it,2262,440
131,oqjm7x,1,4,Customer  Its not my problem  NOTE  I did not check to be   sure  but Im quite sure its pretty obvious that even if true customer still was in the wrong and should have known that was the case The workers at the Bakery try to leave at pm  store closes at pm   they might be there cleaning and still willing to create an order for you  but basically  save for mass manufactured baked goods and the  pack of min bollios singles and regular sized bollios as well  there is no more to be gotten In particular  we have various Mexican doughnuts cookies cakes etc on trays you see at bakeries  which are behind glass doors  which if they did their job right have a  plastic  bag covering over them  Which makes it beyond obvious that they arent accessible right now  I cant vouch if we have a sign up  but as established customers dont read  Its very close to pm  I see this guy has  cupcakes and  half gallon of milk  Quick side note  I counted them  he initially was trying to get me to agree to   Then he  jokingly  said     I now am saying no theres   Also  you shouldnt have these as these are inaccessible right now after pm  He says not my problem  I just diffuse the situation by agreeing and saying that I will make sure they are reminded I was in the area just a few minutes earlier and had to tell a couple sorry bakery is closed after they asked  Its so rare that anyone tries to get any themselves  I mean  there have been times they dont put the bag over all   but even then  customers realize that its closed  I dont even know if this customer found tongs or not  I hope so  At least it was cupcakes and probably all of them It wasnt just the words  but the way he said it and his demeanor afterwords  At least he thanked me in an unexpected tone that I bagged his groceries  And we were able to say have a good night,1873,352
132,oqis8e,1,25,Kids get on my nerves sometimes Hello  This is my first post on this sub  Today was very eventful  but Ill just share this particular story Im a formal childcare worker  I LOVE working with kids  and thats no secret  But today the universe decided to test me I  M  work at one of those stores where everything is pretty cheap but theres really good variety in products  I was doing my business on register when suddenly I hear a weird buzzy beepy kinda noise  far off in the store  I look to my coworker on the other register and we both make confused faces and shrug  A few minutes later its still going and she asks me what that is  I say  Maybe its the emergency exit   She says that probably it  and goes to check it out She comes back and says yeah someone pushed open the emergency exit door  and nobody here has the key to make it shut up So we suffer Cue me apologizing for the noise to every customer I have to ring up and explaining that someone opened the emergency exit and we cant turn it off  so sorry maam Then a family comes up to my register  and this kid  young  but definitely old enough to know better  points out the noise and says  Haha that was me  It was an accident though   His mom says that he wanted to open it because he thought something was back there and wanted to go see it   So it  therefore  was not an accident  This is fine  No problem  I understand curiosity But then  This kid starts spinning the bagging station around while Im trying to bag things  whining to his mom the whole time about how he wants to go home and shes taking so long  I keep trying to bag things but he wont stop spinning it  so I just start scanning things and setting them to the side on my station instead of attempting to bag them  His mom tells him to cut it off and that Im trying to do my job Then he starts complaining about how he wants his toy and he wants it now  His mom says that I probably already bagged it  and then he accuses me of hiding it from him for some reason  Then he complains that some of our balloons are all the way up on the ceiling and shouldnt they be down lower  how will we get them down blah blah blah so I give my classic kid banter of  Hey if someone was really really tall they could just jump up and grab it  Kid laughs  I feel accomplished He doesnt help his mom put her bags in the cart  but he leaves  and thats what matters That was only  minutes into my shift  and now we had to wait for the boss to show up so we could deactivate the door,2539,477

135,oqc26w,1,97,I had a breakdown in front of customers after being forced to work during a power outage I used to work at a small grocery store in a very tourism driven town  At the store I worked a shift with what we called the ‘Zillennial Crew’  because literally all of us  including the manager  are under the age of   Earlier this week someone hit an electric pole with their car and knocked out the power for almost the entire town  This happened at about  pm which is two and a half hours before the store closes  The store’s backup generator kept things alive for about ten minutes  then everything went kaput  Everything except one check stand  at least  We think it had some kind of battery back up  Only half of it was working though  the cashier screen with the buttons  the cash drawer  and the receipt printer  No barcode scanner  no produce scale  no card reader  When the manager called the big boss  who was actually very mad at the manger for calling because it interrupted his golf session  he was told and I quote  “Since you still have a working check stand  you need to keep the store open until at least  ” Needless to say  myself and the rest of the crew weren’t too happy about that  but the big boss threatened to fire us if we didn’t  so we tried to make the best of it  Since I’d been assigned to the half working check stand before the outage and the manager didn’t have a key to open the other cash drawers  I was going to have to check After some brainstorming with the manager  I figure out how to manually put in grocery items and the rest of the crew man the automatic doors and search for flashlights  The set up was something like this     people at the doors informing people of what was happening   Customers without cash were immediately turned away   Customers were advised to have some form of light to navigate the store but we did have a few spare flashlights they could borrow   Customers told to not open freezer cooler doors until they were ready to make their selection   Customers told to take a picture of every item’s price tag and show the pictures to me I did that for an hour  On top of all that craziness  there were about a dozen alarms going off across the store because none of the coolers were on  a system meant to help ID if a cooler has stopped working  but not very helpful during a power outage   So there were a dozen or so loud  blaring  shrill beeps going off almost constantly  The entire hour   o’clock finally comes around  and right on cue  my check stand dies  I immediately break down crying  I cannot form words  The crew explained to the customers and convince them to put their items back  everyone got really pissy because ‘it was just working a second ago’   I have to sit down and try to collect myself  One of the crew sits with me trying to help me with some relaxing breathing  One of the customers decided to be snotty on their way out and said something like “Tell that fat stupid bitch to stand up and stop crying ” They were forcibly escorted out by the manager and one of the burliest crew members  Manager calls big boss  tells him we’re closing  Other workers sweep a bit and we all leave I ended up quitting a few days later  but  the whole situation still makes me mad,3263,601

146,oogrpd,1,1,Why third shift is the best shift… I graduated college and got a new job… real career move  But I miss my job as a third shift cashier at a convenience store  Here’s why…Third shift is when all the action took place  Whenever the cops were called  it was during my shift  Usually it was the drunk couples on their way home from the swingers club up the road  They’d come into the store and start really random fights with each other  They always tried to involve me and get me to choose a side  but I just told them I was there for the show and to be on standby in case things went too far  Weekends were the best because we got the drunks AND the stoned people AND the drunk stoned people  They are actually really funny  and easy to get along with  The only thing I hated was when a drunk person drove themselves  and I’d have to pull the emergency switch to shut down all of the gas pumps  It was amusing to see them on camera as they tried to figure out what was happening  It sucked to call the police on them  but we had to  We couldn’t just let them drive home  The cops told me they usually just escort them home  give them a ticket  and tell them they’ll go to jail if they do it again  I hope that’s true  When I’d have class during the day on a Friday then go to third shift that night  I’d be in a weird tired state that would get really amusing to me and my coworker  I remember one night somebody ordered a dangerous amount of fries  I dropped them in the fryer and started laughing my ass off  I was bent over  tears in my eyes  needing the bathroom kind of laughing  My coworker rushed over  thinking something  was wrong  Between my laughs  I managed to explain that when I dropped the fries in the fryer  I swore I heard the potatoes screaming as they went down  Time flies by on third shift  In our factory town  we would get a huge surge of factory workers at   am who were coming in for their breakfast before work  It was really rewarding to have conversations and get to know them as people  They often told us that we helped them get their day off on the right foot  Most importantly  my boss worked first shift  So I’d be out of there right as she came in  Never had to work with her  I worked with only one other person  so we had a very interesting friendship  Together  we got to experience these things and still look back at them fondly  Any fellow retail workers agree  Disagree  Maybe just a funny story  Sometimes I think about going back just for the heck of it  but retail is hard work  I often say that everybody should work retail once in their lives  Cheers,2615,501
147,oog9t4,1,1,I wrote this review for a customer service agent from Skyscanner  Preamble for Reddit  Customer service is difficult  frustrating  Often with no growth  For this one case  I wanted a write a glorious review  I hope it gets the agent a bonus  a promotion  or simply make her day  So I wrote this  and I meant all of it I faced a rare situation   I booked my flight through a rather unknown agent  Gotogate  and I couldnt board my flight due to lack of a transit visa that I was not aware of  The airline assured me that I can get a refund  but I can only get it via Gotogate  Gotogate was unresponsive  unreachable   I also found several hundreds of cases on facebook and twitter where people alleged that Gotogate didnt refund them  Some of these cases alleged that they hadnt got their refunds for more than a year I had given up hope for even a reply from them  let alone getting my money back  I had given up  blaming it on sheer bad luck Then  Skyscanner and mainly  Michele happened  A sheer stroke of luck  Michele not only put me in touch with Gotogate  she was the patient mediator and a pillar of support for over  months  Ive worked in customer service myself  and I have not seen anyone hold their patience for   months  But Michele did Because she was there  I trusted and felt confident that I could indeed get my money back  Im a student  and  euros is a big deal to me  Michele provided transparency  consistency and most importantly I could trust her   I had faith that its possible  I could relax and think  Shell do her thing and make it work   At the end of every message shed write  Im always there   Im very grateful for the support she provided   it was an unparalleled and a unique experience to completely trust someone I have never met  but I believed it was possible because she was there all the time  whenever I wrote an email Im grateful and lucky to have her assigned as the agent on this issue Many thanks to Michele  and Skyscanner,1994,362
148,ooe5k0,1,160,Wow just wow  Pissed everyone off  We had this idiot come in  minute before closing time at the store yapping away on her phone  We make several announcements  minutes to closing   minutes to closing   minutes to closing  final one at pm to say store is closed   After paging the store to say the store is closed at pm  we wait for that idiot to come up so we can ring her stuff up and everyone can go home  We waited for like  minutes and when we walked by each isle  we saw her on the wine aisle still yapping away with a few items in her arms  When we informed her that the store had been closed at   she was like no no let me finish my phone call first  We were nice enough to let her do that  and  minutes later  we walk up to her again and let her know that it is time to checkout so everyone can go home  We were about to page for the manager on duty to come up to the front and he would have loved to tell her off  Anyways  she comes up  minutes later  still yapping on her phone  After we ring up her items and tell her the total  she shoves her card in my face  expecting me to take her card  all while still yapping away on her phone  I clench my jaw to not say anything stupid  and inform her that she needs to swipe her card on the machine  She puts her phone down and tells me   dont play dumb with me   then immediately goes back to yapping on her phone  Wow  really lady  Fortunately  she eventually swipes her card on the machine then tells us  have a good day  while continuing to talk on her phone as she finally leaves the store  By now  its  pm,1590,318
149,ooczma,1,39,I just want gold    I work at a pretty small hardware store  I work best in mixing paint  and I also have a background in art so I’m pretty good with colors  I usually love helping customers with picking a color because most of the time  my customers respect my input and come back happy with the result  Last week I had the opposite  This is how the conversation went   WL  weird lady M  me   WL  “Can you make me a gold color like this ”She holds up a can of Rustoleum metallic paint  which is very shiny and not flat at all M  “I’m sorry miss but we only do flat colors  we just are unable to mix any metallics in the wall paints  “WL  “I didn’t say I wanted metallic  I just want a gold color ”M   is taken aback  “uh  well you can look at our color samples and see what’s closest to that gold ”WL  “i want you to help me find a color close to it because it’s your job ”at this point I’m just wanting to get the color made and boot her to the register  So I start looking at colors and suggesting some for her  she shoots every one down  M  “I think this is the closest I can find to the can you showed me”WL  I don’t want what the can is  I want gold M          “… ok  so you want something a bit more on the warm yellowish side ”WL  “I’ve already said I wanted gold a million times ”M   visibly frustrated  “can you show me roughly what you mean when you say you want gold ”  WL   picks out literally a very yellow shade and flicks it at me M  “is this the color you want then ”WL  “yes  it’s the closest thing you have to gold ”  it really isn’t but art is subjective so whatever M   makes her the sample as she watches closely  she sees me put in literally the exact name and sample she handed me  I put a dot of paint on top of the can and hand it to her  “Anything else I can help you with ”WL   inspects the top of the can for ten seconds  “This is not gold ” M  “Ma’am you chose that color yourself ”WL  “yes but this is not gold ”M  “but the paint is going to look exactly the same as the sample you provided ” WL  “I don’t care that it’s the same  It’s the wrong color ” M  “well you’re the one who picked it  so it’s not my fault if you don’t think you picked the right color  I will make you another one if you can find a sample you are sure you want ”WL   scoffs and looks at the colors a little bit longer  before handing me a slightly darker sample M  “are you sure this is the color you want  The paint is going to be exactly the same color and sheen of this sample ”WL  “yes  yes I’m sure  Just make my paint so I can get out of here already ”M   same process  sample is done  WL   inspects it again “This isn’t the right color ”M   finally snaps  “Ma’am  I asked you if this is the color you wanted  you said yes  twice  I told you the color will look EXACTLY like the sample  what on earth could possibly be wrong with this sample ” WL  “it’s not the same as the sample  it’s too yellow ” M   opens the can  dots the sample paper with the paint  and dries it  right in front of her  It blends in perfectly as it should WL   silence M  “I’m not wasting any more paint or time  Either take the paint or leave ”WL   grumbles and pays for the paint up front  This entire battle was over a   pint of paint,3301,622

151,onu566,1,0,The time an angry customer was   right but it’s wasn’t our fault So this story begins in a “lovely” store that rhymes with ballmart  At this point in time I had worked there for about  months in the electronics section  As some of you might know stores like to move product around for seemingly no reason and this was one of those times  We were moving our movie sections around  Think comedy moving to the thriller section and kids movies moved to another location  Either way this was a long annoying and somewhat pointless process  Now I would help wherever but our queen of movies  as I used to call her  is W  She was amazing and the fastest even though at this point she was a great grandma and one of the sweetest people I have ever had the joy to work with  Well during this large scale re arrange one particular movie was placed in its new home  The movie in question was Roots and it’s new home still had old signs  we were waiting for the replacements to come on the midnight truck  that read “comedies” We had one customer notice this and this gentleman was very very VERY angry  I do not blame him it’s completely understandable  However one would expect that seeing empty shelves and boxes full of movies all over the department that he would realize that we were not going to leave the movie there  Now Ms  W was a kind woman and   of the time she could have a customer laughing by the time they left even if they were screaming when they came in  Well this customer took her southern accent to mean that she purposely placed the movie there and was racist herself  At this point the customer is stepping closer to poor W and once I finished ringing out my customer I called for my manager H And went over to try and calm the guy down and to put some distance between him and W  Now in my area we aren’t super diverse regarding ethnicity  H was our only African American manager at the time  Once H finally arrived he pulled W aside to assess the situation and mr customer was bashing me the entire time  I mostly just agreed with him and kept trying to explain what was happening and why it was there  I even showed him where the movies would be and that the signs would be changed that night once they were delivered  H finally takes over  W goes to the back to collect herself and I helped the rubber necking customers that were in the area  H finally got the customer calm enough to listen to reason and ended up giving him a movie for free for the trouble W went to the customer after the fact to make sure he didn’t actually think she was racist   She had tears in her eyes because she didn’t want him to think she was racist   And he just walked away completely giving her the cold shoulder On my next break I bought W a coke and her favorite candy  I reminded her that she isn’t what one person says and she knows who she is and everyone that matters knows what kind of person she is and that’s what matters,2958,553

156,onftvk,1,39,Sorry lady  I don’t control taxes Yesterday I was at the register at the shoe store I work at and this woman brought in a pair of shoes that she wanted to exchange for a bigger size  Ok  no problem  I ask her for the receipt and she says she lost it  Again  not a problem  I ask her for her drivers license as per our no receipt return policy  she gives it to me  and I manually input the price of the shoes she was returning I scan the pair that she wanted to buy  and the difference is    because of taxes  She seemed confused  so I explained to her that we can’t do an even exchange because of taxes  She replies with “but I live in  neighboring county  and the taxes are the same there” I explain to her that the tax is dependent on where she bought the shoes  my store is part of a large chain with locations all over the country   and since we don’t have the receipt  we can’t verify whether or not she paid tax because we don’t know which store she purchased them from  Therefore  we could only refund her the listed price of the shoes  and she would still have to pay tax because my location taxes every purchase  I told her that I was very sorry for the confusion but I had no control over this  She proceeded to say “the  dollars isn’t the problem  you’re the problem ”At this point I was both shocked and pissed off  and I asked her what I did wrong  I don’t remember exactly what she said  but I think it was something along the lines of “I live in  neighboring county  where taxes are the same” I continued to try and explain that where she lives has nothing to do with how much she gets taxed  and that I also have no say in the matter and there was nothing I could do  She inserted her card but continued to rant about how I was the problem  I’m not perfect at my job but I’m pretty sure I’m very much not the problem in this case lol,1860,362

158,on6nts,1,34,Called an idiot because I was doing my job I work at a convenience store  and there are so many times where a customer comes in  gets  dollars worth of items and pats with a hundred dollar bill Now we can never keep enough change in the tills for something like that as a robbery prevention  as most dont want a bunch of  dollar bills and coins  So we ask if they have anything smaller or if they can pay with card  if not we inform them that we must take money out of the safe  and that it will take two minutes if the change is over  dollars as we can only take out  dollars at a time and must wait  minutes for the next tube of bills Some get mad  but most understand  but the one I had to deal with was another story It was the end of a shift and I had to count the money in the tills and and all the tubes of money in the safe  that means no tubes can go in or out until I finish counting  meanwhile my coworker helped the customers So a guy came in and bought I say  dollars worth and brought out a  dollar bill  now at that point we had no large bills as they were all in the safe  so my coworker asked the usual questions  and then I informed him that because I am counting the money  it will be a longer wait until I count the safe   So he got angry saying that  He couldnt wait and that his drinks would melt  he bought slushies I told him that he didnt have to wait long as I was almost finished  but that was still to long and said that  I will take a drink from this slushie and leaving  I apologized saying that it is a robbery prevention to not keep large bills in the till and that we couldnt take money out of the aafe while I was counting  his only response was  no you are an idiot for not knowing how to do your job  and left The thing is  it would have added an extra  minutes to him waiting so we could get him all his change   No idea if he was in a rush  but so many times I cant help but ask myself  why couldnt thet go to the bank to get smaller bills  and why so thet think convenience stores just have the money ready for them,2090,425

161,omrbhu,1,47,When the return policy is TOO lenient So back in April of this year I was working at this one retail store at a mall near my college  The return policy was that items could be returned within  days of purchase  it was fine if you didn’t have your receipt  and we could even bring up purchases for return through the card used in the purchase  Most items that got returned would be damaged out mainly if they were clearly worn or pose a risk in regards to sanitation  for example  beauty items returned always get damaged out  Regular clothing items  that don’t have visible wear don’t get damaged out though I’m gonna focus on a rather interesting return I had to process  So one day this woman comes in wanting to return a bra  and she didn’t have the receipt on her  I noticed the tags had been removed so I couldn’t do a no receipt return  However  we  one of my managers helped me  were able to trace the purchase through her credit card  and she was within  day of purchase so she was definitely eligible for return  She was able to get her money back of course  but I noticed some flaws in the bra when it was returned  She had clearly worn the bra  as it had pit stains and was kinda smelly  I already knew the bra had to be damaged out  As I was walking to the main register  I was ringing at a register in a separate part of the store  one of my managers asked what happened with the bra and looked disgusted  and I explained how it was clearly worn  and could no longer be sold  and another manager agreed that it had to be damaged out  So I filled out a damage tag  and tossed it in with the other damaged items Ultimately I don’t recommend you do what the lady who made the return did  If a store has a lenient return policy  they will likely accept items that have been washed,1805,344

163,omk0ix,1,34,Woman thinks Im being discriminating for calling her out for cutting in line I work at a store that has a food court  People line up in one long line and wait to be called up to place their order from either me or another cashier  Ive made it a habit to make eye contact and wave over the next customer because sometimes there is confusion on who is supposed to go next  There are times where people accidentally cut in front of others and I always tell them that they werent the next person in line and to go back to wait their turn  Most of the time  the person is apologetic and apologizes to both me and the person they cut in front of  Other times  they get defensive  but in the end they go back to their spot in the line  Well  today was a bit different  I was finishing up helping a customer and called for the next customer to my window  For reference  I have two windows and my register is in the middle of both windows  A man approaches my left window and a woman approaches my right window  I knew that the man was next because I saw the woman walk straight from her spot in the line to my right  window  disregarding the man who was waiting in the front of the line  The woman speaks up first before I could tell her to go back in line  The following dialogue was translated from SpanishWoman  Hello  two smoothies please  Me  Im sorry maam  but were you next Woman  What do you mean  Of course I was next Me  Well  it seems that gentleman over there was next Woman  I was waiting in line A woman from the line pipes up and says   Yes  she was waiting in line in front of me  Its alright   I nod my head to that woman and turn to look at the man on my left window  The man and I speak to each other in English  Man  Its alright  you can go ahead and help her first  I notice that the man was counting out his change anyway so I go to attend to the woman  She repeats her order  this time more harshly  Me  Before I start your order  I need to scan a membership card to ring you up Woman  You need a wait Me  Your membership card  please Woman  My goodness     Rolling her eyes  she waves over someone from outside the line  shouting at them to hurry up with the card  I check back on my left window to see if the man was done counting his change  but he isnt  Man  Its alright  go ahead and help her out Me  Oh  I was but Im waiting for her to bring her membership card Finally  a younger woman comes to the line asking what the line cutter woman needed  Woman  She needs to see a membership card to take my order  apparently  Younger woman  Oh okay  here it is I finally scan their card and as Im scanning it the line cutter woman turns to the younger woman and speaks loudly so I can obviously hear Woman  Lets never come here again  It seems that the employees like to discriminate against certain customers Me  Excuse me  Woman  You like to discriminate against people  dont you  Me  I dont understand  I asked you if you were next because I saw that you werent  Im not discriminating you  She waves her hand at me and just tells me her order again  I punch it in and just decide to let it go  but she decides to keep pushing my buttons  Woman  I hope she gives us good service  but she probably wont  Lets not come here again The thing that annoyed me the most about this woman was that she wasnt looking me in the face when she said this  Its like she didnt have the balls to say it straight to me  but wanted to seem tough in front of the younger woman  I cut her off from saying anything else and ask her if thats all she wants to order  The younger woman responds for her  I walk away to put the order together and my coworker asks if I need any help  I ask her to help the kind gentleman waiting patiently in the other window while I help the line cutter woman  I then return to the window with the womans items  Woman  Next time  dont discriminate against us Me  I wasnt being discriminatory  I asked you if you were next and you werent yet I still attended to you  I also need a membership card from every customer  not just you  Woman  Whatever  just dont do it next time  Me  You know what  Whatever  I know what I did wasnt discriminating you  Theres no point in arguing with you  NEXT PLEASE She walks away from my window  but not before saying one last thing before she left Woman  Dont discriminate Some people  man,4445,827

165,omdx99,1,28,Spider removal Short story but I still laugh about this  I worked in a big box store and there was a woman around my age who worked in cosmetics  She was very nice  but would frequently page people for help with even the smallest tasks One evening I was sitting in the break room with a few people from around the store  including the guy who was on “store standards”  cleaning carry outs cart retrieval  that shift and the girl from cosmetics started paging him  He ignored it because he was on his break  but she persisted  finally calling the break room to talk to him she said she needed a “spider removal”  Our store had recently gotten those “spider” locks for expensive items that require a special key to open  so he assumed it was that and went to go deal with it  He comes back several minutes later laughing the girl from cosmetics didn’t need a spider tag removed…there was a spider crawling across the cosmetics desk and she panicked and wanted someone to remove it for her,989,174
166,olwpms,1,148,Clever Thief Almost Got Away with   Worth of Merchandise This happened three days ago and Im still surprised I was working one of the registers on a pretty steady day  Not busy but not slow as pond water either  While I rang up a few customers  I noticed two managers  the head cashiers  talking and looking both concerned and amused  When there werent any customers waiting  I went to satisfy my curiosity when I noticed a cart stocked with lots of expensive power tools and batteries for said tools  My first thought was a customer forgot their wallet in their car and went to get it  happens more often than you think  or a customer went to grab something else before checking out Welp  no such thing According to the head cashier  HC  s female  who was watching self checkout at the time  a male customer came up to scan those items  There was another customer doing the same while the HC watched  but she noticed something while the guy was scanning things Now  every time something is scanned for purchase at any register  an image of it appears on the screen  The guy appeared to be scanning the power tools and batteries  but the head cashier noticed everything he had scanned on the screen didnt match the products he had  The screen showed several lines of the same small bit of PVC pipe  which was worth a buck and change  and this guy didnt have ANY PVC piping in his cart whatsoever The HC noticed this and quickly gathered the courage to properly approach the customer as he was nearly done  She told him  very professionally  there was an issue because he was scanning as they didnt match the image on the screen  The customer feigned ignorance while the HC proceeded to scan one of the items he  already scanned  and sure enough  the correct item appeared on the screen with the correct triple digit price tag  She proceeded to remove what he scanned already and scanned every item correctly  Suddenly the customer is surprised and says he cant afford all that  The HC does the  Do you want to save some money by signing up for the company credit card   bit  to which he declines and leaves empty handed Turns out the guy had a little barcode sticker ON HIS FINGER for PVC and scanned it to make it seem like he was scanning the other items  If the HC hadnt paid proper attention  the dude wouldve walked out of the store with almost   worth of merchandise  Other managers were informed of the incident and the ASMs  assistant store managers  gave the HC props for handling the situation so well We have some wayward youths working at our store who have a bad habit of neglecting their duties in favor of socializing with each other  This scenario should serve as a learning experience for them and future employees to be more vigilant As messed up as the situation was  I was impressed at the thiefs clever approach,2868,500

169,olhsp6,1,113,No  sir  I cannot use an online code for in store purchases  I work in an auto shop  and recently became a manager there  My boss had warned me that the higher you go in retail  it gets harder to deal with customers  I thought he was joking because I’ve pretty much had pretty chill and downright friendly customers for the majority of my time working there But this one customer  Goddamn  He actually made my blood boil  I’m not a violent or angry person by any means  but he was actually testing my patience First he walks in the store  and shows me the product he needs on his phone  He had already visited the website  so he already knew what he was looking for  All right  cool  This’ll be a quick transaction  So I get the product for him  and go to my register  As I’m about to scan it  he hits me with this Customer  I’d like to use this code  shows me an online code on his phone Me   stares at him  Are you planning to buy the product online Customer  No I want to use the code in here Me  I can’t use that code  You can only use it online Customer  But it’s your store  It’s the same thing  it’s your website  Me  I’m aware that the website and our store have the same name  But we have no control over whatever happens online  Customer  Where’s the manager Me   giddy on the inside to finally use the quote  I am the manager  And I’m telling you  that this code is not going to work in the store Customer  Well why can’t you just honor it Me   stares at him again  Honor what  There’s nothing to honor  because this is an online code  And you are currently in the store  In store purchases and online purchases are completely separate things  It’s not going to work Customer  I didn’t see you type it in Me   never taking my eyes off him  proceeds to type in the code  move the monitor so he can see it  I hit enter  and nothing happens  Customer  … Well something’s wrong with your computers  because the other stores have done this for me Me   almost losing my temper  There’s no way the other stores have done this  The code is supposed to be used online  so if they were to type in the computer at the store  they would’ve gotten the same result as me  Nothing Customer   makes a big huff and finally goes into his email to pull up a coupon that can be used in the store   I’ll be calling corporate about this Me  You do that I relayed the entire interaction with this guy to my boss  and he laughed his ass off  and even his boss lost it when he told him I’m all good now  but man  that customer was not listening to a word I said,2590,470
170,olho8w,1,71,That time I kinda went off on a “customer” Calling him a customer is being generous  and this took place earlier this week  My coworker was in the restroom and I had a small line  Nothing big just three people with a few things  A fourth one skips the line to ask me if we have any more six packs of a specific beer  I tell him I’m not sure but I can definitely check the cooler for him once I finish  He walks off and I finish the line quick  I didn’t see the guy anywhere and figured he hit the bathroom so I go ahead and dip into the cooler  Except when I open the cooler door  the guy walks out carrying his beers  Now I assume  and I genuinely hope  all of you know why that is a BIG NO NO  Customers don’t go into the back room  they don’t go into the walk in cooler  I try to shrug it off  retain that customer service tone and tell him that he cant go back here  if he had been patient I told him I was going to go in it and get him his beer  His response  ”Whatever”  and an attempt to shoulder past me  That burned any chance he had  I told him to hand me the beer  he stared at me dumbly so I said louder and firmer that he is to hand me the beer  Then I tore into him  “Non employees are  not  to go into the coolers  You were told to wait  Because of that you need to leave the store  Now ”As you can guess he complained and then said he wasn’t leaving without his beer  I straight up told him as he was told to leave his refusal meant he was trespassing  I WILL be calling the police if this continues  He needs to walk his ass out the door either on his own or brought out by cops  I will not be serving him in the future and if I see him in the store on any future I will be kicking his ass out upon sight  Then he had the gall to claim that what I was doing wasn’t right  that   he hadn’t done anything to warrant being kicked out    I pointedly told him that going into employee areas can and will get customers kicked out of the store  I then pointedly went to the office as it was closer to get the phone  This dude swore at me and stormed out yelling that he would call my boss and called me a bitch  After that I threw some carts to block the entry to the back room coolers  and left a note for other staff that hey  people are going into the coolers  And one for the boss to please get the cooler door fixed  the handle broke clean off three weeks ago  so we can lock it Wtf is these ppls thought process tho  to think that hey it’s perfectly fine to  walk into the coolers,2517,506

172,okyuwb,1,24,The day the register froze So  idk if it’s like this at other places but the gas station I work at only keeps one register up after   Partly because it’s slower during the last  hours and partly because there’s only one person working after   Usually that isn’t an issue  Occasionally I’ll have people complain  or outright ignore the “register closed” signs to try and scan their items themselves cause they don’t wanna wait in line  A few months back while handling the last couple of customers for the night  the retail gods decided to make things harder  I only had the one register up  store closed in  minutes and I had a line of three  The lady and her son that I was helping was trying to buy several cases of beer  Usually no issue  so long as the parent pays for and carries said alcohol  Well  while she was doing this  she decided half way through the transaction  paying via card  that she wanted to add smokes and one of our single oz cans of bud to the purchase  So I hit cancel  rang those up  started the transaction over  then she cancels it on her end because she didn’t think the price was right  I guess the system didn’t like it being canceled so much so quickly because after she ran her card a third time  the register outright froze  the system froze completely  The only thing I could do would be to completely reboot the register  Which takes  minutes  and by that point it was a minute until we closed  I could do nothing for her purchase on this register  and I couldn’t jump on the other register as it was down for the night  I’d have to do a shift change on it  which as a closer I was not trained to do and would not be able to do  I felt bad for the customers as I wouldn’t be able to help anyone  none of the would be able to make a purchase   Most were understanding  One of my regulars bitches a little about not being able to buy her Nattys  The ones at the register however insured they be able to take home the beer and smokes they bought  I explained that because the register froze it is unlikely their csrd went through and I can’t let them walk out with almost   with or merchandise without confirmation their card even went through  They kept insisting and so I decided screw it  here is what we will do  I had them write their name and number  and if the register unfreezes before I left and the payment went through I’ll call them so they can pick the stuff up  Otherwise morning will call them if it went through  Their card did not go through in the end  I felt bad and understood where they were coming from but also I don’t think there’s a store that would let you leave with that much unpaid stuff if the system froze,2692,510

179,ojzqco,1,16,I wanted to give you flowers  but you stole my money Hey everyone i hope your doing great  English is not my native language  but i also have no respect for it so i dont really care about mistakes haha  Also Im not from the US and taxes are included in the prices we have  amp  xB I recently started working at a local grocery store  its actually a big chain  where I work  hours a week split into two shifts with  hours  So I could be working monday   tuesday one week and the next week friday   saturday  So if you come to see me specifically for whatever reason the chances Im actually there arent that high and this story takes place on a thursday my second shift that week and i wasnt working until the thursday the next week   Also we have those automatic things that move the producets from a bit back of the line to the front but i dont even know what its called in my native language  Well a few weeks ago this wome came up to my register  I already have the first product in my hand  ready to scan when she proceeds to tell me she forgot her wallet and cant pay  She would have to go home and get her wallet  that would take her about min  My shift was another hour and we dont have an official company rule but everyone working there just rings up  is that how you say it  well i scanned all her products and told the register she payed  and she left the things at my register I go on with my shift and already kinda forgot about her when she comes to my register again with another beer and some flowers she also wants to buy  I get someone authorised to deal with cancelling her first purchase so my balance is right in the end  Until they come I tell the flowerlady the price something like  €  which she knew because i told her before she left but now she says it cant be that high blabla and she puts a € bill on this thing that moves the products infront of her about an armlenght away from me holding two more in her hands  My supervisor comes and then recalculates the price while we wait for her  The flowerlady still saying its not the right price  but surprise it was  who guessed the register could be right    Well now she wants to pay but the bill she but down in front of her isnt there anymore and she accuses me and my supervisor of taking it  She gets kinda agressive in her tone  demanding that we write down our names  what we do  and in a kinda sad and dissapointed tone she says something like I wanted to give you those flowers for being nice but now i cant do this anymore  like i care about some ugly and tiny bouquet of flowers bought from a grocery store   After paying she wants to leave but she still has the flowers and the beer and I remind her she has to pay those aswell  what she does and then she leaves  On a side note the customer after her  who patiently waited for about  minutes  goes on a little rant about the flowerlady saying he knows her and she always makes problems So I go on with my live and actually have a good laugh telling this story to my mother  I go in the next week for my first shift  it was an evening shift  and because there was a big turn over of cashiers my register wasnt ready yet  Well as Im waiting my supervisor  a difrrent one  tells me that some Lady left flowers for me yesterday  so wednesday  and she wrote an apology on a reciept paper   I wish I knew what turned in this Ladies mind that she realised noone stole her money and what in the world made her think coming back and actually buying me flowers was a good idea but you know i appreciate the gesture and till this day my supervisor and I laugh about it   Those flowers are currently dying in my appartment  but I actually tried taking care of them haha,3728,717
180,ojz7dw,1,6,Stay happy  friend   So  this one guy was a tax exempt  which means I need to get a manager to scan a card to enable the tax exempt stuff  So I do that  and I’m checking the guy’s items  no big deal  But then the TE guy  tax exempt  says he needs some cigarettes  So  I go to help him get some cigs  It took like  minutes  he was buying in bulk  When we got back  the TE guy struck up a conversation with the guy behind him  he apologized  said he did this once a month  blah blah  And then he was getting ready to pay  the TE guy was   and the guy behind him said  “Oh  what now  is the check gonna bounce or something ” And I thought this was just a joke  you know  like friendly banter  And I think the TE guy thought it was a joke  too  So the TE guy said  after he paid with a credit card   “All right  bye  stay happy  friend ” In a real friendly way  But then guy behind him says  “F  CK OFF ”   The TE guy  who was chill  said  “Oh my God ” and left  So then I started checking out the guy who said f off  Ill refer to him as Karen   I was doing my thing  and I scanned one case of water bottles in his cart  and I moved it  cause I wanted to see if the other case in the cart was the same or a different brand  Turns out  it was the same  But Karen said  “Oh  just scan the top one twice ” In a really exasperated voice  So I did  He then added  “Is it your first day or somethin’ ” And I responded  “I am new ”  which is true  I started like a week ago   And he said  “I can see that ” And then I continued  One of my managers came over  because my light was flashing from the TE guy  we click a button to make our lights flash on and off in order to get a managers attention if we need help   and asked if anything was wrong  Karen chimed in and said  “He’s fine  but the customer’s not  This service is terrible  I usually go to   other store    but I decided to try   this store    and I’m never coming back  I’m sticking with   other store   ” and the manager was like “Okay sir  I’m sorry sir ” in a voice that sounded like she wanted to say “All right you scrub  just shut up and get your receipt you moron”  so I dont think Im going to get in trouble  And then I gave Karen his receipt and then he left  Good riddance,2241,452
181,ojyoks,1,73,Don’t judge a book    So tonight I had a very nice family come to the register  Mother  Daughter  a maybe  year old and a toddler the mother was holding  Told them to give me a second cuz I had to show my boss something down the aisle  in view of the register   I come back and cash them out noticing a birthday balloon they placed at the end of my belt was missing and in its place was an empty package for skull caps  Manager went and watched the cameras  He came back laughing  Apparently in the thirty seconds I was gone the mother ditched the empty package that she had hiding under the toddler and shoved the balloons in her purse  They paid for everything else and were really nice which is why he was laughing  The total of what they stole vs what they paid     stolen but they paid for the   worth of stuff  Never assume a wholesome family is just a nice innocent customer,888,170

183,ojqj7f,1,116,“Honey  is this really all you have ” Alright  so  I used to work at a gas station  I worked the overnight shift  and just know this I’m ’  I’m tiny  and I’m working overnights by myself  This was back in November of   Around am  a man comes in with a mask on and his hood up  I looked up at him and he said  “Do you have any Marlboros ” I thought it was weird he asked that  because there’s how many kinds behind me you can see  So I say back  “yes  what kind ” He seemed taken back by my question for some reason  I thought he was maybe on drugs  because it happens  He then says  “Oh  um  Marlboro reds ” I turned around and grabbed the cigarettes off of the shelf behind me  Just as I was about to scan the cigarettes  the man suddenly came behind the register  He stood behind me with something pressing against right my side  “Give me your money honey ” he said to me  I felt so scared and froze for a moment  I opened my register and while doing so I attempted to press the panic button about five times  The nearby police station is literally like  mins away  “Are you trying to call the cops ” He asked me  In that moment  I didn’t know if he actually saw me press the button or not  but it scared me even more  I didn’t know if he would hurt me  I didn’t know what he had against my side  This man had the audacity to ask me  “Honey  is this all the money you have ” I was so dumbfounded by this question  Even if I had anymore money I wouldn’t tell you  It’s the middle of the night that was your first mistake buddy  Suddenly he starts rushing me out of nowhere  I ended up giving him all the bills out of my register which only came to  something  After he takes the money he runs off and I called the cops  Camera footage shows him dropping a knife  I was so terrified and in shock I didn’t realize it fell  I just wanted him to get off of me and leave me alone,1887,372
184,ojodn3,1,10,There are such things as dumb questions  I work in a couple souvenir shops in a little mountain town  This is my first retail job in about  years  and I dont feel like Ive gotten as many head scratchers at past retail jobs as I have this summer  Most of them are silly things that I just either get annoyed with answering over and over or questions that I would never have thought to be asked  Here are a few of them  People asking me if they can put stickers on their truck  Its a damn sticker  itll stick to any smooth surface  I dont give a hoot where you put it  People asking me if a fanny pack is in fact a fanny pack and how to wear it  Yes  it is a fanny pack  and once again I do not care  wear it however you want  One person even bought one only after I confirmed that fanny packs are currently  trendy   I have also been asked how to wear a regular backpack several times   People asking me if I have anymore of a certain shirt thats on display in the front window  No  we just like to taunt everyone with what they could have  What kind of store advertises things in the window and doesnt have them for sale in the store   People asking me if my dog is real  If you cant tell a real dog from a statue  I just dont know what to tell you   Unrelated to the store itself  more so to the town Im in  People asking me if there are bears in town  Were in the heart of the rockies  if bears being here is a surprise to you  please dont venture too far from main street  On the same note  I have also been asked how somebody could find a mountain lion  and at what elevation deer become elk  Seriously   People asking me if we still have a product that the store sold several years ago  when there are clearly none on the shelf  Maybe its just if you have worked retail  but that one should be pretty obvious  I feel  People asking me if they can take a product out of the store so they can find the person they want to show it to  Correct me if Im wrong  but I dont think ANY store would let you walk outside with an unpaid for product   Shakes head Thats all for now  Again  mostly harmless questions  just with seemingly  to me  obvious answers that I have to answer almost every day  Anyway  hope you guys enjoyed reading  and best of luck with the rest of the summer season in the US,2327,445
185,ojl78a,1,8,Definitely not trying to steal Having a lot of these stories recently  must be due to the tourist season Guy in the store for a loooong time  Almost an hour  At one point the only guy in the store  Spending a lot of time in one corner at the front by vacuums  Refusing help when asked  At one point  grabs a Bluetooth speaker  heads straight for that same corner  My colleague tells me that to intercept as I can see him walking quickly towards the door  Apparently he couldnt get the spiders  alarms  off the boxes  so he wouldve set off the door alarms  so I guess he must be quick I intercept   Hi  I can pop those through for you   Not a happy face but not an outwardly annoyed one either Scanning through his items  I say  you can get a guarantee with the speaker  Ill just need some details for the system  I assume that youre a mister      this is a joke I throw in with a smile to all obviously male presenting customers and I almost always get a laugh  not today Customer   WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU NEED MY DETAILS   THE RECEIPT IS ENOUGH  Me  taken aback by him going   instantly  but staying calm   The system is just asking for details incase something goes wrong  so its easier for us to find your details  If youre not happy with that  though  Ill just pop down Mr X   Cue another minute or so of shouting about us not needing his details  his aggression being met with a smile from me because hes has to pay nearly £ for products he hoped to get for free  He definitely didnt look suspicious screaming over being asked for his name  though,1593,288
186,ojij5k,1,10,Gift boxes are not complicated Customer asks for large gift boxes  I let him know the largest we carry is the kind for clothes  He kinda looks at me weird and then asks where they are  I point him to the correct aisle and go on my merry way  Few minutes later  he comes back and says he couldnt find them  Im a little concerned because they are in a spot that makes them easy to find  but whatever  I go to the aisle and point them out  He stares at them like he doesnt believe me   Do these have the top and bottom   At this point I realize that he thought the boxes would already be made  while these were flat and needed to be unfolded  I explain that to him  He still has a look that says he doesnt really believe me  but I guess he relents  Then he asks   can you wrap them   To me it sounded like he was asking if these boxes had the capability to be wrapped so I was like  yeah the gift wrap is right here  Then hes like   do  you  wrap them   And Im like  oh no we dont offer gift wrapping services  Once again he looks at me like Im the stupid one   Well  Ill buy it  will you wrap it    Now Im getting angry  We do not offer gift wrapping services  He is still giving me this stupid look so I just ask if he needed anything else and walk away when he said no lolAll of this just gave me the feeling that this grown ass man has never given a gift before in his life,1391,278
187,ojejxa,1,105,Man leaves after I ask if he wants to pay before I make his order I work in a store where we also sell sandwiches  This guy came in and asked me to make him one  Okay  no problem  There is someone else in the store who usually makes them  but she was busy so I said Id make it instead  which I can do with no problems   I then asked the costumer if he wanted to pay before I made his order since thats usually easier for both me and the costumer  He responded saying that if making a sandwich is too hard for me to do hell just go get it somewhere else  I was stunned since I just said I would make it for him  Anyway he left and I wish him good luck with trying to find another shop that sells sandwiches at this hour,722,149
188,ojb2ib,1,17,TV that smells So a couple of years ago when I was working at retail  there was this old guy around  that I sold him a TV and the extra warranty that the store provided He comes the next day claiming that his TV has a weird smell   my manager happened to be at the same floor and he heard us so he came and said the same thing I said to the customer if he could bring it at the store so we can check it out  he said sure and then asked me if I could show him another TV similar to that which I replied with yes in my mind I was thinking that he probably wants to see one because of the extra warranty which basically provides you with another TV while your TV is getting fixed  So I went ahead I showed him the TV and he randomly kneels and sniffs the tv from the bottom up and said yes this one doesnt smell I was frozen I didnt know how to react I was trying my hardest not to laugh but a smile escaped  and not only that he told yeah smell it   it has no smell he was waiting me to smell it so I went ahead did a quick sniff I watch behind me and I see my manager and the cashiers laughing The guy left shortly after that I kept asking the other coworkers if he ever came back or brought the TV which they replied with a no I just hope it was not a fetish I have more stories to share  I just found out this sub reddit I might post them if you guys want,1363,281
189,oj8okx,1,9,Cash register story So I just started a new job in a grocery store and basically my only job is to attend the only cash register  This isn’t my first job  and I have ran registers before  So on my very first day  I had this guy walk up with like a pack of gummies and some other items  He sits the gummies down and mumbles something under his breath  So I ring his stuff up and when I get to his gummies I ask if he wants them or if he wants them in a bag and he just looks at and yells “no I said I want to eat them”  Now my hearing isn’t that good and I know he mumbled anyway so I just ignored it  I don’t remember his total  but for the sake of the story  we’ll just say it was    He hands me a  and a nickel  And I give him the change the register tells me  which obviously included pennies  He looks at me and goes no this isn’t right  and I go “excuse me ” And he said “I gave you that nickel so I wouldn’t have any pennies  I swear you damn kids can’t do math or anything now a days  I can do math in my head” I didn’t say anything and just took his pennies and rounded it up and gave him a nickel  and I didn’t say anything and just kept looking down the whole time because I’m a relatively shy person  But if your change already wasn’t a multiple of  then adding a nickel wouldn’t change that  This is essentially just me ranting the story,1357,280
190,oj5na3,1,89,No one greeted me when I walked in I used to work at a home goods store that was known for its imports that has since gone bankrupt My store’s location was closing permanently due to our landlord not renewing the lease and this particular story takes place during the last month the store was open This particular night there were three of us working  me  another associate  and the sales lead  It was the closing shift and the store was closing early because we had reduced hours since the store was going out of business  The store is almost empty of inventory since we’re so close to closing and you can basically see whoever walks in from anywhere in the store  Company policy normally is that someone stays near the front of the store to man the cash register and be able to greet any customer that walks in Well tonight the store was surprisingly busy  there were about  customers in the store and they all wanted to ask questions and have their hands held through choosing things and we had to start closing duties And at this point  when the other associate had walked to the back to start closing duties and me and the sales lead were both actively helping other customers  in walks Brenda I see her enter the store but can’t greet her as I’m talking to another customer but I make a mental note to follow up with her  The customer I was helping had a ton of questions and I didn’t get away from them for another ten minutes after Brenda walked in  At that point Brenda is looking at a display by the cash register so I walk up and ask her how she’s doing and she informs me she’s ready to check out No problem  I can do that  We made pleasant small talk while I rung her out and explain that everything is final sale and my sales lead was able to come up and help bag things about halfway through the transaction to help speed things up  As we come to the end of the transaction Brenda starts talking about how it’s a shame the store is closing then sighs and says “but it’s no surprise I guess since no one even greeted me tonight when I came in ”I was taken completely off guard and kind of froze but started to try to apologize and she doubled down and said “oh no  It’s true none of you bothered to try to talk to me when I walked in ”I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was something to the effect of “I’m sorry I was with another customer but we do make our best efforts to greet everyone but sometimes it’s just not possible ” Then she replied with something snarky and left It made me super mad though because the store was literally closing and we were all going to be jobless in a month but go forbid we don’t say hi to you when you walk in to our bare bones store,2713,509

192,oj0kjp,1,56,Customer weirdly hostile to cashier  this woman came I last night while I was training a new employee  and right off the bat it was clear she didn’t like me  She and coworker were both Native American and I am not  idk if that had anything to do with why she hated me on sight but immediately acted like she was BFFs with coworker  Neither coworker or I had ever met her before that night  She was short and curt when I said the usual hello  but she was very bubbly and friendly with my coworker  She had loudly asked how much a pack of x brand smokes cost while I was helping a customer before her so coworker grabbed the smokes for me to scan when I was done  when I rang up the cigs and told her the total she just went “Huh  What ” She hadn’t been paying attention so I told her that x type of x brand is so and so amount   ”Oh   Okay ” And she immediately pulled out a   so I had to stop her and gesture to her case of beer  ask if she was paying for that separately  the woman just scoffed and put it down  angrily going a saying how shes paying for them together in that “what are you  an idiot ” tone that all retail workers are familiar with  I’m biting my tongue and just thinking in what world does a  pack of beer and cigs come up to under    Plus when would I have scanned it  She had it cradled in her arms the entire time Then she looked to the kid I was training  telling him that since I’m so slow he should take over  while laughing like it’s a funny joke  neither me or coworker laughed   Then once her attention was on me as I gave her the new total  she had this awful scowl and demanded a lighter  the lighter rack was right by her hand on the counter  She demanded the price of a lighter  eve though the price tags were right in front of her  I gave her the price range anyway  She didn’t like that answer and demanded the cheapest  Didn’t even let me answer before she grabbed one and threw it on the counter  During that time I had grabbed a can of beer the customer before her had decided against buying and left on the counter  handed it to coworker asking him to put it back on the shelf  Woman exploded “THATS NOT MINE ” as if I was ringing it up  I know it’s not yours  ma’am  That’s why i asked coworker to put it back on the shelf  But that went in one ear and out the other for her because she angrily reiterated that she’s not paying for that since she didn’t ask for it  Again  i tell her this had nothing to do with her purchases and wasn’t being rung up  She scoffs and says she’s not paying for someone else’s beer  I ignore it and force the topic elsewhere by giving her the final total for her three things  It’s like over  and she accuses me of ringing it up wrong because it’s too expensive  So I read off whats been rung up and how much each item was  Beer and smokes aren’t cheap  sorry to break it to you  She paid  made some loud comments to coworker about how our boss needs to hire people who know how to work checkout  and left  All throughout it she would ignore me for periods to chat with coworker telling him jokes or other small talk things and then get angry when she talked to me  It was weird af to me,3177,620

194,oilw7u,1,81,No  Im not giving you another free giveaway  So I work at your average grocery store in Canada  its moderately busy and I commonly work at the self check out station or behind the customer service desk  A few days ago  I happened to be working for the self checkout station  I was standing by the customer service desk when an older lady  OL  stops in front of me on her way out  For context  our store occasionally gives away a certain item if you spend over a certain amount  This week  it was a box of snacks  like oeros  ect  OL  Is that your giveaway for this week for spending over x amount  Me  Yes  I can grab you one if youd like  OL  Well  I dont want it  Can you do a substitution At this point  Im thinking that she may have dietary restrictions or something  Weve done substitutions for people who want a vegetarian option before  I was wrong  Me   Are you thinking of a substitution for dietary reasons She looks super confused  even with her mask on  OL  No  Im asking for another option because I dont like that giveaway  Dont you have anything else Me  Unfortunately we do not  this is our only giveaway for this week  You dont have to take it  though  Most  if not all people who dont want the giveaway just say no when offered it or donate it to the bread basket box we have in our store  She started walking away from me  so I thought the conversation was done by this point  But she turns around  OL  Well  I think you should offer me another option  especially if the customer doesnt like the one the store has  Me  I understand  but unfortunately  this is the giveaway that was chosen for this week  There is no other free option  She was pretty annoyed at this point  OL  Thats ridiculous  Whats the value of the giveaway  then Me  The value of the giveaway is  dollars  but it is given for free when spending over x dollars  OL  Well  take  dollars off of my bill then  This doesnt even make sense  since the product we giveaway is   free  Its nothing like a coupon  I was super confused now  Me  Unfortunately  I cannot do that  That giveaway is the only option the store offers this week  OL  This store needs to offer another giveaway  It was getting busy again  and I was getting pretty tired of repeating the same thing over and over again  Me  Well  you can take the free giveaway  Or  your other option is to not take it all  She didnt say anything after that and walked away from me  so luckily for me that was the end of that,2529,459

196,oiicx7,1,0,Quarter Lady This is one of my favourite retail ‘horror stories’ to tell  I work at a drugstore  and in the couple days before Christmas we used to be open until midnight instead of PM   now we close early on Christmas Eve  lol So it’s Christmas Eve  about   PM  I make the announcement over the loudspeaker that we’re closing in  minutes  please proceed to the checkout  etc etc  This lady wanders over and asks if I can help her in electronics  which is just next to the main checkout  I help her  recommend a nice pair of headphones for her kid  and she comes up to my till at about   with a full cart  All in all her total is around    And her credit card declines  At this point the supervisor has come over to pull the security gate  The lady says “oh I have cash in my car  can I run and grab it ”We say okay  because Good Customer Service™️ and all that  So she comes back with a purse and starts pulling out   bills  And I’m thinking to myself okay  that’s manageable  Then she pulls out rolls of quarters  She paid   in quarters  We were stuck in the cash office counting quarters for  minutes,1138,212
197,oidyat,1,45,Customer is mad about price… Hello all  first time poster here  So I started working for a retail supply store in the recent months  I use to be a server and switched to retail and it’s been pretty good but today is the first day I’ve had a bad customer interaction So a lady comes in and is looking for some hair rollers  I show her what we have in stock and go about my day  She found some that she wanted and she asked what the price was  I told her what the tag said  since she said she could not see very well  I told her  based on the tag price  that it was only a few dollars  We immediately go to the register and the rollers ring up about   more  The rollers were placed in the incorrect location  I immediately tell her the price difference and she gets super upset  I tell I am sorry but they were placed in the wrong location  She tells me that since I told her they were a cheaper price  that I had to honor that price  I tell her I have to call my manager because I cannot change an items price without my managers approval  This lady is very insistent that I have to honor the price I told her  even though I told her they were placed in the wrong location  So she gets more upset when I can’t get my manager on the phone  The lady then demands my name and my managers name  I give it and I also call my manager again  My manager answers and I explain what happened in all of the five minutes I interacted with this lady  My manager says we cannot override the price because it was such a big difference and the only thing we can do is give the lady our customer service number  I say okay and inform the lady of what my manager has said  The lady decides to not buy anything and tells me she will “take care of this tomorrow”  I tell her okay and have a good day  I guess she thinks that I said something else under my breath and gets aggressive and basically says I will be lucky to keep my job after this  I just keep telling her to have a nice day and she eventually leaves  I guess I just don’t understand  being new to retail  why she got so aggressive  Anyway  I guess not the worse interaction but I definitely felt bad afterwards  TL DR Lady is rude over price difference and thinks she is going to get me fired,2248,441
198,oiamnj,1,22,I go the extra mile for a challenging customer and barely get a thank you I was just getting done a huge rush of paint orders and getting ready to grab a  gallon bucket for a nice couple when this woman walks up to the desk  blocking my way out  holding four tubes of subfloor adhesive  She’s got That Look on her face  y’all know the one  “I need a case of these  but you only have these four  do you have a case anywhere ” “If they’re not in that aisle I think we also keep them in lumber ” I answer  trying to finish this couple’s order  They’ve been here since before the rush was over and were very polite and patient  “Well  can you call and ask ” The customer asks  “I have to pick up some plywood and I really don’t want to walk back over here  I stumble over a reply trying to say I know for a fact they’re over there  then give up and dial lumber  I’ve seen it over there before  but considering the shortages of products I couldn’t guarantee it would be there  Naturally  they don’t pick up  Getting annoyed  I decide screw it  I’ll go look myself  I ask my coworker to finish the order I’m working on and let the customer know I’m going to check myself  She’s still blocking the opening to the desk  so I have to step around her to get out  I first check our aisle  which surprise surprise  nothing in top stock  and then walk all the way down to lumber  which is across the store from paint  my department  Thankfully we have some  nearly a full case  so I pick them up and walk them over to her  she was following about  feet behind   I set them in her cart  and the says  “you found those pretty quick  you don’t have one that’s not opened  I don’t want these rolling around in my car” “No  sorry ” I say  “This is all we have ” “And it’s not even a full case ” she gripes  “but I have these four so I guess it’s okay ” She thanks me halfheartedly and walks away  This woman took me away from my job  made me walk across the store to find a product from her  I carried a full case of construction adhesive to her cart  which is kind of heavy  and it still wasn’t good enough  And the “thank you” I got was out of necessity  not because she was particularly grateful for what I did  Lower your standards  lady,2245,431

205,oi06ma,1,12,Due to Technical Difficulties  Guy Threatens to Rob the Place I work in a retail chain that is prevalent in a lot of small towns   The equipment tends to malfunction a lot  but we always find ways around these problems to keep the cash flow coming and the customers happy Well  July rd  our store suffered a brownout   The lights dimmed and brightened for about five minutes  and then a particularly strong dimming made alarms go off in the store as well as shut down the registers   After everything came back online  it was realized that the card machines no longer worked   The stores connection to the net was down  as were the phone lines   We tried to restart everything  but nothing worked and tech support was useless   So we had to do something we knew would hurt us that day We had to accept cash only Bear in mind  we were insanely busy with people buying supplies for their cookouts and such   We made a point to inform EVERY  SINGLE  PERSON  who came through the doors that we were accepting cash only   Most people either said okay  or turned around and left   But one customer   he decided that this was an absolute affront to him personally   He stood at the entrance of the store  pacing back and forth  and literally growling   My line was very long  and I was working as fast as I could to check people out   All the while  this man is still making angry sounds and muttering to himself At one point  he approaches me and snarls  Im not kidding  he really snarled   Why are you only taking cash    Me    We had a brownout  and our card systems are down right now  Him    getting  or at least trying to  in my face   Then you need to lock the       damn doors    He stomped outside   I was hoping this was the end of it  so I apologized to the person I was checking out  who looked stumped to say the least   A few customers later  the man stomps back inside and yells for everyone to hear  What if I came back and robbed the place   This was a VERY bad move  as some of our sister stores had been robbed in recent weeks   I was stressed out beyond belief  and as someone who suffers from major depressive disorder and severe anxiety  I snapped back  No one is robbing this place while Im standing here    The man went scowled and dashed out of the store   My manager burst from the office  looking after him    Did he just say what I think he said   Me    Yep  She went after him  and made sure that he left the premises   There was only one other problem customer that whole day  but this guy was the worse of the two,2568,475
206,ohwawu,1,114,No sir  I am not hiding roasted chicken from you  We are just closed  So I find this event amusing after the debate I sparked in another thread about the hate relationship  food retail workers have with those  last minute  shoppers  To clarify what I mean by  last minute   Im not talking people coming during open business hours  Im talking the people that walk up  as  youre closing and start demanding service  So for the last two days a post I made sparked debate on whether or not we should have the right to hate last minute shoppers  And tonight I had  customers that reminded me why we  do  have that right  Long day  had  call outs and a no call no show  So already its a bad day  As the manager  I agreed to work the max amount of legally allowed hours in one shift   hours  to cover the call out and take the stress off my closing crew  However it meant that I had to have us done and ready to go at closing time so that I didnt leave them alone when I had to leave  And we were on point Cue literally two minutes before lights off  Lady walks up to the sub bar  Starts demanding a snadwhich  Fine  Were technically still open  She claims its an  easy order  and then proceeds to order FIVE SUBS  Alright  we will deal  Me and my crew knock them out in five minutes and get the bar recleaned in another five  Meanwhile I run out to break down the hot bar  rotisserie chickens  baked  pieces  and fried  and get it done  scanned out and out in the trash  So far were good  last minute sub lady only put us off by  minutes As I come back from trashing the hot bar and am starting to corral my employees out of the department  this nasty old man cuts us off with his cart and asks if we have anymore rotisserie chicken  I politely tell him  Im sorry but no  The department and bar close at pm  This guy huffs and puffs and walks away We make it to the time clock and Ive literally got a minute to spare before going over  hours  While im punching out I realize that grumpy old man has followed us because the time clock is right next to the customer service desk  He loudly announces  to make sure I hear  that he has a complaint  I literally rolled my eyes at him  Im off the clock  I no longer have to play nice  He proceeds to complain to the MOD that we had the audacity to break the bar down when it was supposed to be broken down  so his late ass couldnt buy chicken  He says that he does it  all the time  and he knows we just had it sitting back there and refused to serve it to him  Im trying to sneak out and the MOD stops me  Mind you  Ive been up and going for the last  hours and I am completely beat and just want to go home because I have the morning shift tomorrow which means at this point Im lucky if I get five hours of sleep before I have to do it all over again tomorrow  So first thing I say is  Sir  as i explained  we close at   That doesnt mean    it doesnt mean    it means pm  If you want hot product  you need to be here during business hours   Guys starts to act up and MOD bless his soul turns to the guy and goes  You heard her  They close at    Guy gets pissy and storms off to do the rest of his shopping  my MOD pays for my meal  and I finally get to go home on whats closing in at  hours  start to finish  day So yes   This  is why we dislike those last minute shoppers  We are over worked and underpaid and exhausted by the end of the day  Let us go home on damn time,3473,684

209,ohgrek,1,2,Is this a terrible thing to do to a retail employee  My mind is flashing back to the time that I was twenty years old and working retail  I was running the cash register and at that point had basically been told by my manager that of all the employees on staff  I did the best job at running the register because she could always count on the fact that my drawer would almost never be too terribly off and if it was  it wasnt ever too bad  One day my manager partnered me up on the register with a newer employee but first she pulled me aside and gave me strict instructions including that I wasnt to teach him ANYTHING about that register including the codes to open it  She made it out to be as if he were purely observing me only and she told me to discuss nothing with him about work and answer no questions if he started asking questions about the store  Me being autistic  literal and a strict rules follower followed her instructions to the max  I went on lunch break a few hours later and came back only for my manager to pull me and the girl who covered me for lunch off the register and into the back and lay into both of us because the drawer was off by    At this point the guy was long gone  After we both promised and swore up and down and left and right that both of us had followed her instructions to the letter and not taught that guy ANYTHING  my manager calmed down and figured out he mustve memorized the codes to the drawer just by watching us  Turns out that that particular employee had been having issues frequently where hed cover people or be on the register for breaks and when my manager would count his drawer would be off by quite a bit so she started to suspect him of theft  So apparently she decided to test her theory by partnering him up with me for a shift and seeing what happened since she could  always count on my drawer being most accurate  she figured out that if as her suspicions became correct MY drawer was off by quite a bit  then shed have her answer about whether he was stealing and thatd give her enough to let him go  Im just wondering if it was a crappy thing for her to basically use me as her own personal sting operation without telling me ahead of time  And the fact that not only did she not tell me  when my drawer was off she took me in the back and proceeded to yell at me first before hearing my side of the story   only then did she calm down and explain what happened,2441,472
210,ohdexn,1,76,How was I rude   I’m fuming right now because a customer called me “incredibly rude” and “needed to improve my work ethic”  So  And I think I said this on this thread before  but my store does not take mobile pay  And the last time a customer insisted on using mobile pay  I snapped at them   Note  our card readers are not set up to take nfc payments  and even if it was  our company will fine our store if we accept that form of payment  This time after I rung up the customers  I noticed one of them prepping their smart watch for mobile transaction  So I told them  “sorry  no mobile pay ” They take out their phone and I repeated myself  But they said this was different from mobile pay  I still told them we couldn’t accept that as a form of payment and he said “it’s a Samsung  it works like the magnetic strip of a card so it will work ” I still repeated myself “still we can’t take mobile pay”  I did look it up later and it’s not like “mobile pay” but either way we couldn’t take it  On a side note  I had no idea Samsung had that feature  I’m an apple user  He then gets mad and said “it’s not mobile pay  you are being incredibly rude  You need to better your work ethic”Finally after they pay  he request to speak to a manager  All the managers are gone for the day so I direct him to the person in charge  I didn’t bother getting close to them but I knew they were informing the person in charge about how “unprofessional” I was   Which I wasn’t  My coworker next to me heard the whole thing and after the customer left he told the person in charge they the got mad over nothing  it pisses me off when customers do not understand that WE DON’T TAKE MOBILE PAY,1693,322

213,oh3857,1,6,Do you have my dream shoes  This happened years ago  before online shopping had caught on  so we would often get customers who had unusually demanding requests It was a quiet shift in my big box store  and this customer is walking up and down the fancy shoes aisle  clearly looking for something specific  So my coworker and I approach her and ask if we can help her find anything and she says  “ok  this is going to sound weird  but I had a dream last night about this absolutely perfect pair of shoes  They were silver and they fit me so well do you guys have those shoes ” Ok  a challenge we don’t have any silver shoes  but it’s been a really boring shift so we don’t mind spending a bunch of time trying to help this woman find an alternative  We look at each other and then back at the customer and my coworker says  “um  none of our shoes are silver right now  but we have a few in gold…” and my coworker bends over to grab a pair and show the customer  This woman seems nice  albeit strange  so we’re genuinely trying to help her find an alternative to whatever she dreamt about  but she’s not giving us any actual information  so we’re just grabbing different shoes  and asking if the dream shoes had straps  a tall heel  were they sparkly  And she keeps telling us the shoes are wrong  but not giving any descriptions or details except that they need to be silver and that they were very  very pretty and perfect  She’s becoming less fun now  as she seems genuinely annoyed that we aren’t producing the “dream shoes”  So we start kind of hinting that we’ve now shown her every type of fancy shoe we have and she says  “You must have them you have everything ” And she starts going down the aisle  pulling out shoes from our surprisingly well organized shelves  that clearly aren’t silver  and asking us if we have them in silver in another aisle  She’s pointing at the shoe boxes of overstock  which are arranged in a particular order  not related at all to what’s displayed on the shelf underneath  and insisting we pull them down and show her that they aren’t silver heels   Because we secretly have the most amazing silver heels  we’ve just chosen to hide them in a deranged Willy Wonka style treasure hunt for our own amusement 🙄  We finally give up trying to help her  but we can’t go far  because she’s now trying on random pairs of shoes and getting visibly upset that they aren’t what she wants  She asks us for help again  insisting that we check the back  call another store  and show her what is in practically every box up top  After some more irritating back and forth  explaining to her that we truly do not have the shoes she’s looking for  as she’s continuing to try on more shoes  leaving a growing pile of them on the floor out of spite  we finally suggest to her that maybe one of the shoe stores in the mall has some silver heels  She sighs  and says the mall is too expensive  accepts that we don’t have the mystery shoes she dreamt about and leaves,2987,545

215,ogza9x,1,30,The Most Surreal Customer Ive Experienced I recently found out about this sub  and so I thought Id share one of my craziest stories I experienced in my opinion  This happened fairly recently  at least a month ago  For context I work for one of the big companies as a cashier  I also havent worked there for very long and am still fairly new  This occurred when I was on self checkout  It was fairly busy and I was by myself for a bit running around trying to help everyone  we usually have  people  I forgot why I was by myself   One lady caught my attention to let me know that the older woman next to her needed my help  Now  sometimes we get people who dont know how to use the self scan  and I have no qualms about helping teach them how to use it  Well  when I get over to her shes immediately freaking out and talking at mph  Shes saying things like   Im from City and I dont have time to learn this   and  Can you just do this for me   Immediately I know that this woman is going to be a handful and cause problems if I make the wrong move  so I just agree to help her scan her items  Luckily at this point a coworker had come over to help other people while I helped this lady Once I started to scan her things  shes very happy  She starts talking at me and Im half listening as Im doing all this for her  I catch a few things like how shes telling me that Im the greatest and how she loves me  Just showering me in praises and also talking about her life and family  Well that all didnt last too long when I hit a snag  The next thing I know I look up at the screen and its telling me to insert the coupon into the slot  This prevents me from scanning more items  I dont know how it happened  but I knew what to do  We have a piece of cardboard we use to push down coupons when the slot gets full to get past the sensor  I try to explain to the lady I need to get the cardboard because I cant scan anything else until I fix the issue  and that Ill be right back  Immediately  like flipping a switch  shes freaking out again   Youre leaving me    So what youre going to be gone for like  hours   Basically accusing me of abandoning her  I promise her that Ill be back in like  seconds and that seems to placate her  so I rush to get the cardboard and go back Once I was back she fell right back into how she was earlier  praising me and telling me about her life  Im once again half listening as Im working when she tells me she doesnt want to buy some bread she had in her cart  I let her know again Ill be right back to put the bread in the cart we use for unwanted items people leave there  Once again she freaks out that Im abandoning her  I quickly put the bread away and come back to her once again flipping the switch and being all friendly and nice again  This time I remember her talking to me about celebrities and how they all have diseases  She also mentions Bill Gates divorce and how she hopes I meet him and marry him   I finally finish up helping her and she thanks me and leaves  I was EXHAUSTED  Part of me was also feeling like I had just been played  like there was no way someone like that could actually exist in real life  Whether real or a joke Im just glad I havent seen her since,3262,637

222,ofmflb,1,1,Discrimination This is Covid related so Im not sure if itll be allowed  but I wanted to share this comment a customer made yesterday Back last year my province made wearing masks inside mandatory and my store  obviously  followed suit  We were told that no exemptions were allowed A guy came in  we told him about the no mask  no service rule and he was really smart about his response  telling us we were discriminating against him because of his illness  He used the proper buzzwords that made it impossible for us to argue our new rule   I spoke to my manager about it and it came down the pike that it wasnt up to us to explain or justify the rule  simply to enforce it  He stopped coming in  waited outside while someone shopped for him  Recently  the mandate ended and masks are now  Recommended   He came in yesterday and ignored me the entire time  from my greeting to finishing the transaction  At the very last moment  he said   Thanks for not discriminating against me   I just looked at him My dude  my guy   First  no one was discriminating against you for your so called illness that prevented you from masking up  I was simply enforcing a rule I was told to enforce   as a means of protecting myself and my coworkers  Secondly  the mandate is over  Even if I disagree with it or feel uncomfortable with people not being masked in the store  theres nothing I can do about it,1406,250

225,of3ba9,1,25,My first complaint  So I have worked at a small woman owned company for three years  We downsized because of COVID and only have three employees so we regularly work alone  Today during the peak hours there were about  woman shopping and me running around trying to appease everyone  One woman walked in and I missed her and didn’t greet her  Apparently this is a huge issue for her  As she is checking out she passively mentioned how we used to be friendlier which I just brushed off as there was a line behind her  At the end she asked for my associate number and someone to contact  I said “we don’t have associate numbers  there are three employees but I can give you my name and you can call the store tomorrow when the manager is working”  She said fine and left  I then texted my manager to except a complaint about me and why and she asked for the customers name so she could ignore the call  I am all about complaining when an associate is actually being a jerk but a missed greeting feels like a waste of everyone’s time and effort,1045,196

234,odhyqw,1,83,I calculated it myself so the register is wrong First post so I hope Im doing it right  English is not my native language  amp  xB So earlier this year I started working in a local grocery store so when this story happend i was still fairly new to everything and i wasnt wearing a headset at the time so if something were to happen id have to ask a colleague to call someone  Also we have extra screens that show the costumers the items that are scanned and their total and the registers are shared by two people facing away from eachother I already new the Lady this story is about  because the first time she was at my register she snatched the receipt out of my hand telling me to just put it down  So when I saw her in the line to my register again i knew i had to make everything perfect  She comes up and i start scanning her items  on a side note  she bought  cans of cat food haha and some other stuff  and i tell her the total  She looks at the screen  then looks at me and says that it cant be because she calculated it and the register is wrong  She then proceeds to recalculate the items in her head  probs to her i couldnt do this  and tells me the total she comes up with which is about € less  Im kinda lost since  you know  if the register tells me the price i cant change anything about it In comes the manager of the evening who backs me up  after checking if I did everything right  The Lady still says it cant be and recalculates at least three more time  Asking for the mamager not knowing she is already there  the asking for someone higher up  it was late the manager was the highest person in the store   Inbetween she tells us she is going to take the receipt with her and she wants to have it  Me and the manager tell her she can have the reiceipt but she has to pay first  She actually took so much time with complaining and recaculating and everything  that another costumer in line offerd to pay the diffrence  She finally decides to pay  once again snatching the receipt out of my hand and she leaves  That was already a wild ride for me because she was the first really rude costumer I had but you know it happens  I know that now  But the story doesnt end here  because the next time i work she comes up to my register from the oustide of the store  she wasnt shopping and came directly to me   I was scanning another costumers items and told her to wait and i was already looking for a way to get someone to help me if she gets rude again  since i wasnt wearing a headphone thing and i was alone in the register both   But I got a really pleasant surprise because she came up to alpologise to me  that infact she calculated wrong and the register was right and then she proceeds to tell me her life story  which i cut short  other costumers were waiting   And now everytime I work and she is in the store she comes to my register and is actually rather nice now,2916,559

242,oakybo,1,22,Glitch in the matrix      Another poster writing about what they couldnt control for the customer reminded me of this exchange  earlier this summer Working at a fine auto waystation with a Car Spa  car wash  its a little car wash  we get some people get confused as to how buying a wash is supposed to work         You can pay three ways You can drive right up to the machine kiosk and use your credit card  but  only  your credit card and it can be a little tricky Most people either like to pay inside by cash  or they pay at the pump while theyre getting gas        This is easier and then theyre given a code number on their receipt to enter at the kiosk  which will start their car wash The other day  an already inconvienced old man came to counter to say that his receipt didnt print out and therefore he didnt get his car wash that he had paid for        This happens commonly enough that I know well that I can just call up the pump transaction on the register and reprint his receipt with his car wash code on it        Naturally  the first thing I ask him is  what pump   is he at He replies  Nine     and repeats that number consistantly as we transaction tango        The reason for the song and dance was  I wasnt getting any readout from pump          Now  this can happen too  sometimes the network is slow  or sometimes its just a glitch in the matrix        Whatever  he was getting more and more upset that his car washing wants werent being instantly gratified    and that was MY fault of course         Regardless that I couldnt make the network connect any faster  he was going to send in a complaint and stormed off to his car in protest Now  it wasnt to busy so I looked out the window after him and noticed something strange  there was NO car at pump   and irate old man was headed to pump   Well then  I called up the screen to pump   and there was his car wash code        Printing it up  I even had a trainee run out there and give it to him  but he was still determined to be cranky Some people,2058,430

245,o9c5eu,1,15,Much ado about serial numbers When I was working at a thrift store  I got this one customer who was quite   odd   Well call her  Monica    She comes to the register to check out and I make some small talk and she puts her stuff on the counter   Monicas total comes to about   and she fishes out a five and asks if she could make a partial payment and come back later to pay the rest   I told her no  shes dressed like she could be homeless or something    She then takes out a tiny stack of ones and asks to borrow a pen and a piece of paper so I oblige I then notice that Monica is writing down the serial numbers to all the one dollar bills she was using to pay   This raised an immediate red flag so I ushered my Awesome Supervisor  AS  to the cash wrap   AS takes a closer look at Monica and asks her why she was writing down the serial numbers on a piece of paper   Monica replies that it would be  proof  that she didnt steal anything   Eventually  after writing down the serial numbers to the money  I take the cash as payment but only before I checked them for counterfeits per AS   I cashed out Monica and she went on her way  mumbling something about having to pay to get her clothes back or something AS then told me that she thought it might have been money laundering  I doubt it but it could happen   I then told AS that Monica writing down all those serial numbers wouldnt do anything because we would be giving that money away as change and her efforts would be worthless,1499,294

249,o93qc2,1,102,My one sided war with a customer over a bag To start  this is absolutely petty on my part  And I wont pretend it isnt I have a particular customer who comes in and gets  smaller items  Usually when its like this I dont default to asking if they need a bag  This customer stands there and waits until I ask them if I need a bag and they shrug and say   Sure   dismissively  Like they werent waiting for one and for me to ask I started recognizing the behavior from the customer and a couple of times if they came in  Id just go and grab the bag without asking and theyd say   Nah I dont need it   and leave  Even if they waited a minute  So I started getting annoyed about why they wouldnt ask for a bag  If I asked  theyd take it  If I didnt ask but grabbed the bag they wouldnt  But if I never asked or grabbed a bag  theyd wait  I was convinced they were messing with me So instead of being a normal person and just continuing to ask them for a bag  today I wanted to stretch the limit They came up to the counter when no one else was in the store and got a bottle of soda and a pack of gum and once they were rung up and paid  I waited  I washed the counter a bit  started stocking behind the counter and they just    waited  On their cellphone looking up occasionally  I started sorting stuff and cleaning up and they stayed there I broke after about  minutes and asked them if they needed a bag and they just shrugged and said   Sure  My white flag is out and Im just gonna keep asking them for a bag,1533,296
250,o8w2lh,1,0,Picking Up A Soaked Chair From A Hoarder  Where I use to work  my store delivered furniture  This was several years ago  We had a couple who bought a power reclining chair from us  and later the wife claimed there were sparks coming from the motor  So me and a coworker were tasked with picking up the chair from the customers place  and bringing it back to the store for the workers in the store to look it over  When we get there  it was a property in a trailer park  and their trailer was surrounded by garbage  Lots of old lawn equipment  long uncut grass  You get the picture  It gets worse  We enter the trailer  and what you see in hoarder documentaries are real  Stacks of news paper  garbage everywhere  The place had cats and dogs  smelled of urine and feces  Me and my coworker move over to the chair  It smelled a lot like urine  The man who sat in it was over weight  walked with a cane  so he had mobility issues  We move to disassemble the chair  and as I’m taking apart the back  I notice a stain on the floor that at first I thought was melted chocolate  But then I noticed there were fragments of toilet paper in it  I still hope it wasn’t what I thought it was  but it probably was  We get the chair into the vehicle  and as soon as we are in  my coworker happened to be carrying a little bottle of disinfected  We covered our hands  and used gloves to remove the chair from vehicle when we got back to the store  The people who looked over the chair sprayed that things multiple times with cleaners  They figured the guy who would sit in that chair was literally going to the bathroom in the chair  and the urine was soaking through the chair  and then dripping onto the motor  and that’s what was causing sparks  I don’t know what they told the customer  but we returned a week later to return the chair to the customer  This time  me and my coworker wore gloves  and still used disinfectant when we were done,1947,365

264,o7nomx,1,108,Regulars Tear Up Store Over A TV Remote I work at a convenience store type place  we have a small spot where customers can drink beer and there’s a TV there    of the people who hang out in there are generally regulars  folks who go in everyday for the last  or  hours were open  They are very obsessive with the TV  Well  Friday the remote got stolen  Friday night they come in and I tell them remotes gone  TVs not even on because I turned it off since the remote got snatched  Had to stand on a damn counter just to reach the buttons   Clearly they didn’t believe me because every one of them came up to me separately asking for the remote  It’s gone  It’s stolen  I can’t just magic up a new remote  Saturday they are upset because I’m “lying” and just “hiding the remote from them” because I don’t want the TV on  I only have it shut off at night when I’ve people coming in to watch tv but are t buying anything  So  they clearly did the logical thing to solve this problem  They started searching the store  They went into the kitchen  they went behind the counting for that room  where we keep single beers and some important stuff   They went into the dry storage area  They went into the fucking  managers office  and rummaged through her stuff to find the remote  They ignored me when I said they can’t be back there because “I’m hiding the remote from them”  Of course they were allowed to go into those places  They spent more time in the store than some of the employees so they get to do what they want  right  Plus the owner loves them  she wouldn’t mind them searching her office  I went into their drinking room and announced to ALL the customers that anyone who goes into employee areas will be asked to leave immediately  got a few arguments and then I added I will contact the police if an individual refuses to leave  That got them to stop  I don’t think they understood the remote was   gone   until yesterday when I had to scold a few of them for doing that on my coworkers shift a couple days later and  remind them they can not only get kicked out but banned if they keep doing that These were multiple full grown   y o adults,2171,406
265,o7mcze,1,1,The bomb scare and the windows   In the midd ’s I worked for a large retail company in the North East of the UK  this was the time when the IRA where in full operation I worked in head office  one of the stores there had a position on the end of the street with three sides to it and large glass display windows all round  about  feet up was a canopy that went right around the end of the building and out about  out from the building Both stores where joined by a tunnel under the road between them as the other store was on the opposite side of one of the streets  Both stores had a basement and  floors So this day we get a bomb threat that there is a bomb in one of the stores  so all customers are escorted out the stores followed by the staff Once outside I stood with my back to the wall away from the windows so if there was a bomb and it went off I was in a safe place  the rest of the staff where all over the place in front of the windows I asked my fellow staff members to stand in the area I was in and told them if there was a bomb then the windows could be blown out and glass would fly every where and injure any one in front of the windows  Which they did One of the sales men was a good friend and I called him over to me  he asked why I called him  and then explained the situation to him and he joined us I was a false alarm there was no bomb   months later we had the same thing again  another bomb scare but this time when you went outside the building there was no one next to the windows  they where standing in safe zones or had walked up the street away from the buildings It would seam that word had got around the stores about staying away from the windows  and yes another false alarm  this happened about  times in total When people heard that it was me saying the windows could blow outwards I had quite a few pats on my back for that information from staff members The store was Binns Limited in Sunderland,1972,386

267,o779tp,1,72,She made me buy the candy bar and I hate candy   This was back when I was working at my local grocery store  It was in a lower income part of town if that helps set the scene in any way Our store was having a bit of a promotional  Everytime someone bought something a   off coupon would print out with the receipt  It was one coupon per customer per order and they had to spend at least   before the coupon would even go through Well one day this older gentleman walks up to the cash register with his little handful of items  It all rings up to about     He then hands me the   off coupon  The following conversation went a bit like this M  oh sorry i cant use that right now  You have to have at least   worth of stuff before that can go through  Is there anything else you want G  no this is it  I dont want anything else  Just use the coupon M  i cant use it until you reach    We sell bags for    if you want some of those G  no i dont want any bags  I just want what i have and for you to use the coupon  Now i know i could have probably just charged him for the bags so the coupon would go through  but i hate charging people for things that they dont end up taking with them  Slightly feels like stealing  So i decided to try some other things  M  how about one of the candy bars  Itll be enough to push you over   G   huffs and grabs the closest candy bar and hands it to me M   scans the candy and coupon  He ends up being    over  Transaction proceeds as normal minus the grumpy attitude of the dude  G   after recieving change proceeds to chuck it into the back of the room  I dont like chocolate bars The guy rants about it to himself for a minute before my supervisor came over to ask what was wrong  He told her that i wouldnt use his coupon and that i forced him to buy candy and he doesnt even like it  She then turns to me and tells me i should have just charged him for bags,1938,376

269,o6r6gz,1,1,Lady  probably  broke out of mental hospital and tries to take me home This happened today  literally a few hours ago and Im still a bit shaky tbh So for a little bit of context  this lady apparently tried to buy a few items before my interaction with her  She went through self scan and apparently didnt have enough money to pay for her stuff  so she said she was going to go to the gas station to get money from their ATM  theres a bank literally right next door from us with an ATM   She came back an hour later and loaded up her carriage with more stuff  and then came to the front  She started scanning her new groceries and came up to me wondering where the items she didnt pay for last time were  I had no idea what she was talking about because I wasnt there an hour ago  She pointed to one of the self scans and said she left them  right there   and when I asked her when that was she said  about an hour ago   I thought it was strange that she would assume her groceries would stay at the same self scan for a WHOLE HOUR  but didnt think much else of it  I found her suspended order on another register and brought her the bag Me  Are these your items L     Im so confused Me     Are these not yours  You said it was Ritz Crisps and thats whats in the bag L     Theres items missing Me  There are  Well  whats missing L     Im so confused I look at the suspended order slip and sure enough  all the stuff on the slip are in the bag  I tell her this  and she repeats  I am so confused   and then says its fine  she doesnt want them anymore and goes back to scanning her groceries  Ok  whatever As shes scanning her groceries  my manager comes up to me asks if the  woman in the white nightgown  is still here  I didnt really notice what this woman was wearing  but once he asked me that I was like  huh  that lady was wearing something strange  wasnt she   I look at her  and yep  thats her Anyway  she pays for her stuff and starts to leave  L  Thank you so much  honey Me  Oh  youre welcome L  Now  are you gonna go home with me Me  Haha  no  I gotta stay here  I have a lot of work to do Lady     So youre not coming home with me Me  still thinking shes joking   Nah  they need me too much over here Lady  Im being serious  You dont need to stay here  you can come home with me  Lets go Me  Y You are  Um  its fine  really  I still have a long ways to go of my shift Lady  What time are you here until  Ill come pick you up Me     Im here all night Lady  All night Me  Yep   all  night She keeps asking me what time Im working until  and I keep responding with a jokingly cheerful  Im here all night   praying to GOD shed just leave  She makes a weirdly threatening comment along the lines of  Well I really hope you are here all night  then   Then she gets quiet and stares at me  An unblinking  see through your soul stare  Now Im really starting to get nervous  so I tell her to have a good night and walk away to do work  She continues to stare at me for  like  three minutes  and then goes up to a hand sanitizer pump and starts pumping hand sanitizer into her hand while staring at me unflinchingly  Two coworkers of mine saw our interaction and theyre keeping an eye on the woman  I start thinking  Im going to give her one more minute  and if she doesnt leave by then then Im going to call someone to remove her from the store   Thankfully she FINALLY leaves  I go up to the two coworkers who saw the interaction and they were like  Wtf  do you know her    apparently one of them thought I knew her because of how I handled it  lol  But yeah  because Im really bad at noticing what people wear  they inform me that she wasnt wearing a  nightgown  but a HOSPITAL GOWN  and apparently even a hospital bracelet I mean  I could be wrong  Maybe she got released  but I dont think they would release her wearing the hospital gown  And she definitely wasnt  um  well enough to be released  Anyway  that was definitely the scariest customer interaction I ever had  But I feel sorry for her  shes not ready to be out in public like that  Apparently a customer told the manager that they were going to call the police but I dont know if they did I told a few other employees the story and they were all like   was it the woman in the hospital gown   I have  no idea  how I didnt notice she was in a hospital gown  I hope she gets the help she needs,4453,822
270,o6n21z,1,106,Woman tries to have me arrested for stopping HER from shoplifting I  F  work at a large craft retail store and it was almost closing time  I was at a register waiting for stragglers to check out  and had my back towards the exit  which is right behind the registers  There was nobody coming up  so I was looking around  and I noticed a woman walking quickly behind me towards the exit  By the time I saw her she was already turning towards the doors and walking into the foyer which leads to the outside entrance  and I only saw her back and a little of her side  enough that I noticed her arms were crossed over her chest like she was holding something against it  I didnt much of it  just yelled  have a good night     I guess she was so focused on getting out of the store she didnt notice me standing there  so when I spoke to her she startled really badly and dropped what she was holding  It was a little vase that cost like  dollars  So immediately I walked towards her out into the foyer  I dont know why she stayed there  she could have just booked it and I wouldnt have followed her  and I asked her if she was planning to pay for the vase  kind of in a snarky way  but it was late and I was too tired for this bullcrap   She got huffy and said yes  so I picked up the vase to bring it to my register and check her out  I dont know if that set her off or what  but she suddenly got PISSED and snatched the vase away from me  She said  I PAID for this  and then started talking some bull about my dirty paws being all over her property  I already knew what this was gonna turn into  so I went to the registers and picked up a phone and paged for my manager  A couple of my coworkers came up to the registers and she started talking to them about how I had tried to steal her property and accused her of shoplifting  and yelled at her  They all knew she was lying already because Im a very quiet  shy person  and Ive never raised my voice let alone yelled at someone at work  The lady started telling my coworkers to call the cops  and also started saying that I had physically cornered her and that she was afraid for her life  Now this woman was tall and pretty broad  and Im average height thin  so shes a good   inches taller than me and much bigger besides height  Theres no way I could have intimidated her that much  My coworkers and I just let her carry on until my manager got there  and it turned out that he had been suspicious of her earlier and had been checking the cameras  When she tried to start her bullcrap on him about having me arrested and stuff  he already knew she didnt pay for anything and told her to leave and stop harassing his employees  She told him that she would be calling cooperate  he said go ahead  and she stormed out after that  The kicker of this whole thing was that she was wearing what seemed like expensive clothes and nice jewelry  and when we watched her leave it was in a car that looked pretty new expensive  And she was trying to steal and make a big fuss over a little  dollar vase  When she obviously has the money to afford many of them  I hate customers like this,3149,607
271,o6gzl7,1,2,Things like this just leave a bad taste in my mouth  I work for the company that employs electricians for small jobs  Part of  my job is to answer the phone  take their information  type a quick  summary of the job  and then open the work order for the electrician   which they will then use to contact the client and do the requested  work  Its summer  and the guy who does the billing is on vacation  which means I get to answer a second phone and write invoices for simple jobs  to ease his workload when he gets back I get to work  and phone starts ringing  A client introduces himself and wishes to talk about a invoice he received  about work that was done earlier this month  As he is giving me the information  I pull out the information about the invoice in question  The job our company did seemed pretty straightforward  air conditioning system  with a thermostat So I ask   What seems to be the problem  He starts  by telling me   The amount hours done by your electricians  does not match to the amount that being billed and there are some items on the invoice that were not used during the installation  This does happen sometimes  I ask that he lists all the items that were not used  and so that I can correct the bill  by double checking with our electrician  After listing all the items  I ask him  And what about the hours  He answers   I did most of the preparations myself  and your electrician only had to do the coupling of the thermostat and the motor that runs the air conditioner   He does give me his estimate  for how much he thinks he should be billed about the work done  The amount is nowhere near what our electrician reported after finishing the job This is getting more and more complicated  so I inform him that I will be contacting the electrician  who was at the scene  and our boss about these inaccuracies  and that I would be contacting him after getting all the information After few calls and and some digging through our filing cabinet  I finally have some context  Apparently The client had visited our location when the work order was written and he was given an estimate about all the costs  work and material costs included  which he had agreed to  As per an agreement  the invoice was sent to reflect that amount  Though what he failed to mention during his phone call with me  was that the electrician was not informed about his homemade wiring work  So our electrician had to double check  which after doing so  had to redo some of the wiring  The electrician also told me  that the client had basically been breathing down his neck the whole tiime  slowing his work After talking with my boss  I was told to remove the items he claimed were not used  which were nowhere to be seen in our shop  and our electrician was confident that they were actually used during the installation  The hours that were billed however  were another story Apparently the hours electrician had reported  after finishing the job  were already  adjusted  so that we were able to meet the estimate  which the client had agreed upon  I was told that I could reduce the hours on the invoice by one  but no more than that So I do some calculating  and redo the whole invoice  I can already tell that the phonecall is not going to go over well with the client I call him  explaining the amount amount he agreed to  when he made the work order  I was actually waiting for him to get angry  maybe even vent his frustration  but he sounded dejected   This is just speculation on my part now  but he sounded more sad than angry That phone call lasted for about  minutes  He tried to make his case about all the preparation he had done  and how that should count for something  I informed him that we were willing to go under the agreed amount by removing the few items from the invoice and reduce the hours by one  but that was it  We had his signature on the paperwork and even doing this much is more than we would usually be willing to do So he tells me how he heard that our company was fair  and how our services were recommended to him because of that  At the end he told me that he would never recommend our services to anyone  and how disappointed he was about all this  I didnt really know what to say to him after all that  so the phone call ended after I simply told him that the revised invoice would be mailed to him  in a week or so,4399,797

274,o5tti4,1,4,Never Satisfied Customer Heres a retail story  but also Im asking for advice Ive been working for this ice cream shop for about  years now  In the first year  one day  I was working drive thru  I was taking this ladys order  but she was being complicated  She asked for two strawberry smoothies with extra sugar  wtf   I dont know whatever  I repeated her order and she cut me off saying  I didnt say banana   Thing is I didnt say banana either  I repeated her order twice exactly what she was telling me  but she was telling me thats not what she ordered  I was over it so I just told her  okay Ill have your amount at the window   Shes at the window now I take her money hand out her smoothies and shes upset C Customer Me MeC   Wheres the whipped cream  Me   Sorry you didnt ask for whipped cream C   No  I come here all the time  your smoothies come with whipped cream and a cherry  whip cream is an add on  its not included for any of our smoothies  also I worked   hours a week  first time Ive encountered her Me   Whipped cream would be an extra charge C   Wheres your manager Me   Im the manager C   No I want to speak to someone else Well  luckily  the night manager came in for night shift  I was done with her so I asked him to talk to her  This is where I became very upset  which I dont know still till this day if I was wrong to feel so upset about it  Well he talked to her  he remade her items and he sent her out with coupons for free desserts  for the trouble   She didnt deserve any coupons  I gave her exactly what she order  The most we should have done for her was remaking the smoothies and adding whipped cream with no charge  just to get her out of there  But not free desserts   I expect coworkers to have each others backs when the customer is in the wrong  Not throw them under the bus This happened ish years ago  I left the company for a few months  When I came back I only worked   hours a week every other week or really month  Then at the beginning of this year I decided to add more hours   hrs  About a month ago I saw her again  I didnt recognizer her  but I recognized her order  She was at our front window this time so I saw my coworkers handing out her items  She sent her items back to be remade  She just looked at them  said there isnt enough of anything in them  She ended up asking for a manager  she talked to another manager on shift  My coworker remade her smoothie TWICE before she was happy with it  After she left I started talking about the incident I had with her  years ago  My coworker told me they have to make her order over every time she comes  I told my coworker that  that needs to stop  Its a waste of our time and our product Now to the end of the story Cut to last night  Once again I noticed her order on the screen  If she was going to complain  we werent going to remake anything  She either takes it as is or we give her her money back and she gets nothing  Well I was telling my coworkers this when I was watching a different coworker hand out her order  She ended up asking for a manager  a coworker who has worked for the company longer than me stepping up trying to help her  She didnt want to talk to him asked for someone else so he gave her the GM managers name  She left  we didnt have to remake anything  yay  I asked him what she wanted a manager for     He said she was accusing me of calling her dirty word     What word     The customers are outside while we are inside handing out orders through windows  So she cant hear anything that was said if it was said He said she came the night before as well and he had the same problems  He was going to notify the GM about her  So what advice would you give to handle this lady in the correct way  Is refusing service an extreme to this situation,3853,721

279,o4a7cf,1,51,you shouldn’t have put your head there my store has an automatic sliding door just like a grocery store  at close we power it off so it won’t open automatically but we can’t lock the door until all the customers leave because that’s illegal in my state  last night i go power off the door at close and go have the cashier that isn’t currently ringing up customers ring me up  we hear knocking on the door so i look over and a customer is making the praying sign with his hand and begging to come in  since it’s after close i legally don’t have to let him in so i tell the cashier i’m going to ignore him  this man then pries open the doors and walks in begging for me to let him shop  now if i wasn’t going to help you before  why would you breaking into the store after close make me want to help you more  i rush over to the man pointing to the door and say “sir you need to leave right now  we are closed and you just pried open the doors that were powered off” he starts backing up out the door still begging for me to “make a special exception for him” as if i know him and think he’s special  i see the man exit the store so i turn towards the edge of the door and slam it shut only to hear the man exclaim “you just slammed the door on my head ” i look at the man dumbfounded and his whole body is outside the door but he is leaned forward so that his head is squished between the door  my first though was to say “well you shouldn’t have put your head there” but i was too speechless at this customers stupidity  you would think that someone would keep their body out of the way of a door someone is closing  he then exclaimed “wow you’re not even sorry ” and pulled his head out and scurried off  i honestly don’t know what he was thinking,1749,349

284,o3bwa0,1,42,Some people are just never happy This was back at the very beginning of the pandemic  Social distancing and masks had been required for a few weeks to a month I think  My store had changed from multiple lines to only one line with social distancing  We didn’t have plexiglass yet and could only have  registers open  I was on first register and my coworker on the other  Both of us were trying to get through the line and go as fast as we could with transactions  But people kept coming in  so the line was still very long and slow  My coworker left the register for a few minutes to take care of some important thing that I don’t remember now  It was just us two and the managers  all of the managers were busy  By the time the customer got to my line  it looked like I was the only person working  So  like any normal human being would do  he yelled at me for being slow  He complained for  minutes about the line being too long and too slow  He kept saying he knew I was trying  but it was still unacceptable  Now  I’m not the slowest cashier  I’m pretty fast and get most people in and out if they’re willing  He was not willing The irony of him complaining about me wasting time with each customer at the register and holding the line up… while he was wasting time and holding the line up to complain about it  It still frustrates me  He took so long yelling at me and kept going even after multiple apologies and thanking him for his patience  that I started scanning his items while listening to him ramble  When he finally stopped ranting  I asked him if he had a rewards number  There were problems with his rewards number and it took a few minutes of back and forth with it  Basically he was missing information for his account Without going into too much detail  he mumbled a lot  so I needed him to repeat himself a couple of times  And he ended up saying the famous line “I’ve been coming here for  years and pay good money here ”  Which is weird because I had worked there for almost a year at that point in time and never saw him once  And if he truly had been a regular to any of our stores  there wouldn’t have been any missing information for his account  After finally fixing his rewards account so that he could get like   saved  he glared into my soul and said “See  You did something wrong ” And left  My coworker returned and I called the next person in line  The next person was so sweet  She said so many nice things  like that the previous guy was a jerk and that she wanted to let me know that I did a great job  That’s when I couldn’t hold back the tears in my eyes  I had my coworker cover for me and had a power cry in the break room for about  minutes  I got back to work and pretended nothing had ever happened I’m still working there and have never seen that guy return,2824,539
285,o377it,1,35,Customer threatens to call police on me because I cannot refund a phone minute card I have been a longtime lurker  and after six years of working in the same store  I have plenty of stories  So many  However  the one that I would like to start sharing with you is a simple one  although one that makes me want to punch many walls out of pure frustration I work in a small general store  Ive been at this particular store six years  I have been a key holding manager five  and I have been assistant manager for over a year  Needless to say  I have seen and experienced some shit  But  this  This isnt the craziest  but hooboy  its seared in my memory of one of the most annoying shifts I have ever worked Its our busiest day of the week  and I have been at the store since six am and I have just gotten off of break at  noon   I promise this is important  Remember this   As soon as I walk out  my cashier looks at me and goes   Hey  I have an issue with a return and Im not sure what to do   No problem  Shes developing a line  so I instruct the customer with the return to move to my register so I can help him while the cashier continues to check out the customers waiting in line  This is something that happens often  and Im chill with it  I would rather take care of it myself than have someone who isnt sure how to proceed deal with it  If we were slower  Id have them watch me to learn  but as its busy      Ill just take care of it and move on Its the Saturday before Memorial Day  and my plan was to start setting up displays of grilling supplies  cases of water  our Memorial Day flowers  etc  Things people would be looking for during the week to prep for the weekend  Alas  I had no idea I would be spending the next two and a half hours of my shift dealing with this customer He and his wife are both regulars  and they are the kind of customers that when they come in  you know theres going to be an issue  They believe they are entitled to anything they cook up in their little heads  and if they dont get their way  the threats come out  Theyre just     exhausting  They are also far too familiar with our return policy  A policy I say every time we sell something that could pose an issue  or is a special case  Like cellphones  Sir is here with a cellphone return  Ah  the headaches  Here they come He has bought a the issuing company cellphone for his  birthday   and it will not work  He explains that he had activated it  but it states there is no SIM card  Im like  alright  lets see if I can just fix the issue without having to process the return  Customer has a working phone  and everyone is happy  I go through his settings  and sure enough  I get a pop up  No SIM card detected  Open the phone  SIM card is there  Maybe inserted wrong  I take it out  make sure its right and put it back in  No SIM card detected  Okay  cool  I explain to him that I do not have another phone like this in stock right now  and he demands a refund  Coolio I start the return  which deactivates the phone   and he informs me that he also wants a return on the minutes he bought for that phone  I explain that I cannot process that return  and that it says so on the receipt  I show him  and this    is when it starts to get loud  There are about ten people in line currently  and seven of them are behind him when he raises his voice and says   If you wont give me my money back  Ill just call the police  Theyll get me my money back    Hindsight is    I shouldve just told him to call  Wouldve saved me some time  lmao   I start to talk to him  he just talks over me louder  demanding that I give him his money back  I try one more time with the most polite voice I can muster  and once again   I am calling the police right NOW   Sir  if you would calm down for one second and listen to me  you would understand that I am trying to help you solve this issue  Would you like me to call the issuing company to see if we can fix the phone so that there is no issue to be had  Sudden attitude change  Probably because I damn near had to yell it to be heard over his tomfoolery  He obliges me and I go outside to call the issuing company  We have to reactivate the phone  Fine  cool  Shoot a message to my Store Manager to let her know my till will be short  but the money doesnt exist since the return was never processed  I just needed to reactivate the phone through our system  Cool  We good  Try to reactivate his phone   One hour has passed  My relief has arrived as well as the night cashier by now  also important   Sir bothers me the entire time about how long its going to take  I inform him that he can either wait or take the phone and deal with the issuing company himself  He chooses to wait  Duh  Still no luck  I explain to him that theyre trying to reset the connection with the towers  Wait thirty minutes  turn the phone off  and try to make a call  He nods and leaves Freedom                  Not quite Thirty minutes later  Sir is back  He claims it still isnt working  Alright  did you turn it off and back on like I instructed you  No  Okay  we do that  Still doesnt work  I inform him there is nothing more I can do for him  that he needs to call the issuing company himself and get it sorted  Once again he starts to raise his voice  and I cut him off   Sir  I have been attempting to fix this issue for you for two hours now  it is time for me to go home  I  Cannot  Help  You  You need to contact the issuing company   He reluctantly shuffles away Only for his son to come back in the next day and tell me he needs a new SIM card  Something I would have suggested had the man given me time to speak  I sell him the SIM card for a dollar  and what dya know  It works  How amazing  Sir comes back in because he forgot all of his phone accessories  and I give him the bag  He thanks me for being a big help  and here is where    I maybe get a little facetious because I respond with   Of course  no problem  But  next time  I will not help you if you threaten to call the police on me ever again  He claims he only threatened that because  that boy  aka my night cashier got an attitude with him  I pause  stare at him for a moment before replying   Sir  when you threatened me with that  he wasnt even here  His shift did not start until   and he was not in the building until    Just have a good day  alright   He didnt respond  and I went back to work  Which I know sounds very   whatever but its an approximation of what I said  Remember  I came off of my break at   and I remember being outside on the phone with the issuing company when my night cashier walked through the doors  The only thing he said to Sir was to ask him to please stop making a scene inside the store because I was outside actively trying to get his phone to work   I have no cell service inside my work building  therefore I had to be outside to take care of everything so that my store phone would remain open for customer calls  And  Im still just so confused as to how he thought the cops were going to get his money back when the receipt clearly stated  NOT VALID FOR RETURNS  REFUNDS  TRANSFERS  AND HAS NO CASH VALUE underneath the PIN number I swear I love my job  Maybe Ill be back with some of the other craziness Ive experienced  Like the crazy clothes thief  the battery thieves dumb enough to tell me they were banned from another store  or perhaps the two people who tried to get me fired  Oh  Theres also the drunk naked lady that accused me of hitting on her boyfriend  While I was stocking charcoal  Fun times  gt  Editted to remove some identifying info I forgot to censor   amp  xB,7694,1463
286,o32dem,1,38,The fitting rooms are closed for a reason  So  I work in a big brand clothing chain  but a smaller store  Today  I was asked to tidy around an area of my shop  and this area is known for being the messiest and having dumped stock all over it because its home to the best mirror  As I started tidying everything away  my manager came over to me and started to tell me that shed just spotted two women who used to go into her old shop all the time and swap the tags from cheaper garments onto more expensive ones so that theyd get what they wanted for significantly cheaper  She pointed them out and asked me to keep an eye  which was easy because they were at the mirror every  seconds  I carried on tidying the area when another woman  lets call her Pam  came over to the mirror and started trying clothes up against herself  Now  its important to note  we have intermittently had our fitting rooms open  provided the shop is not busy and there are ample staff to keep on top of sanitising each room after theyve been used  as well as disinfecting garments of clothing after theyve been tried on When its busy  they are closed  and all staff are on the shop floor in order to help customers as best as we can  keep the shop tidy  and put the returns and dumped clothing back in the right places  We allow people to try on jackets  shoes  button ups  etc and just ask they are left behind the till if theyre not wanted so we can disinfect them  Sometimes  people will try bits and bobs on without our permission and it isnt the end of the world  we just tidy around after them and complain about it to one another  Today we had the fitting rooms closed  however  something must have been in the air  Pam started putting the clothes on  Okay  fair enough  its over her own clothes  Ill leave her be  I carried on tidying  looked up to check on the robbers and Pam was now in her bra  slipping a dress over her head  A couple of times now we have had customers sneak into our fitting rooms  but our in the open like this Even pre Covid  when was it ever okay to just get half in the nud in the middle of a shop   I went immediately over to my manager and told her what happened  she brushed it off  saying something along the lines of  well if she wants to be half naked in the middle of the shop  let her   There wasnt exactly a lot more we could do about it after that realistically  One of the girls on the till  lets call her Vicky  came over to see the faces of the people who were known for robbing  just so that she could make sure to double check their items if she was to serve them  I told her about the woman getting undressed  and as soon as she started walking back to the till  ANOTHER woman took her top off in the middle of the shop so I shouted her back over to see  The robbers were now both trying clothes on too  and Pam started to put some other clothes on  I didnt know what to do  the state all of these women were leaving the shop in was horrendous and I just wanted them gone Another girl I work with  lets call her Stella  came over to tell me that the manager now wanted the women told not to play dress up in the middle of the shop  I think the manager realised how out of hand it was beginning to get  We were umming and ahing until Pam took her top off again and Id had enough  I went over and said pretty much exactly  Im sorry that our fitting rooms are closed  but you shouldnt be trying clothes on in the middle of the shop floor  not only because of the pandemic but its also extremely inappropriate to be in your underwear in the middle of the shop floor  I obviously didnt say it kindly  but I wasnt angry  I told her  and the two robbers who were also trying clothes on  sternly  I know I couldnt have even raised my voice because the robbers were asking me what I said as they couldnt even hear me  Pam  though  said I was shouting at her and intentionally embarrassing her in front of the whole shop and I was angry and horrible  she wouldnt stop  Stella was telling her that I wasnt shouting but she wouldnt listen  Stella was actually very calmly saying  I understand how you feel and I understand what youre saying  but I was right here and OP wasnt shouting at you   but Pam wouldnt listen  I said  can I talk   and Pam replied  WELL I HAVENT FINISHED TALKING YET  and proceeded to repeat everything she had just said  Stella pulled me away and we left them to it When theyd all finally left the mirror  I started cleaning the state that theyd left the shop in  it was awful  I hated touching the clothes that theyd worn  I wish Id have got the disinfectant from the fitting room but I wasnt thinking straight  I just wanted it tidy  Vicky came over again and told me that Pam was just screaming at Stella  telling her that she shouldnt have sided with me  She said that the two women behind her had to ask her what was the matter and said that we were being horrible to her  Stella simply informed Pam that those two women were thieves  so it shows how strong their judge of character must be This is the first serious altercation Ive had with a customer after having worked in this store for nearly a year  not excluding lockdowns to be fair   Im not a confrontational person and I tend to give my customers the benefit of the doubt  But to expose yourself in the middle of a shop  Thats seriously inappropriate  And to put clothes on without any safety measures in place  As silly as that sentence sounds  it just upsets me,5527,1040

basically sold phones and activated service for people Around this time  we had been unbelievably slow  Like  for the past four weeks at that store wed only see maybe  person a day  if at all  Incredibly boring  and I was getting paid to basically stand around on my phone all day because without customers there was nothing to really do at our location  Thered be a lot of times where Id completely zone out  and forget I was at work  and Id feel like a zombie when customers would come in  Like I was on auto pilot  if that makes any sense  Was hard to snap out of Well  one day  I was in this mode  I was working with a coworker who did not like me  and would go out of his way to avoid interacting with me  So I was inside  behind the counter by myself  playing on my phone  while said coworker was outside talking on the phone to his wife mom dad friends whoever  out of sight  However  at this time  I thought he was in the employee back area A lady walked in at this time  very energetic and bubbly  with her teenaged son    and a dog carrier with a puppy inside  She seemed nice  but something felt off about her and I had a bad feeling  She explained that she had an appointment with us  and I was unaware that wed had any so my response was   Oh  I didnt realize we had any today  Which it doesnt really matter if thered been any kind of appointment  she was there so she was going to be helped regardless  My statement seemed to throw her off  but I explained it wasnt a problem  I grabbed a nearby tablet to start opening up her account  and she started explaining to me that she was just going to leave the dog off to the side of her  as itd just been at the vet for a surgery  I wasnt sure we were allowed to let people bring animals  but the dog wasnt hurting anyone so I didnt care Its important to note  that our tablets work terribly  It is one of the main reasons I quit  because they decided to get rid of our computer systems and make our entire work process on the tablet  They are slow and glitchy  and the turn over rate in our district went from being balanced to insanely high because of this decision  They failed to troubleshoot the system all the way before releasing it as well so there were a lot of problems For some reason  my tablet wouldnt open  so Im standing there trying to figure out why it wouldnt bring the lock screen up  The lady looks at me and goes   Well  are you ready for our number yet  Its  Me    Sorry  one second please Maam  I put that tablet down  and grab the other tablet we had out that was ready  frustrated that the other one wasnt working suddenly  I start to open our system up  when she interrupts me Her   Wait  this is the store on  street name  right  Me   trying to make small talk  Yes maam  Theres another one across the street as well though  Why  Her   Do you think you could call them and see if they had any appointments for  Her name   Me   Sure  give me a second to look up their phone number  The store across the street from us  their number was harder to find because you had to use different keywords  It was a stupid layout  because people would confuse them all the time  If you just typed in   store name   city name   it would bring up our store number After a few minutes  I find their number  and start dialing it on our store phone  As soon as the phone starts ringing  the lady interrupts me again Her   Actually  since it seems like you dont want to work with anyone  I think I will go across the street  This is kind of when I broke character  because at this point I was already over the job itself and was very frustrated  Not even with her  but her attitude and tone at the time absolutely infuriated me  Im not saying I was in the right either  but the way it seemed to come out of nowhere also threw for a loop  Like  was I not just assisting you  Was I not about to call for you  or blatantly refusing service  Wtf  I tried to be polite  and not catch an attitude  but it was hard to hide the frustration in my voice Me   Whered that come from      Maam  I really dont care  its entirely your decision if youd like to go across the street  Her   in complete shock   Whatd you just say  Me   That I dont care  it is your decision whether you would like to leave or not  Im glad to help you either way  Her   Well  I think I will leave  Ill have you know Ill also be reporting you    finger wag Me   Go ahead  its my last week anyway  Her   is anyone else here  Id like to speak to someone  Me   Um  yeah  let me go get them from the back  So I go into the back to get my coworker  but he isnt anywhere to be found  I hear her trying to open the door thank god for locks   Next thing I know  the customer is banging on the door with her fist  Like  violently  Totally freaked me out  and I was lost on what to do because I wasnt sure where my coworker was  So I just sat down  and watched the cameras  Maybe I was an asshole  but going back to talk to her didnt seem like a good idea  This was all in front of her son as well  so that mustve been embarrassing My coworker finally walked back inside  because it was the end of his shift  and he was about to clock out  I have no idea what was said between the two of them  but he was able to calm her down a little bit  Though she still seemed pretty pissed  because I could see her wagging her finger in his face  talking to him  He was super agitated as she was leaving  so it must have not been fun for him to deal with  He let me know that she did  in fact  have an appointment and then left,5814,1085
290,o2anfd,1,58,oh look it is two today hey all got  smaller stories that happened today  the st one i heard offhand from my manager at work today and the nd is well you will see    the first thing was that a bartender that works for the bar behind my store came out and yelled at a truck delivery driver for  making my customers walk around the front of your truck   which is illegal  atleast so i am told  cause it was impeding the drivers delivery since she was telling him to move the truck or turn it around  All of this infront of my manager who was supervising the delivery      the nd was a pair of overset women came into the store   looked in her s while the others was around  or so  So the women come up to me asking about the chlorine tablets we have and I show them  the younger one pulls out her phone and asks me  so why can I not buy this online with my app   I explained to her several times  very nicely might I add  that we do not sell the tablets online cause of the shortage in stores  this lady basically complains about this for half an hour until my manager got off her break and came back into the store and decided to take over  and the lady spent another half hour complaining about the same thing and my manager told her the same thing i did  When the two ladies did leave the younger one said  i am never coming here again  that lady was an ass  which my manager is the nicest person you would meet in retail,1441,289
291,o1lxly,1,17,Confused patron I was reading through some posts and it reminded me of a situation that occurred back in It was getting late and we close at am  I no longer work at this chain  An older gentlemen was loading up a wagon for about an hour and a half  I was the sole register open   employees total in the store our manager and assistant manager and a Cart pusher doing stocking duty for the evening It was just before closing my manager noticed the man still did not seem ready but we closed the store anyway with him still shopping and the  of us focused on assisting him He was kind soft spoken yet very confused When he finally made it to the register we rang him up and he promptly paid  I cant remember if my Manager considered contacting the authorities but sometging did not seem right about the man After we finished our closing and locked the store we came outside to see him still standing there with his cart My manager spoke to him again he seemed disoriented but I couldnt gather what the exact conversation they were having was We ended up verifying his address on his drivers liscense and I drove him there he had walked to the store he did not have any transportation  There were no cars other than ours in the parking lot either I drove him home I remember distinctly he asked me to leave his groceries near his door but did not want help taking them in None of this was very inconvenient I lived  minutes away he lived the same distance from the store  But I never saw him again and always felt uncomfortable about the situation,1579,284
292,o1iuqq,1,5,I know what you want but    Hello fellow redditors  thought id share this little nugget from work    So I am a retail worker in a pool store and this woman walks in  I great her as per customs with the store and she asks  hey do you have any pumps that can suck out like propane or something    also gonna mention she was gesturing her arms in the motions of a pump   um  I know what you are asking for but  we dont have pumps like that in out store  you might want to go down to  insert store name  since they might have that type of pump  and I point in the direction of the store  She thanked me and walked out  I am still confused and walked back and told my manager about this  we had a nice laugh about it  My question is though  why ask for that type of pump in a pool chemical  supply store  All our items are pool related so we have nothing to siphon gas,870,173
293,o1ht5u,1,250,I’ll go into labour after I check out these sales In college I worked at a large chain store that happened to be going out of business so there were massive closing sales  During the evening while I was sorting some clothes in the Women’s Department  a very pregnant woman and her mother walked past me and all I hear is “oh my gosh  I think my water just broke ” Naturally  I whipped my head around to face the women since that’s not a line you hear everyday and sure enough  the woman’s pants were wet and a pool of clear yellow liquid had formed at her feet My first response was “oh wow” because my mouth reacted before my brain and just the amazement at the whole situation  I asked if they needed an ambulance to be transported to the hospital or if they wanted to take their own vehicle or call someone  And to my shock   the mother said that they were going to shop around in the store a bit longer because “these sales are too good to pass up” and the daughter whose water just broke and is leaking onto the floor  agreed    So they kept shopping and looking around  and tracking amniotic fluid everywhere they went and finally made their way to the cash to check out Meanwhile  my coworkers and I are scrambling to find the Wet Floor sign but it is MIA so I had to stand near the area where the woman’s water initially broke and direct customers to walk around it the fluid So they check out and leave to go to the hospital and at this point the woman was definitely going into labour and was waddling  more than a pregnant woman usually would  to get out of the store  As soon as they left  we broke out the cleaning supplies and started sanitizing I’d like to point out that when my coworker checked them out  she said that they weren’t even buying anything baby related  but all women’s clothing  I’m not judging because she could very well have had all her clothes and everything ready for her baby  But is a store closing sale really that important that you’ll keep shopping even after your water broke Never saw them again but hope the baby was born healthy,2084,384

303,nzd70y,1,53,Marriage on sale for    To this day Im still at a loss on how to process this specific interaction I had as a manager working for this particularly popular fabric store in my town  A woman had come in during one of my weekend shifts and I was asked by one of my coworkers to help her because she was being difficult  I happily complied believing that the woman in question simply did not know what she wanted   we get a lot of customers that dont know what they want for their projects  which is no big deal  I greet her and she tells me shes looking for cushions for pillows  She first tells me Im handsome  Im a guy  then I start showing her the cushions we had in stock Immediately she starts telling me that these will not do  that they are not right for the sofas she is trying to make before her sisters fly in  She further proclaims that I am incompetent and dont know what I am doing as well as threatening to report me to my reporting manager above me  This continued for what seemed an eternity and I gritted my teeth because Im too nice and patient  When she finally decided on something that she was okay with  the interaction shifted to me as a person  She asks if Im single  Uncomfortable with this complete  of a conversation I reluctantly reply  no   She then describes how she as a woman does intimacy acts the best and that as a man I need to experience it  Furthermore she asks if Ive been in an ARRANGED MARRIAGE Weirded out completely  I again reply  no    Marry me then   She replied  Quickly and awkwardly I said  no thank you   She did not like this answer at all  She went on a rant with threats about how the employees need to help the customer and that basically the customer is important  The verbal abuse continued to drain me along with the sheer disbelief  She ended her rant with yet again a threat to tell the general manager about how I was terrible and not only unwilling to help a customer but also terrible at my job entirely She gave me her cushions and told me to put them on hold for her until she came back  then left  I Quickly complied and walked away to make the hold  So I guess the moral of the story is  youre a terrible worker if you cant marry the customer  Lol,2240,419

306,nyoub7,1,24,Short Tempered Customers Steal Two Loaves of Bread and Berate My Customer Service While Doing So  I’ve worked at my grocery store for almost  years at this point and found nothing that felt crazy enough or important enough to share here  until tonight Today was a mostly average day at work  wake up tired and have a slow first couple hours on till  then get energized after a nice caffeinated beverage on my first break  The rest of my shift goes very smoothly with lots of compliments from my customers  Many of them were very happy to see me back on till as for the past few weeks I needed to do other jobs to let my hands recover  All in all a pretty typical and enjoyable day… Until the last hour or so of my shift After my last break we really started slowing down and with so many cashiers on till most of our time was spent finding little tasks to occupy our time  I ended up asking my manager if there was anything else I could help with  and she had me put our reduced to clear items in separate boxes to donate to the food bank  I ended up getting that done with half an hour left on my shift  So I was asked to clean my till and got that done when I was called to help a customer in the bakery Normally when cashiers are called to help in the bakery it is to write on cakes  get items out of the display case  or take orders for cakes  but today when I got there the customer had a different request  He asked for some of the bread that was left out unpackaged the temporary storage trays  I don’t work in the bakery normally so this might be wrong   Most of our employees would likely say that they don’t know their way around the bakery and thus can’t help  but not I  I told the man I don’t know why it was left there but I can see if I can get them for him if he really wants it  He said he did so I was off I quickly went searching for the bread packaging and found a box with the correct label and so I told him I’d quickly wash my hands and grab him one  By the time I got back with the loaf two other customers  a young looking boy and a slightly older looking woman  siblings maybe   were lined up behind him and asked me for two  I asked them for a moment and sealed the bread for the first customer and went to find the price  I checked all the displays that normally would have the bread on them and I couldn’t quite find the price  I was about to give my manager a quick call to ask her if she knew  when the boy asked me if I could get them their bread first  I was a little caught off guard by this given I needed to find the price to be able to sell the bread and I told them this  In response the woman said they can do it in the front  I know that they can’t so I say that the only way to do that is if they find the price here so I might as well find it first  She then tells me she worked there a few years ago and that she definitely could and she says some bs price at     I know that definitely isn’t the price so I quickly say it’s closer to     in hindsight I think it was    but it’s not too big of a deal   So I tell the man and wish him well and he is off  Now I tell the other customers that I don’t know why the bread has been left out they ask if it’s stale  This is a bread that has a hard outer layer and when I was holding the other customer’s bread it felt about normal so I told them that  They say that’s fine and that they want it so I get them their bread  I’m about to seal it in the bags when they tell me they don’t need me to do that  Once again I’m surprised but sure if they are happy with their bread unsealed then I will happily leave them to it and they are off A couple other customers are asking for a cake order  unfortunately as cashiers we have been asked to not take them unless we have been specifically trained by the bakery  So I tell them that and I will find someone else to take it for them so they can do their order  I quickly run to the front and ask the person taking over the service desk and self check if she has been trained she says she has and hands over the self check key to me  Low and behold the two customers from earlier arrive at the self checkout with their bread and a few other groceries  They need me to give them an override because there is too much weight on the scale  So I do my normal thing and ask them what the last item scanned was  it happened to be correct  I double checked their scanned item and all of them were on the scale  Then once again I’m caught off guard when the woman asks me if I’m new here  as if taking these steps are somehow a sign of inexperience   I reply by telling her I’ve been here for almost  years then do the override and tell them they are all good  I then await them calling me over again to help them with their bread as there is no way to enter it on the self check system without employee assistance  I quickly help some other customers with overrides and laugh with them about how finicky our self check is  Then I notice the initial two customers are paying and I am instantly confused and intrigued by how they managed to finish ringing through their items without my assistance As the customers walk away from their check out I ask them how they did their bread and they show me their receipt and point at an entry labels sandwich rolls  for     The woman then tells me that the bread was    per loaf  At this point I’m assuming they are very confused and I inform the that they entered sandwich rolls and not the bread they had  She tells me that the image looked exactly like the bread and so I go over to the self check and ask her to show me what she did  I notice they also left their cake in their basket which is kinda silly but I figure I’ll deal with it later  So I start opening the item menu to have her show me what she did  when the boy is pressing on the bread and all of a sudden decides it is stale  He says it’s rock hard and I apologize because I don’t work in the bakery I don’t know how exactly the bread is supposed to feel  She then says is this what you call customer service  Immediately I feel adrenaline coursing through me as I take great pride in my customer service and work as hard as I can to make sure all of my customers have the best experience possible  So I ask because I’m genuinely confused what did I do wrong  The woman then exclaims “unbelievable”  The boy asks her to leave it  I tell her I’m confused and I don’t understand what happened  She then tells says she doesn’t want to speak to me and she wants to return the bread and buy sourdough instead  I tell her I can help her with that  and she gets more frustrated and tells me she will go to the service desk because she doesn’t want to speak to me  I tell her that at this time I am at the service desk  And she says well I want to speak to anyone other than you  I tell her we don’t have anyone else available at the moment as my manager was on break and everyone else who could be at the service desk was busy  She tells me she’ll have one of the cashiers do it  While the cashiers are on till they aren’t supposed to do returns  it’s only supposed to be managers or the person working at the desk  I tell her this  And she even more angrily tells me that she doesn’t care who does it as long as it isn’t me  So I take a moment  pause  and ask where things went wrong and if there is anything I can do to improve her experience with me  She yet again tells me she doesn’t want to speak to me  I ask again and tell her I’m the only one who can help her and I’d like to do that if she can just tell me what went wrong and how I can serve her better  She absolutely doesn’t care and is practically hiding behind her arms at this point trying to ignore me  Then our service clerk for the day comes by and says he can do the return  I tell him that while he is normally a cashier while he is service clerk he isn’t supposed to do that  he has only been here for a couple months   But he insists  and I am forced to allow him to do it as if I continue to protest that would actually be bad customer service and I cannot allow myself to do that especially when I’m already being accused of poor customer service I let him process the refund and ask him what issue she had with me  and she says she thought I was accusing her of stealing  Which I very much wasn’t and I wouldn’t have thought at all normally until she said that that was her issue  He also told me that he recharged them and it ended about being about    for the bread  And no they didn’t actually change it for sourdough like they said they would  I then glance over at the clock and see that I am a minute past the end of my shift and quickly punch out  Then I double check the till and print the last receipt  and it is not the return receipt it is something entirely different  which means they left without actually paying and they had stolen the two loaves of bread I then fill my manager in on the details of what happened and she confirms they were definitely stealing as getting increasingly irate and refusing to explain themselves is a very telltale sign of attempted theft  The idea is they will scare you off so you might end up letting them go  She was also very shocked to hear that they insulted my customer service as I am one of the best at that in the store And yes  I know this whole story is basically about   worth of bread being stolen and it’s pretty pointless to actually get worked up over something so small  But on principle I can’t let people leave without paying as that would be theft even if unintentional  And then I very much couldn’t let the situation simply stay after they attack my customer service  Once that happens I go into my serious mode where I take the interaction ridiculously seriously as I need to show them that their initial impression was wrong and I am in fact able to provide top quality customer service which is why I couldn’t simply let them go Anyway sorry about this massive story and thank you for reading to the end  If you have any questions or would like me to clarify anything I’ll happily do so for you if you ask in the comments  Thanks again,10149,2006
307,ny8jwf,1,26,If I buy a bunch  can you give me a better deal  So a story on this sub Reddit reminded me of this  Where I use to work  probably similar to a lot of retail locations  we’d have one item on the front page of our sales flyer which would be discounted heavily  Like  percent off or so  And it would a type of item where they would put in “While supplies last ” There was one item we had on the front page  and I was curious to see how much money our store were making per item  and since I have access to look up that info  I decided to take a look  We were making  cents per item  I had a women come in  and she was buying a whole bunch  I can’t remember how much  but she took a huge chunk of our inventory  She then proceeded to ask me “Since I’m buying a whole bunch  can I get them cheaper ”I looked at her and replied “No  Sorry  We are only making  cents for every one sold ” She gives a defeated “Oh ” I can’t remember what she did next  but I think she put them back where she got them  I don’t remember the sale price  But I think it was below  dollars,1080,220
308,ny7sor,1,29,I’ll just buy a new one Worked in a camera store sooooooo many life times ago when digital cameras had only just started coming out To go along with the then new tech  we started doing in store printing from digital media but only certain media like CDs or USB or Floppy  I had this one customer come in with one of the latest Kodak Digital cameras wanting to print the images from it  He took the memory card out  a very flimsy smart card  and told me to print from it Now we couldn’t print from a smart card  so I told him I’d need to transfer it to a CD before printing  which would cost nothing  Either he didn’t understand what I what telling him or he didn’t hear me so I repeated it  He then went in to a full meltdown about how he spent so much on a camera that he can’t print from  that it was a hunk of crap etc etc  Even my manager was telling him that we CAN print but he needed to give us a moment to get the set up to do it  Nope  Customer wasn’t having it and continued his rant only to throw that camera in our bin and shout that he will go an buy a better one……  My manager and I along with a customer or two that were there  just looked at each other bewildered  We retrieved the camera from our bin  downloaded the images and found a picture of the mans driving licence  We then packaged up the camera and posted it out to him with a CD copy  with a PDP pay postage on receipt label  like hell were we paying out to send him is property which was also damaged after the bin toss   Back then the courier charged a flat rate for delivery with   surcharge if paying on receipt  Not too sure if they do that now  but we never saw that customer again,1673,328
309,ny0am0,1,17,“Your last check will be mailed to you ” Apologies for lengthy post  TL DR at the bottomApologies if this isn’t the proper place for this story  I’ve just really wanted to rant about it for a long time  I worked for a major retailer for about two and a half years  from August of  to December of   I realize that’s not nearly as long as some people stay at jobs but it’s long enough that I was pretty familiar with the management staff  including the store manager  I’d seen many people get hired and many people get fired or quit  I’d worked over my schedule  worked off days  and been generally reliable  Near the end of   my partner at the time was hospitalized for some health complications  I missed a day of work to stay at the hospital with them  I called and spoke to the manager on duty for that day who instructed me to use their automated call out line  I  did forget to do this but I returned the next day and apologized and asked if there was any way to overlook it due to the circumstances  They gave a vague answer which I took to mean they’d handle it for me  Perhaps this was arrogant of me to think  but I expected that my performance and reliability would have granted me some leniency  Regardless of whether I was right or wrong to believe that  I was fired  I tried to clock in the next day  only to find my badge and employee number wouldn’t work  I spoke to the store manager and one of the assistant store managers who explained that because I hadn’t used the automated line for calling out  my absence had been entered as a “no call  no show”  I didn’t beg for my job or bother wasting my time discussing options for returning  I was too angry and my partner was still in the hospital  I did however ask about my final paycheck  as I would need it to pay my rent  The store manager says “your last check will be mailed to you ” I leave  and begin looking for other jobs  Being unemployed for any amount of time would make paying my share of rent for my apartment difficult  I wasn’t able to immediately find anything that was full time with a rate that would keep me in my apartment  But all was not lost  I had some money saved up  And I did have at least one more check coming in the mail within the next week or two  I did find a part time job that I started while I kept looking for something full time  After three weeks I called the store I’d been fired from and spoke to a different manager who assured me all final checks are sent in the mail after termination  By this time  the complex had already given notice to my roommates about our rent being a little late  I assumed my check was just lost in the mail but still on its way  I kept looking for better work and kept working the PT job I had   Eventually the complex informs me that we have now incurred a late fee  in addition to the rent we already owe  As everything begins to close in on me  I get a message from a former coworker who still worked at the store  Something close to “hey  do you know you have a check here  HR’s been holding it” I respond simply  “no I didn’t know that  Thanks ” I immediately go to pick up this check  furious at being lied to and having my money simply held  I ended up speaking to the assistant store manager who had been in the room during the discussion where I was told how I would receive the check  I told him “that’s my money  and you’ve been holding it here after I was told it would be mailed  That belongs to me and you’re going to give it to me ” Maybe that sounded a bit extreme but I didn’t  and still don’t  care   He said something back that I don’t remember  I knew he didn’t like what I said but he didn’t have a choice  So he gave me the check and I left  fuming  It was not enough to pay the rent and late fee and we were eventually evicted  But if I had received it sooner  it would have covered my share of rent for the month  with some left over to help with the next  I know it was a simple mistake that led to me getting fired  I do accept that responsibility  My frustration comes from the fact that I was told twice my check would be in the mail  while it was sitting in a cabinet in a desk for weeks TL DR  worked at a store for   years  did overtime  worked off days  worked nights for months on a remodel  fired for missing a day when partner was hospitalized  did not receive my last check in the mail in time for rent  was evicted afterwards,4418,857

311,nxx8ic,1,95,“If you can’t give me a deal on this  I won’t shop here” So this has surprisingly occurred twice within one week but a customer would come in looking for a couple of ties  Our ties have no deal with them and are     each  A man comes in  grabs  ties and asks “is there a deal for three ties considering I am getting multiple ”“Unfortunately not” I saidApparently this guy didn’t like my answer and expected to bend to his will because he replies with “are you able to give me a discount since I am wanting to buy   If not I will not shop here for anything else”“Yeah I can’t do anything in regards to giving a discount on products unless there is a pre existing deal with it” I said  The next thing he said made me want to actually laugh though “Are you sure  Because I really need these ties”  I shake my head and repeat that “unfortunately there is nothing we can do” so he walks out talking about how “we are losing a valued customer and lots of money”Sure thing dude,988,186

314,nxhix5,1,0,When your own workers dont have common sense I called one of our store locations today after a customer stated she was denied a refund because they didnt have enough cash in the register  I advised this can happen in the mornings but it should have been put back onto her card if not  The customer said the worker straight up  a keyholder mind you  told her that since it was done as debit  she is only allowed to give cash back and since she doesnt have enough money  the customer will have to return later  So I called the worker like WTF  She said   I was trained to only put it back on a card if it was credit and only give cash back for debit   I was like so you refused to put it back on her card because its debit  She said yes  I straight up had to explain to someone who has been working for us since  that a debit card refund can be put back on the customers debit card and we shouldnt be denying returns when they have everything they are supposed to  I mean how ridiculous  Never heard of such an insane thing  Shes gonna love having her manager call and be like wtf no one trained you like that 🙄,1126,219

317,nwv0ep,1,31,Guy Upset Over Checks So ive talked about the hellscape that is the store I work at for my evenings weekend job  The thing about this place is weve strict  Or supposed to be strict  but the boss friends are immune to the rules cause friendship  rules regarding checks  Rules that vary depending on if its a paycheck or a checkbook check  Our store identifies paychecks as those obnoxiously large checks that come with a paystub that you get from your employer  where everythng is printed on the check and not written in via pen  Its payroll checks We only do cash back for  dollars  so if youre not buying anything you can only write a check for   If you buy something  its  over your total  so still   For paychecks we only do   and there is a charge you have to pay if youre check is larger than    A lot of people get upset over this  because the boss lets some people write checks for  and not buy anything because shes buddies with them  Others get upset because they are regulars and the rules shouldnt apply to them  Now this one guy  hes an adult  probably in the   range if Im to guess  he comes in every few weeks with checks  checkbook checks written out to him that he wants to cash  says theyre his paychecks and maybe they are  its not my job to investigate where the checks came from and why they were given to him  The thing is  by the store rules  they dont qualify as paychecks because they are torn from a checkbook and are written out in pen as opposed to being a payroll check  Usually these checks have ranged from  to   so they are well over the limit were allowed to cash for those kinds of checks  He always gets upset and argues that we let him do it last time  I always return that I am not responsible for them breaking the rules  that Ive told him prior that we dont cash checkbook checks that large out Monday was kind of a rough day between numerous disasters at my day job and at this one I was stuck with a newbie who didnt want to work and a closer who was  hours late  The guy comes in with two checks that would have totaled out as over   I explained that we cant cash them out  do the same song and dance with him complaining that we always let him cash it and me reiterating the rules we have regarding checks  He lashed out and yelled   Where am I supposed to cash these f           checks if you wont let me do it here    like he was loud enough that I had people in the back turning to look   I admit  with how stressful that day had been I snapped back  and told him that maybe its time he start taking them to an actual bank  He tooks his checks and stormed off  I honestly doubt hes bothered to go to a bank  probably went to some other gas station and complained until they cashed it for him  Ill probably see him again in a couple of weeks  and well do it all over again  this is such a common thing tho  people trying to cash their checks here and being upset that we wont  is there like a reason people refuse to cash their checks at banks,3050,583

325,nvojie,1,14,Customer yelling at employees For a bit of context  I work at a retail store  in the shoe area  I havent been working there that long  but at the store  customers have to wait in line in order so workers can scan the shoes on a device and get them out of the stockroom  Before  customers could walk up to any worker and ask them to scan their shoes  But the policy has changed recently to them waiting in line  Today  I was walking past the line to scan shoes when the lady at the front called me  She was trying to talk to one of my coworkers  but she only spoke Spanish  My coworker doesnt speak any Spanish  but I do  so I asked her how I could help  She told me the shoe size she wanted  and so I told my coworker  My coworker already had her size  but she was telling him something in Spanish  and because he didnt understand  thats why she called me  She asked me why the line system had changed  and being a brand new employee  I asked him  He started to tell me why  but as he was telling me so I could translate for her   all of the conversation between her and I was in Spanish  she said  You have to tell me    So I explained to her that Im new  so I didnt know about the change  but I then told her the reason my coworker gave  After I told her  my coworker went to the stockroom to find her shoes for her  Then she started to rant about how she was busy  and that she didnt have time to wait all day  She told me how stupid it was how she had to get back in line for each shoe she wanted scanned  I suggested to her that perhaps it would be better to find all the shoes she wanted  and then wait to scan all of the shoes  She didnt really respond to that  instead reiterating how stupid the stores system was  She started yelling  and everyone in the shoe section was looking at her  I tried to calm her down  apologizing for the wait  but nothings working  She continues ranting about how busy she is  and periodically she keeps snapping her fingers at me and telling me to bring me her shoes  My coworker already had told her that he would bring her shoes to her  but anything that I told her seemed to go through one ear and out the other  because even though I would tell her that my coworker was bringing the shoes  she kept telling me to get them for her  My manager  who was at one of the registers saw that the customer was getting riled up  and so she called me from across the room to send the woman over  I told the customer to come with me  but she wouldnt budge  I explained to her that my manager would be able to help her with whatever she needed  She just kept asking me  Why  Why are you making me get out of the line   So eventually my manager had to leave the register and walk over to us  I went on my lunch not too long after  and I spoke to the same coworker who got the customers shoes when I came back  My coworker has been working at the store for a couple of years now  and he told me that hes never seen the manager get that overwhelmed before  The way Im describing the story may not seem so intense  but this woman was getting wild,3098,608

333,nsyr1i,1,6,Old guy yells at me while I help his wife pick out a vibrator  So  if the title and my post history isn’t self explanatory I work in a sex store  The stories I could tell just from my year here could fill a book  particularly because I work in a rather “methy” small town in Canada I also work late shifts most nights so  it gets Interesting Anyways tonight I had  fine glossy eyed specimen enter my store and they set off a few retail red flags immediately  so I kept an eye out  but offered my assistance and didn’t bother them while they looked around  For some context  everything in my store is under a magnet lock so I have to come over and unlock whatever product they are wanting off the hook  They asked me to come grab a few items off the wall and put them behind the counter while they continued to browse As I head back to the counter I hear a tell tale cardboard rip and see that the lady had ripped a box of lingerie off the hook and was examining it   While swaying drunkenly mind you  I walked over and gently asked for it back from her so I could tape the product back up since the box was all mangled now and she didn’t want it  As I’m turning around to do this she rips off another one I turn around and calmly say “Hey could you just be careful not to rip the merchandise off  I can grab anything if you want to look at it ” She apologized immediately and slurred that she was just trying to see the back  I told her it was not an issue   probably just heavy drunk hands  So I took both items back behind the counter to fix As I did this  Drunk hubby walks up to the counter and raises his voice at me as his wife continues to look around Side note  I’m incredibly upbeat and cheery  that’s just naturally how I am and It works great to de escalate situations  So imagine me genuinely smiling and being helpful through all this Drunk  D Wife  W Me  MD  We’re not spending anymore fucking money here  We would but we don’t wanna buy anything else from you ”M  “Because I asked her very nicely to be careful with the products ”D  “ ITS NOT LIKE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE    I’m coming back tomorrow to speak to your boss ”Me  “okay for sure feel free   I’m just doing my job making sure stuff doesn’t get damaged  Anything else I can help you with ”  my boss will honestly probably tell the guy to fuck off D  “NO  We’re leaving  “W  looking intently at the wall of vibrators “Wait hold on I like this one”D  “Babe lets go  we’re fucking LEAVING  NOW”W  looking at  different vibrators “Wait”D   practically screaming at this point  NO  NOW M  “Can I help you choose from any of those ”D  “I SAID WERE FUCKING GOING NOW”W  “One more minute  Does this one recharge ”Me  “No  not that one  But I do have this one over here that’s   off and is rechargeable   ”W  “It comes in pink ”Me  “Yup right here ”W  “And waterproof  “M  “Absolutely  “W  “Yeah I’ll take that  “So he stands with his arms crossed and brows furrowed while I grab the products for them  then he has to fork over   for all the stuff they grabbed  I happily bagged it all and asked all the basic questions  followed up by my best wishes for a lovely evening  And smiled because he didn’t say another word and I make commission    I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing if he tries to contact my boss tomorrowOh and I took down his license plate and gave  a lil tip there’s a possible drunk guy in a big truck who just left the sex shop    EDIT  my boss messaged me to let me know if dude calls and tries to complain he’ll be asked kindly not to shop at our stores any more  My boss doesn’t put up with abuse of his staff and that’s why I love him,3699,688
334,nqtejh,1,0,I need inspiration to stop listening to my shyness be more forward to get more checkout sign ups  or Im in trouble  Hi  Where I work in retail  more or less every single time we serve a customer we have to try to get them to sign up to our clubcard membership thing  I dislike doing it a bit as its pestering the customer but these sign ups are unfortunately part of the job   we have to get above a loose amount each week or were pulled up on it by management  We cant lie about how many weve gotten so far either as its all on the system  which oddly keeps shaving one or two off my total each week for some reason   Im not the only one who sometimes gets low numbers  some have done worse than me  but anyway  When a customer says theyre not a member after Ive asked them  I usually go to the often ineffective method of saying  Did you want me to sign you up  you get   and then I get cut off where they say no  and then once that happens several times  it badly affects my average for the week One of my colleagues recently gave me an almost fool proof verbal method of getting many more sign ups so I can keep the management off my back  her method is fantastic  she gets a ridiculously high amount using it   but shes much more forward with customers than I am  Sometimes I feel like I cant do it the way she does  Ive only tried it twice and it worked both times  but I actually find it difficult because it just doesnt come naturally to me   I dont want to annoy the customer There are other reasons that really put me off saying what she says using her method  too  Sometimes its just shyness  but other times its because a customer looks irritable and they dont look like they want to be asked about signing up or just dont look likely to agree to it  However  there have also been many occasions where Ive had a chirpy customer that didnt sign up but I bet if Id have used my colleagues method  they would have I care about what people think  I guess  and I dont want to be that pushy guy at the checkout  but I have to be slightly pushy to some degree on the sign ups to keep my proverbial head above water I feel like I need some kind of inspiration different thought process to be forward  What would you think to yourself if you were in this position to make yourself more inclined to throw caution to the wind  Sooner or later I have to employ my colleagues method  I think  so Id welcome any suggestions  Thanks,2467,461
335,nq6rfn,1,0,Why do you have to be so mad  This literally happened a few hours ago so my nerves are still kinda bad  but I work at a clothing store  and our fitting rooms are still closed  Not necessarily due to COVID  but because of the lack of staffing at the moment  I’m also in Texas if that paints a better picture for you  There are huge cardboard screens in front of them saying they’re closed  but they can be moved easily Anyways  I’m folding shirts in my department and I see a man  probably in his early s  having his daughter who was maybe  try on clothes in the fitting room  I approached him and told him they’re closed in which he said ok  and went our separate ways I see his daughter come out and go back in so I approach him again  We’re told to not purposely escalate situations which I was not intending to do  I was actually approaching him to ask for him to at least bring out the clothes they don’t want if they’re going to ignore the sign Before I even get to say anything he comes up to me  literally within inches of my face  and says “How am I supposed to know what fits my daughter if they’re closed ” Which is not a completely abnormal question  though maybe a stupid one  which I had an answer to if he wasn’t in my face  I should’ve had just called security  but I went to a manager instead  He ended up being allowed to finish shopping  but was told it wasn’t appreciated how he spoke to employees  I was heated so I took a  minute breather  Sorry it’s not a very satisfying ending  but I had to get it off my chest TL DR   year old man gets in a  year olds face because he doesn’t know what size his daughter wears  There were no consequences,1685,321
336,nn9wnq,1,18,Impatient customer cussed me out because there was a line for checkout and I wasn’t helping him first  Oh boy this is a fun one for sure  I haven’t gotten a lot of crazy people in my time  as I’m new to this working thing  but this guy is someone I will remember forever The customer will just be labeled as C for this story So one afternoon I was working with my manager  We were cleaning up the store and I was helping her with whatever she needed  After our shifts had been going on for awhile she decided to take her lunch break  While she was gone the store became very crowded  and soon there was a line for checkout  Four or five people were waiting  and I was trying to get through the transactions as efficiently as possible Three guys were looking at the top shelf of product  and wanted to see for themselves what it looked like and how much it was  So they took it upon themselves to grab our step stool and go up there themselves  I see this out of the corner of my eye and panic  because I’ve never had that happen to me before and I didn’t want C to fall  We also have multiple signs saying “DO NOT GRAB FROM HIGH SHELVES  please ask for an associate to help ”I finish a transaction and get to them right before they go up again and it kinda goes like this   Me  Excuse me sir please do not use the step stool C  I’m just going up there really quickly Me  That stool is for employees only  If you would fall that would be a liability issue C  I’m not going to fall  Almost in a scoffing tone Me  If you could please give me a moment I will help you when I can Pushing the stool away from the trio  I go over to the few customers back in line  They were my current priority and since no one else was available on the floor I was hoping the guys would just wait the couple of minutes They didn’t seem to get the memo The one box that they managed to grab from the top shelf was tossed onto the floor    worth of product that was prone to breaking mind you  They all get ready to leave and as loudly as I can I remind them to “Have a good day ” They all mock my voice  as it is higher in pitch  and the leader of the group says “Thanks for the dumbass help ” They eventually tried to come back  but my manager was there and didn’t let them in  I guess that’s karma for you,2319,444
337,nk7z9g,1,0,When a customer called security on me for following COVID protocol  You guys are getting a three for one  as it all happened in the same day     ———————Me   MeC   Customer C   Customer C   Customer ———————It’s a very long story  sorry about that 😅———————As this is my first post I’d like to just give a broad overview of what kind of store I work in  Just a retail store in a mall  nothing too crazy  We mostly get parents with young kids or groups of teens coming in  Unfortunately the people in talking about today are all adults C walked in with her mask under her nose  you can see where this is going already  and seemed super nice at first  She did exactly as I asked in regards to fixing her mask  took a   and quickly left  Well that was odd  She ripped off her mask  and tried to make a scene in the front saying very loudly C  “Yeah because apparently keeping my mask above my nose is going to stop me from dropping DEAD ”  Big emphasis on the dead I just ignored her and was helping out other people  turning up my music just a little bit louder as I did so  I was just a bit amused as she was  by all means  a grown woman C was nothing too special  the same as C but was mature enough not to make a scene  Just kind of scoffed at me and left after my “Excuse me ma’am would you be able to put your mask up ” question that I use with everyone My shift was quickly coming to a close  and it was still really busy in the mall  Let me set the scene  There was a line at checkout  I was on the phone with my manager  talking about how to do a refund properly   and there were still a good amount of people in the store  For  minutes before closing it was super hectic  Second to last person in the checkout I see them  C and another guy  he didn’t come into the store luckily   Super tall  full beards  and best of all they had no masks in sight 🙃 They were quickly approaching my store and it filled me with the worst amount of dread  Hating confrontation does that to a person Under my breath I’m chanting  “Please don’t come in  please don’t come in  please don’t come in ” The lady at the counter turned around in confusion at what I was referring to  and I said simply  “They aren’t wearing masks and I don’t want to deal with that right now ”C walks into the store guns blazing  wanting to test his luck  It’s a pretty small store and he’s a pretty big guy  so he makes it about halfway in before I get to him  mid transaction might I add  And what followed is something I’ll never forget Me  “Excuse me sir do you have a mask you can wear ”C  “I don’t have to wear it because I’m exempt ”Me  “I’m sorry but it doesn’t work that way  you need to wear a mask ”C  “Oh security is right outside  you don’t want me to go get them do you ”Me knowing that security will in fact save me  “Oh you can go get them it’s okay ”As I ring up the last customers  manager still on the phone with my confused manager  I see the guy grab a  poor security guard and bring him to the front of the store  Though I couldn’t hear the conversation going on  I did see the guard point to our signs  The signs that say masks are required to enter the business  So the guard escorted the man away from the store  and he was glaring at me the whole time it happened ———————Please note that in this moment I am completely aware of the laws in my state  and what the mandate actually says  If people are medically exempt from wearing a mask there are alternatives and other protocol to work with that  If you’ve read this to the end dang  That means a lot  Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this  and I’m sending good vibes your way 💜✨,3704,707
338,niz9kc,1,12,Covidiot on my first MOD Close So about a month ago I got my alarm code to be the closing manager on duty  I work at a large big box type store in Canada  One hour after the mid manger leaves I have a man come in without a mask  I ask him politely to put on a mask  he refuses  He claims a medical exemption  I sympathize however inform him that it is government and store mandated  I offered him a free face shield  He claims a medical exemption to face shields    I then offer that he could order online from his car and we would bring the product out to him  Only takes about  minutes  He explodes a stream of profanities on me at this point demanding to speak to the boss that’s me   I tell him he needs to leave  He demands all my info and the corporate hotline and storms out  First night solo went AMAZING  Wear a mask folks,836,164
339,nirp0v,1,0,TW  Assa lt  Got into a physical altercation with a customer    Okay im posting this because i’m still kind of shaken up   And needing a lil advice from the people   So just a backstory  it’s this “customer” well not really a customer cus he never buys anything lol   The only time he comes in is with the sole purpose to steal   Now don’t get me wrong  I don’t care about stealing  and I’d rather not engage with a customer because you never know their intentions   But Management said he’s a big problem to the gas station  because he’s a klepto   He’s stolen people’s phones  purses  everything   It’s so bad the store had to press charges against him and honestly he’s not even allowed in the store because the store has a whole restraining order against him   well anyways   i was told if i see him  alert authorities   now me being an empath b tch lol  i wanted to spare this dude considering he has a lengthy record   but i also wanted to protect my job   so the first time he came in on my shift  i asked him to leave   he argued with me at first but then left   now other cashiers have told me they’ve never had an issue with this dude when asked to leave and he never came back   but now i’ve noticed he repeatedly comes in the store when i’ve asked him to leave and not come back once before   so now i’m starting to feel like he’s taking advantage of me   of the fact that i am a small girl  and i was the only one on duty at the time   i asked him about four times to leave the store  out of one of those times he threatened to alert the authorities on me just because i was doing my job by asking him to leave and telling my manager  i laughed   but the last time he came in the store  idk it just kind of activated my fight or flight mechanism in my brain   he came in yelling  irate asking “where the lightskin b tch at   i wanna talk to her” so i came to the front and started yelling back at him   i really didn’t know what to do except for to just push him out of the store   i tried pushing him telling him to leave the store  but this escalated into a whole vi lent altercation   he threw me to the ground and b at me all on the top of my head   i didn’t fight back i just shut down at that point   once he got off me i called the cops on him and now he’s sitting in jail on an assault charge   i quit my job voluntarily because the incident has really scarred me kinda   but some people are starting to make me even feel bad for instigating the fight when my main goal was to never hurt him  just get him to leave   idk how to feel tbh   in the moment i felt like i was acting in defense  but now i just feel sh tted on,2642,544
340,nhg1j5,1,33,Man seems to have it out for me for no apparent reason So the past few weeks I have been in charge of training the new cashiers at my grocery store  last week I was training a new guy and it was  minutes till we went home  So I turn out out light and continue to help him bag As many of you probably know people don’t always acknowledge that the light is off  whether they just don’t care  or they don’t notice the light is off  But we don’t normally turn people away unless it’s close to our clock out time  about   minutes before clock out  So it hits    and we’re supposed to clock out at   So I head to the front of the line and I reach for the belt to close off the line when I hear someone come up behind me  So I turn around and see this man who I’m familiar with  and I tell him “oh I’m sorry  we’re closing up for the day  it’s time for us to go home”  And the man goes “no it’s fine” Which I assume means “I understand  you have to go home”  However he doesn’t move  and I assume maybe he misunderstood me  So I say “it looks like register  has a short line  he can help you out there”  And again he says “no it’s fine”  So I finally understand he means “no I’m just going to wait here and you’re going to take me here”  Now I’ve never had anyone do this before  so I was so shocked that I just let him come through  bagged his stuff  and left without telling him to have a good day So I assumed this was going to be a one time thing  this guy usually isn’t the most polite but he’s not normally that big of a jerk either  But today he proved me wrong So today me and my trainee for this week we’re about to go on break  My friend at customer service walks over and turns our light out and lets us know we’re good for our break  But when she walks past the bagging station she leans over and whispers to me “don’t look at register ”  Of course this gets my attention and so I do  And this same man is standing there  staring at me  Now register  has been empty all day  I’ve been bagging for my trainee and helping her with the register  it’s not my job to be checking at that moment  So I just ignored him  because he chose to walk up to a closed register and assume he would get service Then when he finally realized I wasn’t going to walk over and help him he walked into my trainees line  although  again  the light was off  but I truly wasn’t in the mood to argue with him  and I just let him come through  Because I desperately wanted my break  But I really couldn’t tell you what his problem with me is,2543,507
341,n6uqs4,1,14,“a  minute wait  that’s atrocious ” I’ve only recently started working at retail and I have so many stories of awful customers already  On my second ever shift  I was a runner handing out food to parked cars  It was  in the morning  I was tired and doing my job well  As I was handing the food to a car a man a few cars down starts honking his horn yelling at me to get my attention  I finish serving the customer and get to him  He begins complaining to me that he’s been sat in the parking lot waiting for  minutes and still hasn’t gotten his food  As I am a new recruit and not taught how to deal with this situation I tried to calm him down and saying “I’m sorry to hear that  do you maybe have a receipt or anything so I can hand it to the manager and get your food out to you ” however he cut me off instantly after the ‘sorry’ and said “I don’t want to hear your f  king excuses  get me my refund now” shocked at his response I quickly head inside the store and talk to the manager  She seemed very confused but said she would deal with it all and I calmed down and went back to doing my job  As I’m handing out the food again he honks and yells at me again  threatening to assault me and wreck the store if he sees me outside again without his refund  I try to ignore it and go on with doing my job  Finally after a few moments a manager gives him his refund and the food   so I get a sense of relief thinking he will finally leave and I can stop worrying about him  However  as I’m serving a customer he drives by and proceeds to throw all of his food at me  but misses  and threatens me again  I head inside and try to tell the manager everything but of course I get chocked up and go to the restroom to calm myself down    Why do people like this exist  How unlucky am I to have this happen to me on my first time ever being a runner  I swear I considered quitting that day and was so close to    Has anyone else dealt with someone so difficult so early into their employment,2001,400
342,mxv308,1,1,A little happy post about a kind customer ❤️ I was at work at a full serve gas station when I started to feel really sick  Nothing covid related just extreme nausea and dizziness  I’ve had vertigo in the past so I assumed it was just a flair up of that  It hadn’t been super busy that day so I sat down and called my boss  My coworker was on his way to cover the rest of my shift when a customer came in and saw me sitting  I put up my best front but was feeling really ill  He caught on and noticed that another car had pulled up for gas and offered to pump it for me  He did so and even rang them through  I thanked him profusely for his help and he told me it was no problem  By this point my coworker had come and I got to go home and rest up  but I’m still super grateful for this kind stranger,800,167
343,mwzp94,1,6,My first customer service award  Sorry in advance  this story doesnt have all that much spectacle  Just feeling proud and wanting to share If youve seen  my previous post here  https   www reddit com r TalesFromRetail comments mlkp old lady forgets her bank card nice lady saves  utm source share amp utm medium webx amp context    you may remember that I just recently started working as a cashier at a major grocery chain in the Pacific Northwest  Yesterday  I had an  hour shift  I had just gotten back from lunch  arriving back a little late because of a bloody nose  Allergies suck  but luckily my manager was understanding and gave me a little while to collect myself and rehydrate before going back on the registers Not long after logging back on  I get a customer who had three separate orders for a grocery delivery service  I do my usual thing and start making pleasant conversation  and he seems receptive  While Im scanning the stuff from the first order  my supervisor  not the manager  comes over to have me sign a thing regarding the  extra minutes or so that I took to clean up after my lunch break  The customer notices her and asks if theres a feedback survey he can fill out  There is  but apparently its down for upgrades  He informs her that hed like to give me an   out of   review  given my general friendly demeanor  We both thank him for saying so  and she tells him shell let the manager on duty know  The rest of the interaction is pretty standard  save for three separate transactions with the same customer Fast forward a few minutes  Its gotten fairly slow  and I only have a couple people in line  The same supervisor comes up to me and just sorta stands there  I ask her if somethings up  and she says shell tell me once Im done with the line  Immediately  I assume I did something wrong  This is still a new job  and I dont want to mess it up this early  I finish the line and turn to face her  fearing the worst Thats when she hands me a little business card style coupon for   off my next grocery purchase  I ask her why  and she explains that its because of the glowing review from the delivery customer earlier  Im a bit surprised  Ive only gotten one award like this before  and it was for when I volunteered at a local e cycle shop   A story for another time  perhaps   I thank her profusely  and promise to keep it up as best I can  She leaves  the next customer comes up  and I go back to my work  I ended up using that coupon after my shift to pick up some stuff Ive been needing Between this and my last post here  its nice to know that theres a not insignificant number of good customers in my town  This job might just be worth it after all  Thanks for reading,2746,473

349,ly383t,1,45,Woman got upset with me because I did what she asked I work at a grocery store and today this lady came through my line  She placed her items into  separate piles  and handed me an item and told me “this is a go back” and then said “oh and those too”  referring to the pile in the back  and so I assumed that the items behind the first pile were go backs  but just to be sure I asked “so these are also go backs ” And she said yes So I scan the first items  and put the others aside  She looked at the screen all weird  and at her stuff and so I thought maybe I had made a mistake  and was just about to ask when she inserted her card  so I assumed she’d figured out whatever was confusing her and that everything was ok  Then I handed her her receipt  and she looks at me and says what about that stuff over there  At this point I’m really confused and I explain that i was under the impression that they were go backs  She then got super angry saying that only the first item was a go back  and that she wanted to buy everything else  She continued to go on about it while I rung up her other items,1104,224

352,ltyn0g,1,34,a bigger quantity always saves you money  Alright heres a short encounter I had today with a customer  I am a cake decorator and in our cake case we have cupcakes      ct packages  Pretty standard  Well this morning a customer asked me to take two  ct cupcakes from the floor and put them  into a  ct container and charge her for the ct instead because she said it would be cheaper    I wouldnt do that anyway because taking the cupcakes out would mess up the frosting on the sides    A  ct package costs    whereas if she got the two  cts It would be    all together so actually its cheaper to get the two  and I told her this and she got really upset and basically told me I was wrong and that getting a bigger quantity always saves you money  I showed her on my calculator the two ct prices together and she still didnt believe me and she didnt get any cupcakes at all and said she was going to a different store,951,186
353,ltdv6z,1,39,Rude customer forced to apologize to me So this is a story from my first job ever  For some backstory  I worked at a department storefor three years and was working in the lawn and garden tolls section of the store  Took me some time to get use to it and learning about the specs for the merchandise was a bit of a pain but I managed with the help from my coworkers and they are awesome  miss them like crazy since I left but I do contact them from time to time  Story time  Ive been working there for a year and a half by the time and a pretty big snow storm was about to hit the next few days so we had a lot of people in the store wanting snow throwers  shovels etc  Outside the store chained up were some returned used snow throwers at a lower price but they make us some decent commission  more if a protection plan was added  This guy comes in and since I wasnt with anyone at the moment  our cashier directed him to me for help  He comes up to me asking if I could help with a snow thrower outside and I said sure  Jerk  as to what Ill refer to him by now going forward  started out decent in the beginning and was somewhat impressed that I knew better ways to take care of the snow thrower  thank you V  not using his full name  those extra details helped a lot  Jerk said he needed to check something else in the store but told me hed come back to me when he was finished for the sale  I said sure thing and placed a sold sign on it  About  minutes later he comes back and asks for me to finish the sale  I rung him up with no PP  protection plan  since  I gotten this a lot   his friend is a mechanic   Didnt hurt my numbers much since I had sold a much more expensive model with a yr plan The sale is done and I go with him to unlock it for since it was chained and had a security tag on it  no clue how that helped but I didnt care much  him and he asks if I can get a wrench to loosen the bolts  We go inside and this is where he went from kind to a jerk Jerk   So what about its horsepower  How much does it have  Me   Snow throwers dont go by HP they go by CC  Jerk   But do you know the conversion  Me   No not really  Jerk   So you dont know much else about the machine then  Just the basics and a bit more how to maintain it  Me  now knowing where this is going but trying to stay polite   Sorry but when it comes to more details like what youre asking me  I dont really know much else  This dude didnt go livid or anything like that  but was annoyed  He started insulting my knowledge  calling me an idiot and then said the company hired me because they were sorry for me  I normally am a very patient person  not wanting to argue unless I have to and I never been in an actual fight but I can hold my own if need be  Almost was in one though but that was before I worked there and that would be another story if I ever remember the details Also I was hired there cause my older brother worked for them also as a store manager  so there was reputation with our name at the store  Him being a store manager and me being one of the top sellers for my department  The manager who hired me didnt know we were brothers until he saw our last name and this was after he said I was hired Anyway  I was done with this guy and I told him also  I went back inside with him demanding the wrench to loosen the bolts but I told him no and tossed it back in to our tool box  He was annoyed and demanded a manager which the cashier called to get him to shut up and out of the store  Another coworker went with the wrench and loosened it for him  About  minutes later my managers came to the front of the store and asked Jerk what was wrong and he told them  However  my coworkers heard the insults and told the managers what he said  They called me over the PA system as I was away from the check out and away from him  I went over and this is what I came back to M   You need to apologize to my associate right now  How dare you insult him while hes been nothing but kind and patient to you  We dont take kindly to customers being rude to them Jerk   somewhat half assed   Sorry Me   Apology accepted  M   Good  now you may leave  We are done dealing with you  The guy left shaking his head and I thought he was muttering to himself but I didnt care anymore  My managers came up to me and said to not worry about him and that it was a smart idea to get away from him incase the situation escalated  They know that I have a lot of patience but even I have my limits  We spoke for a few minutes so I can just get that jerk out of my mind and my floor manager  who is a nice Jamaican older woman and the one who mainly spoke to Jerk  said  I hope that thing breaks while hes using it  He didnt buy a plan right   I shake my head and she said  Good cause I dont want him here or the repair center at all  I had a smile on my face for the rest of the shift  That remains my favorite moment of my life to this day  I currently work in a supermarket since I didnt return to the sporting goods store cause of the pandemic and my manager there is pretty chill also and I told him the story and said that hed do the same if that ever happened  I had a smug smile the whole time typing this out Edit  it was a  stage snowblower  For some reason I’ve just been calling them snow throwers despiste the subtle differences even a little before I left the company due to work becoming scarce  And with the horsepower part  the snowblower was about cc and even then I didn’t remember the conversion but it’s around hp,5575,1090
354,lsno3t,1,147,Why dont customers  or their spouses  actually listen to what we say  To give a little background  I work in a small store that specializes in pet supplies  There are  locations that all sell the same items  more or less   One of the things we sell is birdseed  It comes in jugs or bags  The bag is more than double the volume of the jug  but less than   more in price  We received  jugs and  bags of birdseed today and my colleague called a customer who had requested we put a couple aside for her  He said he had to leave a voicemail  as the customer didnt answer her phone  About an hour after my colleague left for the day  I received a call from the customers husband  The following is the conversation I had with him Me  We received our shipment today  and wanted to confirm that you wanted  jugs  Is that still the case  Youd save money by purchasing the bag  instead  Husband  Can we get  jugs  I didnt save my jug the last time   I recycled it  Can it be delivered tomorrow along with our food  Me  I can certainly do that  but are you sure thats what you want  If you buy  bags  youre saving money and have roughly the same amount of birdseed  I can send you whatever youd like  The food is ready to go   Husband  I dont have the jug anymore  Whats the price difference Me  Explain all the math   price savings as well as product volume  Also state that I can send  bags tomorrow as thats what I have to sell him  Husband  Oh  Ill take  bags  then  Me  Sir  Im sorry  I have  bags physically here in the store that I can sell you if you want them all tomorrow   Husband  OK  Ill take  bags then  That and the dog food  Me  mentally hitting my head on the counter   Sure  Ill send you  bags  Your total for the three bags and food comes to  whatever amount   If youre all set  Ill charge the card on file and my driver will see you tomorrow some time  Husband  Oh  yes  The credit card  Do you have my wifes card Me  Yes  Its on file  Ill charge it later today and she will receive an email receipt  Husband  Wonderful  Well see you tomorrow Me  Have a great day I called the location closest to the customers address  Luckily they had a couple of bags come in  so they were able to supply the missing bag  Why is it so hard for people to actually listen to what you tell them,2360,444
355,ls9b03,1,134,Minutes of my time wasted   Customer has me help them only to complain and leave cart at store So I work at a craft store chain with several stores in the area  Im a cashier  but since we have so many cashiers I often work on the floor when we arent as busy  Thanks to C   weve been having slow incomes of stock pilled on top of customers buying more supplies than usual since they are stuck at home having to do crafts  To set todays scene  I was returning items to the shelves when I got stopped by an interesting customer  C   CustomerMe   MeCK   Customers Kid CK   Customers Kid OSW   Other Store WorkerOSM   Other Store Manager C   Hello  do you have this style of yarn in stock  Me   Let me check  C shows me her phone and I find the item thats on our app  Theres a skew there which I look up  and it shows that we are out  Me   Im sorry  it looks like we are out of that yarn  C   Do you have any in overstock  Me   No  we do not  our list of stock details all stock  including overstock  C    sigh  When will you be getting more  Now  I need to emphasize that processing is not my field of study in this job  as I am normally a cashier  But I do know that we get new shipments in on Mondays  but yarn has been coming in increasingly sparingly and we havent gotten many new shipments in a while due to low supply  Me   Due to delays and low stock thanks to the pandemic  we are not able to tell when any new shipments of that yarn will arrive  C  beginning to look frusterated   Are you SURE there isnt any in overstock   Me   Im positive  We do not even have an overstock location set for this type of yarn  as we havent had overstock for it yet  As we are having this beginning to be repetitive conversation  CK and CK arrive out of nowhere  CK asks her mother a question CK   Moooommm  I need to go to the bathroom  C   Have CK take you  CK   But I dont know where the bathroom is   Keep in mind  these two children are young  The oldest  CK  looks to be maybe  years old  while CK is about  years old or so  Me   The bathroom is right around this corner   I point the direction C  shooing her kids off   Yeah  yeah  go   switches back to me  Are there any other stores that may have the yarn  Me      I can check  Can you please give me a moment   checks scan gun for other store availability  It looks like nearly every single store in the nearby vicinity is out as well  Though there is Random Town  RT  thats across the city which may have a few C   But thats so far    I dont want to drive out that far  At this point Im trying to stay as silent as I can  Im not very confrontational at all and tried to let the situation calm down as it could  C was beginning to look really infuriated from such a small thing  and I wasnt one to fuel the flames Me   I understand your frustrations  but Ive checked every single store that could possibly be nearby and every single one is out of stock except for RT  C   Fiiiiine  but Im going to call them to make sure they have it  Ill spare the most of the  minutes she had me help her set up a call with the other store  She insisted I stay and help her call  even when I had maNY other things I could do instead  During this time  her children had returned and were clearly desperate for their mothers attention  but C was physically shooing them off because this call was apparently more important  Eventually  C got on the phone with the other store after calling  times  C   Hello  can you check if you have this specific yarn in stock  I have the skew number here  OSW  Other Store Worker    Sorry  we arent able to do that since we are busy right now and dont have anyone avalible on the floor to check that  C   But I need to see if you have this yarn before I drive all the way out there  OSW   There isnt anyone avalible to check for you right now  C  now visibly frusterated   Can I speak to the manager  OSW      Im gonna put you on hold C  once put on hold  addresses me    Craft Store  has terrible customer service  At this point  I am baffled  C has now just addressed me  a customer service member of said craft store  complaining about the customer service of said craft store  In that moment  I had no clue how to respond and simply awkwardly nodded  What kind of response was I supposed to give   I want nothing more than to get out of this  And  to be fair  I should of  But I was too awkward to ask to leave  So  for  agonizing minutes on hold  I sat with C and her energetic children begging for attention  Eventually though  the Other Stores Manager  OSM  picked up the call  OSM   Hello  C   Hi there  Can you check if you have this item in stock OSM    checks  Im sorry  we do not have any of that yarn in stock  C   But Im at a different store and it says you do have it in stock  OSM   Sometimes the system incorrectly puts in the number in stock when mixing up returns  Our apologizes  C   Are you suRE  OSM   Yes  Im sure  C hangs up and turns back to me  Ill spare the next  minutes  but I managed to negotiate and look at other yarn she may also need for her project and see if she can get that yarn first  It took many more gruelling minutes of shifting through every single isle of yarn we had  but I eventually helped her get a cart full of yarn for her project  As soon as we finished  I was called up to the register to assist with the line  It was extremly hard to hide the visible relief on my face  Though  this isnt the end of Cs story  Luckily enough  even though we had  cashiers at the registers  I was  un lucky enough to get C back at my register when she went up to pay  Her kids were still running around but C didnt even look in their direction  I was desperate never to see Cs face again so I quickly rang her up  The trouble began near the end of the transaction  C    shows me a coupon Me   Im sorry  we no longer accept competitors coupons  C   Since when  Me   Since last March  There are several signs placed around the registers   I point her towards one C   Do you have any other coupons  Me   We have a   off coupon on our website  C   Do you have anything better than that  Me    explains all possible options we have for discounts at our store C   Can I just    can I   AuGH   grabs her purse and kids  Can you put it on hold  Me   Uh   sure   wait Before I could stop her  C nearly ran out of the store with her kids in tow  I tried to stop her to let her know that I needed a name and phone number to put it on hold  but she was gone before I knew it  I was now sitting at my register with an entire cart full of yarn that I spent  minutes helping this lady find  only for her to run out the store and demand I put it on hold  TLDR  Customer has me sit with them for  minutes to make sure they find their yarn  complains about the customer service of our store to my face  only to leave their cart at the register for me to put on hold once they find out they cant use another stores coupon,7098,1378

357,lrz8ib,1,9,Todays my birthday  It reminded be of another birthday story wherein I got the cops called on me because of a misunderstanding  So I used to work at a video game store a while back  We would take games and systems in for trade One day  a woman and her son came in and wanted to trade in the sons Nintendo DS to get something else  Sure thing  I can do that for you   I say as I take the DS  I power it on to test it out  as we do with all system trades  and it plays a startup jingle like most electronics  After I hear the jingle  I smile  and say   Happy Birthday   to the boy   Some of you already know why I said this  if you dont  it will become clear later The boys eyes widened in wondrous amazement  and he turned to his mom and said   Howd he know it was my birthday    with a big smile on his face His mother  however  did not have a smile on her face  It was a scowl  How did you know its his birthday   she asked inquisitively I started to respond   Well  the DS has   but was cutoff by her  Are you the one whos been stalking us   she said  Excuse me   I responded  I was quite taken aback  Youre the one whos been stalking us  Im calling the cops   she yelled  She ripped the DS from my hands and grabbed her sons hand and left the store  She turned to the left and went almost out of view and pulled out her phone  I couldnt hear what she was saying on the phone I should also point out that I was working by myself at the time  and there had been one other customer in the store near the back  She naturally heard everything  the store was rather small  and came up to inquire as to what happened I say   I dont know  she just freaked out when I said Happy Birthday to her son and said she was calling the cops  She responded   Oh  so she doesnt know about the DS jingle   Evidently not  I mean  I feel for her if shes got some issue or something  but yeah  she just kinda flipped out there  I checked her out  just buying some PS games  and I happened to see her trying to talk to the woman when she left  It looked like she was trying to convince her that it was a misunderstanding  but the woman wasnt having it  She stood there indignantly with her son  waiting I could have gone out to try to explain it to her but I thought that it might make things worse  so I decided against it A little while later  another customer came in  and as they opened the door  I heard the mother say   Hes a stalker in there  The guy was obviously confused  and he happened to be a regular  Whats that about   Reg asked me  Just a wild misunderstanding on her part   I say  I explain what happened and we both chuckled Assuming a cop would come to investigate  I prepared for their arrival by getting out a used DS to demonstrate the misunderstanding A few minutes later  I see a squad car turn up  The officer came up to the woman and led her away from the store as he took her statement  Reg and I were just waiting for him to come in Eventually  he did so  Lady said youre stalking her   he asked  with a slight inclination that he didnt believe her  Im guessing she was rambling or something when telling her story  Sorry  Officer     I look to his name badge  Brown  My names Knever  and its really just a silly misunderstanding on her part  She told you I said Happy Birthday to her son  right  He nods  Well  the only reason I figured it was his birthday was because they wanted to sell their Nintendo DS  and theres this feature    I pull out the DS and motion to it  See  when you turn it on  it plays this little jingle     I turn it on and it plays the jingle  Now  the thing is  if you turn it on on the birthday that was set by the user     I go into the settings and change the birthday to the current day  and turn it off      the jingle that plays on startup is noticeably different   and turn it on and it plays the special birthday jingle   Thats the only reason I knew it was his birthday  Officer Brown seems to understand  He takes my information and thanks me and leaves  I see him go out to the parking and talk with the mother  She seems displeased at first but appears at ease after Brown demonstrates on the kids DS what had happened  Even though shes calmed down  he appears to urge her not to come back in the store and leave Reg and I had quite a laugh after Brown left Believe it or not  Ive had a similar experience before this  wherein the mom actually let me explain  and she  the kid  and I were all happily amused,4551,834

362,lqwy5c,1,98,The customer was about to take off I  M  worked at a local grocery store from   before graduating from university and was a well known employee by most all of our customers  I had maybe  negative encounters throughout my  year stint there  but because we were extremely customer oriented I would bend over backwards even for the worst of our patrons  Keeping my mouth shut for so long in a customer service job had finally caught up to me when I knew I was about to triple my income overnight  I had accepted a job and was going to be moving out of state in a week when this happened  I was off of work for the day  but my mother needed some groceries picked up and I decided to go get them for her  The parking lot of our store was on a slope and we often had issues of runaway carts hitting cars  It usually wasn’t a big deal and people would leave a note indicating what happened with their number  As I’m packing up the car with my bags I look over and see a kid riding the cart down the parking lot and I let out a chuckle  come on  everyone does it   My laugh immediately stopped when I noticed he was going full speed towards a pretty beaten down car that happened to belong to one of my coworkers  He hit it full force and left a sizable dent in the drivers side door  His mother appeared out of nowhere  looked around  and quickly took the cart to the area where we store them  I’m sitting in my car watching this happen thinking  “Please God leave a note  Please don’t make me say something ” Sure enough she gets back to her car and opens the drivers side door  Me  You are going to leave a note aren’t you  Lady  What Me  Your kid hit that car and left a mark  You need to do something about it  Lady  Mind your own business it’s not even noticeable and I don’t have paper or a pen to write my information down on Me  If you’re not going to say something then I am  At this point I lost it  Mainly because I only had a week left working there and because I realized I was at the store  but not wearing my work attire and had dreamed of a moment like this for years  Me  You’re good with teaching your kid it’s okay to damage someone’s property and not take responsibility for it   What kind of person does that   What kind of role model are you being  You need to go in the store and tell someone Lady  Leave me alone  I’m leaving  At this point I get out of my car and start walking towards hers  She gets in  rolls the window down  flips me the bird  yells “Fuck you ” and speeds off  I got a picture of her license plate and told our store manager and the employee what had happened  His insurance took care of it  but I wish she had to pay some kind of price  tl dr   I wasn’t wearing my work uniform on a day off and saw a kid hit a car with a grocery cart whose mother let him get away with it and sped off after I yelled at her,2885,561
363,lq9d5c,1,83,Maam  that isnt English So this happened a few weeks ago and I nearly blocked it out of my mind I work in a home improvement store  Its a typical day where its not exactly power hour but its not like Im walking around without anything to do A lady walks ups to me and gets my attention  One very important thing to note is that this lady is Asian  She had broken English but Im going to be putting the proper grammar here Me   Hi  how can I help  Lady   Yes  Im looking for this  She holds out her phone to me  Now this happens quite often as people either want to show a picture  or perhaps they dont speak good English  I live in an area that has a lot of Spanish speakers but also a hefty Asian community  mostly Chinese Mandarin  Shes brought up a text message  and I cannot read it  I barely remember what it was exactly  which is why I didnt know if I wanted to post this story  but I remember   that it started with  La  and then followed by a word that I believe was something like  Cabilla   Note this wasnt the actual word used  but its what my coworkers thought maybe she was trying to look for  more on that later  My Spanish is mediocre at best  I took Spanish in High School but forming sentences is something Im not confident in  Only thing Im good at is numbers and recognizing certain characters   I try to learn from my coworkers bit by bit and we have fun with me trying to learn Me   Oh  sorry Maam  I dont speak Spanish  I can find you an employee who does  The Lady then looks at me like I just took my shirt off and started screaming while she watches me from the other side of a street Lady   Do you speak English  My brain short circuited in that moment  I couldnt comprehend what I just heard  Im so thankful I had a mask on because I couldnt hold back my mouth from expressing the  what the fudge   state  You all know the one When my brain started back up  which to me felt like a good minute  I say back   Uh    I do Maam  Im speaking it right now  I just spoke to you in English before   I rarely ever make a snappy comment like that  both because of anxiety and my attempts at professionalism  This was a line I never thought could have been crossed though  Lady   So do you have this  Read it  Its English   She holds out her phone again Me   Maam  Im sorry  but I do not know what that is  Because that is not English  or at least any word that I have heard of  I can try to find another employee who might know what that is  She then shakes her head   Why does no one speak English here    She walks away in a huff Im left there flabbergasted  Eventually Im able to maneuver myself to some coworkers who spoke Spanish  and I tell them about what happened  Theyre also shocked  but when I asked them what those words meant  when I actually had fresh in my mind what the words were  none of them could identify what she wanted  They reaffirm to me though that use of  La  was most likely Spanish  I eventually find a coworker who theorizes that perhaps she was looking for rebar   which they tell me  Cabilla  is an iron or steel bar   but the Lady  or someone else who sent that to her  had wrote it down wrong  Ive dealt with some customers before  but this was just mind boggling to me  I can only assume perhaps they mistook the use of the Latin Alphabet to automatically assume it was English  I dont hold any kind of negative thoughts to this person  Im very uneducated in regards to identifying languages myself  I understand the struggle of learning a new language in a new country since I did that myself when I lived in South Korea for a few years  Still  Im still just scratching my head regardless  Im gonna give myself a bald spot at this rate,3763,694

373,lbzlp0,1,117,Lady attempted to spit on me TL DR at the bottomNOT a woman refusing to wear a mask story A few months ago  around end of November  beginning of December  a woman came into the girls clothing store I worked at  Now the store I worked at recently closed due to being bought out  A lot of people were mad about that  yelling at the employees and demanding explanation  I wasn’t a manager or anything  so I didn’t really know much  just what I was told  So all I knew was that any purchases made after November th were final sale  no returns or exchanges  The registers are also set up where we have signs saying all sales are final and we have plexiglass between the cashier and customer  This lady came into the store and she looked pretty put together and wealthy  She was wearing form fitting jeans  a sweater  and had nice makeup on  In my area we require masks or face shields  so she had a face shield on it comes into play later   She also had  girls with her  probably  and   Both of the girls were also nicely dressed She walked around for a bit before finally choosing a set of PJs  She walked up to my register and paid for her things  with me telling her  times verbally that all sales were final  We tell them all sales are final before they pay and again when we mark their receipt final sale  She acknowledged me  paid  and went to walk out of the store  On her way out she stopped and looked at the PJs again  She seemed to find another set she liked  so she walked back up to the register  I took her at my register  assuming she wanted to buy the other set  but she slammed the bag of purchased PJs and the other set on the counter and said “I want to exchange these ” I looked at her and said  “I’m sorry ma’am  but all sales are final so I’m unable to do that ” She didn’t like that answer and started saying “I didn’t even leave the store  I was just bought these  do it ” I explained to her again that I’m unable to do that  we didn’t even have the option on the register anymore  She got more and more visibly aggravated with me  She kept demanding that I exchange the items  using so many different excuses like “I just bought them  they are the same price  I didn’t even leave  you didn’t tell me it’s final sale  etc ” Keep in mind  there are signs all over the store saying final sale AND I told her  times  I kept telling her over and over that I couldn’t exchange them  but would be happy to ring it up in a separate purchase for her  She wasn’t having it  She eventually slid her face shield up and spit in my direction  The spit landed on the plexiglass and not on me  but at that point I wasn’t taking it anymore  I’m not sure if she knew the plexiglass was there or not  but either way I was done  I called my manager over and calmly explained the situation to her before stepping back  Now  my manager is very mama bear type  If someone messes with her employees she doesn’t take it  She took one look at the customer and said  “you have  seconds to leave the store or I’m calling security to come in here and drag you out ” The customer was taken aback for a bit  but eventually grabbed the PJs she purchased and stormed out  Her daughters just looked scared and embarrassed of their mom the whole time  The store closed shortly after that  so I’m not sure if anything ever came of it  but let’s just say I’m glad I don’t work retail anymore  TL DR I told a woman I couldn’t exchange her purchase and she tried to spit on my face before my manager forced her to leave,3528,671
374,lbgtm9,1,29,Customer tries to throw me under the bus for  cents I work at a grocery store  I’ve worked at  grocery stores in the past year  I’ve only had one particularly bad customer at my last job  but this one tonight was the worst ever  Also I’m a teenager  I’m a cashier and I was running self check out tonight  A lady comes up to me and tells me that her  for   sale didn’t show up on the receipt  I ask her to hand me the item so I can check to see if the sale is in her system  It’s not and I inform her it’s not in the system and that I can go check for her  I ask her where she got it from and she seemed to get upset over that  so I just leave and walk up to my coworker to ask her  It’s right on the aisle  we check the sale and the expiration date  great the sale is there so we can go correct this for her  So my coworker  she’s trained in front desk  says she’ll handle it  She asks the customer if she’s already paid for it and says ”okay  there’s nothing more we can do  But we can take you to customer service to take it from there ” The customer lady turns to me and says ”Why’d you even try to help me  This was useless ” Which is it’s not because we got all the information she needs to get her refund  Our assistant manager is seeing this commotion and walks over and my coworker tells him she needs a refund  Okay  perfect  his problem now  So another customers walks up and tells me her sale didn’t show up either  At the same time  the previous lady comes up and accuses me of not giving her her receipt back  Now I have  upset customers  so I excuse myself and walk over to the desk to get help  I got so overwhelmed  and both the customers followed me  I manage to quickly tell another front desk person that this new customer needs help  The original lady starts complaining to my manager about the missing receipt that I stole and never gave back to her  I tell them I’ll go check for the receipt because I figured I set it down  She follows me again accusing me of stealing her receipt  I look for the receipt at the self check out stand  I can’t find it  I turn to the cashier who checked her out and ask her if she can print her prior transaction  She can’t because she’s had other customers  My ASM comes back because this lady is yelling at me in front of everyone  I have to dig through the trash for her receipt to see if it’s there  It’s not anywhere  This woman just gets more heated and starts screaming at me more and accusing me  I know now that I handed her back her receipt because I remember I handed it back to her when I went to go check the sale  My ASM is trying to calm her down  I ask if it’s in her purse because I see a receipt in her purse and she got so offended that I asked and handed me her purse  My ASM is like “no we don’t need to do that ” And tries coaxing her to the customer service desk to stop yelling at me in the store basically All of a sudden her receipts in her hand  amp  she’s still yelling at me that I didn’t give it back to her  Where’d it magically come from then lady   My ASM says we’ll get her her refund for   cents  amp  she corrects him and goes “no  cents plus tax ” She got her fucking  cents refund while bitching about me to my manager and how I’m incompetent  She finally leaves and then harasses my coworker from earlier about where to leave her cart  Everyone tries to console me and say it happens to everyone  My mom said I need to stop being such a pushover and verbal punching back  Others say I should’ve been more confrontational because I just stood there and took it  It costs nothing to be kind  but it also costs  cents to be a raging cunt  tldr  customers sale didn’t ring up correctly in receipt  I check sale  we inform her that customer service can issue her refund  She calls me useless for going to check the sale  She comes back and accuses me of not giving back her receipt  My ASM tries to get her to stop screaming at me and take her back to the desk  She continues to scream  then her receipt magically winds up in he hand  continues to accuse me  Gets her refund while complaining about how incompetent I am  Leaves  amp  harasses my coworker about her cart  Refund was  cents,4215,825
375,lb0vv4,1,28,For the Last Time Sir  We Don’t Have Diesel So this happened a week ago or so  and it’s still on my mind as one of the weirdest things to happen to me at work  And I’ve only worked at all for a year  so who knows what the future holds in store  pun slightly intended Some details to preface this  I work in a local convenience store  We sell snacks  tacos and chicken  delicious   and gas  not diesel  hence the title  Although we have the button and spot for diesel on the pump  we don’t actually have it   Also the large majority of our customers are regulars  The man in this story  henceforth known as Diesel Guy  or DG  was not a regular  None of us had ever seen him before  Also  obligatory on mobileSorry if this is long Cast Me  me obviCW  co workerDG  Diesel GuyIt was about pm ish and I still had to wait until midnight to go home  It was pretty slow that day  and my CW was going to leave in two hours to leave me by my lonesome except for the stocker  who’d be around the storeSo as I said  it’s slow  nothing to do  when in comes a guy I had never seen before  We get a lot of regulars but it’s not uncommon to see passerby and what not  He wasn’t wearing a mask but had a cloth over his face  His shirt was dirty and had what seemed to be oil stains  It looked as if he had just been working on a car or something  We get a lot of blue collar workers who come here  so it’s not uncommon to see people looking like that  Anyway  he walks up to the counter and pulls    bills out of his back pocket and places it on the counter  He says nothing and just stares at me  So I wait a moment to see if he says anything  Silent Me  Um sir  what is this forDG     Me  Sir DG   grunts Me  Is this for gas DG     Me  Para gasolina  Note   Many Spanish speakers in this are so I thought maybe he didn’t understand my English DG   vaguely points at gas pumps Ok we’re getting somewhere nowMe  Ok  which pump sir DG   silent Me  dónde DG   holds up two fingers and grunts Me  Ok so   in pump    Just trying to make sure DG     Me  cuatro en dos DG   grunts and leaves Me   shrugs and puts the money on pump  After that I turn to my coworker and ask him what the hell that was and laughed  He said he didn’t know laughed as wellSo  I can see on the screen of register that he’s pumping gas  so I assume that’s the end of it  It wasn’t  This next part is where two things happen  You find out why he’s called DG  He speaks  English at that He comes back in a moment later  half in the store  half out  He looks at me the following exchange happens  DG  Hey do you guys have diesel Me  No sir we don’tDG     Can you put diesel Me  We don’t have diesel DG  But can you put diesel Me  Sir we don’t have itDG  Ok but can you put some Me  We don’t have it sir  We don’t carry itDG  Can you put diesel Me  We physically do not have it sir  I can’t give you what we don’t haveDG     But can you put some At this point I was so frustrated and just ducked behind the counter and my coworker said he’d deal with it  He walks outside with the guy to figure out what happened  CW came back and told me that he had a hard time asking him questions because DG said mostly nothing  even if CW asked him in English or Spanish  Turns out the guy had already pumped the gas he needed  his car didn’t even take diesel  and that was that  Or so I thought  At this point  I don’t remember if I was I break or in the bathroom  but the point is  I wasn’t in the room when this next part happened  So to save time explaining  CW and DG had a similar conversation in which DG tells CW he thinks he pumped diesel and fucked up his car  CW tells him that he couldn’t have messed up his car with diesel because we don’t carry it  This exchange goes on for a while before DG says “you don’t have diesel ”CW  NoDG  Ok  walks out Apparently when they were outside DG said the same thing  realized we didn’t have diesel  To make a long story a little longer  DG was still in the parking lot with his hood open  messing with the engine  Turns out his car wasn’t working because it was over heated  He came in again and CW asked if he needed help with his car and basically had to play charades again to understand that the guy needed a gallon of water to cool of the engine  When CW finally asked if that’s what he needed  DG just walked out the door  CW got him some water  and the engine was cooled off  and DG left  The rest of the night was slow  but that moment made it interesting enough to not care as much,4594,872
376,lb091u,1,32,Card Declined   So I work at a local grocery store chain which has a gas station connected to it  At my town  a national gas station franchise is partnered with my store so our rewards system works with their store and their cards coupons will work with our store depending on the situation  This is important to know for the situation that happened yesterday   A elderly guest with a golf hat  Ill call him Golf Hat Man  GHM  from here on out  came up to the gas station  ready to be checked out  He handed out his card  a holographic green white card that I would usually have to use a different card reader on and then house charge it    GHM   You know how to do this right    Me   Of course   So as Ive said  I would have to use a card reader on my end that would take an amount out of the card and then I would have to house charge it from our system  I swiped the card  entered the amount and proceeded with the transaction  Card Declined  that rarely happens to me  so there must be something wrong with the system I assumed  I called one of my managers to come up and I told GHE that his card was declined   GHE   You said you knew how to work this    I responded telling him that I did know and I am have a manager coming down to support  I believe I also told him again that his card was still declining on my card reader   GHE   Well it seems that you store is false advertising  Clearly it would work at  National Gas Station     I was a bit confused at what he meant by that but it was obvious to me and my coworkers around that he was getting agitated  It was the worst of times for this to happen as well since a line of people was forming right behind him  He was talking about how he got this card and how it would work every time here and other places  around this time my manager came down wondering what was going on as well  She asked if his card was expired to which he looked around asking himself if it was expired   GHE   Look it doesnt say that it is expired at all     There wasnt a expiration date on there  dont think there are expiration dates on those cards so I couldnt blame him there  The situation wasnt getting nowhere  so he went and threw a hundred on the counter   A ripped one at that   Saying that we should get a supervisor being okay that he will go and get his gas somewhere else from now on  cant remember what my manager said but I said yes with no hesitation  He was getting me agitated at that moment  and while I wasnt cussing him out  thankfully  I was acting a bit of a smart ass    I remember the he said to me before he left   GHE   At least I know you name for next time Mr  Know it All  My Name     At that moment I decided  by my own principals  to not have my nametag out for the public  I know Ill get in trouble from my managers for that but Id rather not have another upset guest know about me more than I would want to have  My manager who was there apologized to me for having to take the blunt of GHE  I told her not to worry about it    Apologizes for what I think was a post that went a bit all over the place at the end  Usually I dont like to talk about stuff like this that happens in my life  it makes me feel like Im complaining  But with people like GHE around and a plethora of other people  it makes me glad that Im not alone but at that same time  during a damn pandemic of all things  we all deserve to be treated better than this,3446,685

379,l9zv28,1,104,Why does the birdhouse cost more than the treat  So a while ago I was working in a big chain store for pet supplies   A part of our stock was seasonal products  many of them for wild birds I was working the register on an average day  engaging the the occasional conversation with the customers  when an old lady comes to the register   I ring her up and tell her the total  and she pays with nothing out of order happening   She leaves  but comes back about  minutes later   I ask her if there was a problem  thinking maybe I had accidentally rung something twice or given her the wrong change  despite always being very careful In the following exchange  L is the Lady  M is the managerMe   Is there something else that you need    L       Well  you have typed in the wrong price    Me   Wrong price  Our prices are in the system  but I will have a look    L       See  this bird house is      Me   Yes  thats the right price  The ladys features darkened instantly L       No  you typed it wring  The price tag says its      Me    Oh  I dont think thats right  Can you show me the tag    L       Are you saying I am a liar   This is a scam  You are trying to rob me    Me   No  not at all  But maybe you looked at the wrong tag  A birdhouse cant be    Can you please   show me where you got it    L      This is fraud  You cant do this to me    Me    Please calm down  I will look at the tag    M     Hello  is there a problem    L      This boy is trying to rob me    Me   The lady says the price tag for this says    I asked her to show it to me    M       confused look    Alright  lets have a look then  The lady now finally shows us where she got the item   It was a big basket  with several items displayed next to each other and the pricetags for each one in the front L      See  It says       pointing to the small treats RIGHT NEXT to a bunch of similar birdhouses    Me   No  this is for the treats  Im sorry for the confusion  mam  but it is clearly labled The tags had the product names on them L      No  it was not laying with these  It was on top of these snacks  so this tag is the valid one    M     Well  some customer may have put it down there because its easier than to fit it back in  But this   is clearly not the correct tag  A birdhouse can not    L      I WANT MY MONEY BACK  I WILL CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW    M      Of course we can take the house back  but we cant sell it for    She went on screaming and the manager gestured me to go back inside   A few moments later they went inside  and the lady smugly held out the item   I did the return  gave her back her money and suppressed the urge to roll my eyes L     That will teach you  And I will NEVER come to this store again  She said in a victorious tone I couldnt help but grin widely at that Me   Oh I see  Have a great rest of your life then  She huffed  and puffed  and the manager and I shared a good laugh afterwards,2998,627
380,l9qce5,1,43,What kind of cigarettes are those  So this just happened  I live in the US and the specific state I live in is one that has legalized marijuana both medically and recreationally The store I work at has decided to capitalize on this by expanding the types of papers and wraps we sell  including cones  Cones are just preformed papers shaped well kinda like a cone  the narrow end contains a filter  though much different from a cigarette filter  and the wide end is open for filling The only brand we carry are Zigzag cones which come in a black and orange box  although a box of cones is as tall as a pack of the s size cigarette boxes they are only half the width  only  cones in a box  and theres a picture of an empty cone on the front of the box Had a youngish lady  just old enough to buy cigarettes  come up to the counter and shes looking at the cigarette selection when she asks  what kind of cigarettes are those  Those orange ones  I turn and point to the orange pall malls and ask  you mean these   The lady shakes her head  no up a few more rows and to the right Now Im confused bc the orange box pall malls are the ONLY orange box of cigarettes we sell  the only other orange anything were the zigzag orange papers and the black and orange box of cones which are right next to the papers    And did I mention they were only half the width of an actual box of cigarettes    So really skinny So I really didnt think they could actually be mistaken for a box of cigarettes but ask anyway if she means those bc Im out of other orange options and lo and behold thats exactly what she meant So then I had to explain that they werent cigarettes just empty cones and what they were for  she just ended up getting a box of L amp Ms and leaving,1779,331

384,l9fc83,1,25,TLDR  I had to teach a person how to use a phone I’m not the greatest storyteller  but this story was too good not to tell  Obligatory “sorry for typing on mobile” message here  I work at a tech retailer  We sell tech and tech accessories  and we also facilitate tech repairs  One day an elderly woman came into our store with a new phone  She said that when she answered the phone  people sounded really far away  and when she put them on speaker phone  it fixed the issue  This isn’t out of the ordinary  as manufacturing warranties are a thing and different parts of the phone are used for different functions  meaning one speaker could be malfunctioning while another speaker is fine  I decided to run a quick test for the phone’s audio  and it passed everything  I then decided to grab a store phone and test the issue with her in the store  I called her phone and she answered  leaving the phone on the testing bench  I waited for her to pick up the phone to talk to me  and she     MOTIONED FOR ME TO START SPEAKING   I spoke while in a state of pure confusion  She then put me on speaker phone  and said “see  that’s much better ” I asked her to put the phone up to her ear  and WOWZA  that fixed the issue  I then spent  minutes explaining how phones work  This was not her first phone either  so I have no idea why she never learned to put the phone up to her ear  as that’s how phones have worked since their inception,1435,272

391,l0yn4q,1,28,Customer strongly disliked the couple standing behind her in line  Happened around late summer of   Store was packed thanks to a mix of back to school shopping and the fall decorations that just came in  All lines at the registers were crazy long and you can bet it was quite stressful  as by that point I had only been working there for a month and a half Just as Im finishing up with my current customer  a woman with an annoyed look all throughout her time in line  straight up butts in and tells me to please tell the customers behind her to keep away from her  I took a quick glance and saw a middle aged couple simply having a conversation with one another  Judging by their appearance and attire  they were from India  All they were doing was simply talking in their native language  and it somehow rubbed this annoyed lady the wrong way She just slams her money and stuff on the counter while glaring daggers at these people for no real reason  Once the transaction was done  she snatched the receipt from my hand  scratching me at the same time   turned back to the couple and loudly yelled  STAY AWAY FROM ME  JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME   and then stormed off  leaving the rest of us confused as hell Looking back  that was one of the earliest Karen encounters Ive witnessed  It became evident she was trying to start some sort of drama and hoped Id take her side or something  I dont know lol,1413,258

394,kyxg26,1,105,Red or Green  Im blind   My first on the books job was at a grocery store  One day we had a regular who was entirely blind  and I helped him shop  He was a good guy I liked working with him  but I screwed up a few times  We were in produce and he asked about grapes  so I asked  red or green  I immediately was mortified but still was not sure how else to describe them  He tried a few and selected one or the other  I forget which I got him  but I made sure he had the freshest grapes in the darn store     By check out I had been descriptive enough that he had too many products for his bag  Apparently  he normally loaded his groceries into a large hiking backpack and walked home  I had simply described too many things that he liked  So  he needed to borrow the cart to get his groceries home  Normally carts were not allowed out of the parking lot  I walked with this man all the way to his home a few blocks away  The final mistake… I asked him if he wanted me to turn his lights on for him  I guess it did not matter    To this day I really hope that he did not hate me and that I was a good help,1112,229
395,kybgrl,1,0,Cell phone Or Death  I worked for an electronics retailer that is now out of business  It was ‘R’ in a circle  We had a young man upgrade his cell phone  No biggie  Per policy and law  it was all within his rights and he used a debit card  Note here that we are not required to check IDs with use of debit cards  After all he at least needs the pin to continue  The next day the store got a call  I took it and this young man’s father screamed into the phone about the transaction  It was a good  minutes before I could figure out what it was about because he was so incomprehensible  I warned other employees that he was coming in the next day  Instead  he went to another of our locations and pulled the same screaming act  I heard through the grapevine  He showed up the next day at our location the next day  He did not want a refund  He did not want anything else from us  His son stood there with a crap eating grin  What did he want  My best instinct told me  he wanted a fight  My co workers informed me that he clearly carried a knife which was clearly visible in his pocket  My district manager  DM  forbids us from calling the police  Well  I should have known that my DM was full of BS  but I did what I could  As I was qualified by my state  I was legally able to conceal carry a firearm  Here’s where things get fun and thankfully not violent  I explain to my co worker the situation and what is in my bag under the counter  He gets excited and does what no responsible gun owner would do  He goes in my bag and pulls my firearm out… as a customer walks in… and promptly walks out for obvious reasons    After that  it was clear that I could not keep my firearm with me with such an irresponsible idiot in the store  I figured that instead I could have a broom handle  I was taking kenjutsu  at the time so it made sense to me  a Japanese sword art   Apparently  another co worker leaked to this guy why the broom handle was behind the counter and this same idiot was pretending that it was a sword swinging it around the store… several customers walked out because of this  We could not even have the broom handle out here with this idiot…  Then he does the big reveal  He lifts his shirt and reveals that he carries a Glock every day  As a lifelong shooter  this is the one guy of a thousand that I would not trust with a thimble  let alone a firearm    Note  I would dearly love to share all of screamers info  He was truly scum of the Erath  I kept that receipt with his address in my consul for a couple years until the Army took me  I still want to see him destroyed,2592,507
396,kyavv2,1,45,Retail to MMA This is my second Reddit post  My first ran afoul of the rules here so I deleted it   Please forgive me and let me know if I am violating any norms rules  I’ll figure it out In collage I worked at an electronics retailer known for a big R in a circle   One crazy evening a guy showed up demanding a refund on an item  He had everything  even his receipt  By all rights  a refund was no issue whatsoever but if that were all I would not be here  He demanded cash but he originally paid with card  I explained that policy required that the return be done according to the method originally used to pay and specifically the card that he used  He angerly claimed that card account was closed  I explained that my boss could override that  but she would not be in until the next day  This back and forth continued for several minutes as this guy got angrier and angrier  Now it is important to note  this guy is roughly ’ ” and easily north of  pounds  At this point he produces the card he used  showing that he lied  Whatever  We did the return and he left  This is where it gets crazy  It was  minutes past closing by this point and we are anxious to leave  It’s just myself and a co worker when we hear this guy screaming obscenities at the sky  My co worker makes what I would consider a mistake  He goes out in front of the store to see what is going on  Almost immediately these  enter the chicken walk that macho people do squaring up to fight  It is important to note here  although I did not know it at the time  that my co worker was also an MMA fighter  The guy did that dumb bum tackle where he hunches over and charges my co worker who immediately puts the guy into a guillotine head lock  My co worker handles the guy like a cattleman might handle an ornery calf  There were no blows buy my co worker dominated while this guys wife came screaming out of his truck  I realized at some point in this that I was of no help  I wrote the license plate of the guy on my palm with a sharpie and called the cops  This is where is got scary  My co worker released the guy figuring that he was done  The guy lumbered back to his truck like a brain dead pachyderm  We thought he was trying to leave but he immediately returned and ‘stabbed’ my co worker with something he picked up from his truck  Whatever it was  it apparently was not a knife  After that  the guy and his wife take off  The cops arrive a few minutes later  They plugged his license plate number into their on board computer and the guy’s mug shot pops up on their screen  From what I can see  he was previously wanted for drug related offenses  I can only figure that he was high and thought that the object he grabbed was a knife  He certainly swung it like one  Because there was no actual injury  no charges were pressed  however  my co worker was arrested a few years later for running a human trafficking ring including torture of women  Did you see that coming  If the admins approve  I may add his name as it is public record and in the news  He will never leave prison     Retail is crazy,3103,588
397,kwyxky,1,31,Customer still thinks the battery is missing after I turn the dust buster on  Short story here  but it blew my mind today I work the customer service desk and one of my first customers today brought a Stanley dust buster to return  He said someone one must have opened it and stolen the  rechargeable  battery out of the box before he bought it  because it wasnt in there I opened the box  looked at the dust buster and the wall mount charger  and realized it looked like the battery was an internal battery  I told the customer   I think its an internal battery   and started searching the box for something saying as much  He wasnt being rude when he said this  but he said to me   I dont care what youre looking for  I just want to return it   I said   Alright  whatever you say  sir  As soon as I was done with the return  he said   If you find the battery  Ill buy it back   So I picked the thing up and pushed the power button  Sure enough  the little motor started and the dust buster turned on  I turned it off and said   The battery is internal  sir   He said   No  the battery isnt here   I turned it on and left it on  holding it up in plain sight  I said   Sir  its running   as he insisted the battery is still missing and was looking around as if he was going to find it on the desk  Myself  my associate next to me  and the customer she was taking care of were trying so hard not to laugh The guy eventually realized what was happening and bought it back  He had a good laugh at himself about it,1527,288
398,kwkzqf,1,12,Off Duty Cop Threatens Me  Ok so Im still at ShopRite and this incident happened like a month ago  now like most of the stories Im sending in today  I dont exactly remember what the guy was wearing but I do know his wife was wearing a sports shirt  football or basketball  I dont exactly remember  Anyway  the guy comes and I start his order  I then notice a can of tuna on the side of the belt and I asked the guy if thats his and if its apart of the order  He then yells at me that yes its his but its apart of another order  I then respond with an ok  We continue  I then notice that he took one of our empty bags and throw it in his cart   Side note  I can be a bit obsessive about the stores bags cause customers constantly throw out bags on the floor  throw them onto the counter and leave them there  throw them in their cart expecting to use it for trash at home and my coworkers constantly crimple up bags and throw them under the register or into the back of the rack or next to the box of bags under the register and I constantly have to clean them up because the store doesnt like bags going unused  Now back to the story  I ask the guy if hed like me to use the bag for his bread  he then rips it out of the cart and jams the bread in  I let it go  We then move on to the end and I look up at the guy  He then proceeds to ask me if Ive got a problem with him  I then tell him no  why  He then tells me that I seem to have an attitude towards him and I ask him what he means  He then tells me that I made a big deal because he didnt put the bread in the bag that I wanted and Ive been very rude to him  I then call a manager over  but instead one of our runners showed up and I asked her if she could get me one of the managers  She then told me that the only manager on duty was on break and I would have to wait  She then asked the customer what the problem was and he told her the same story he was telling me  I then proceed to interrupt and make it clear that he was the one that started the fight over a can of tuna that I was asking about and that he seems to have his own problem with me  The guy then asks me if I would act this way towards him outside of work and I said no  Why do you ask  He then tells me that hes a cop and he knows that I wouldnt act this way if I was outside the store right now  I then tell him that he did technically threaten to take me outside  He then tells me that its not a threat and he should know because hes a cop  The runner then tells me to stop and calm down and just finish the order and leaves  By then his wife shows up and asks what happened  The cop then proceeds to tell her the same lie and I corrected him  She then comments that the can was on another order and I said ok  Now at this point the cop knew that he had screwed up and proceed to apologize and claim that maybe he was just having a bad night or something  I then accepted his apology and he asks his wife if he can go sit outside  after getting confirmation he leaves and I completed his wifes order while answering her questions about the incident  and order ended  Now after this incident I havent seen the cop again and I hope I never do,3189,662

402,ksnxt9,1,87,Customer mad that he got something for free For context  I work at a grocery store where  when a customer uses their rewards card  every  rewards points equals either    off a gallon of gas at our companys gas pumps  or    off of a purchase  Most customers prefer the gas money since gas prices are expensive where I live  but occasionally Ill find a customer whos willing to go through all the tedious steps of turning their rewards points into a grocery discount  When the discount is transferred onto their card  it automatically comes off the next time the customer uses their card on a purchase Anyway  time for the story An older man  probably in his s  comes through my lane the day after Christmas  Hes pleasant  albeit a bit unenthusiastic  Whatever  its  pm  right after a major holiday  He probably just wants to go home  All hes buying is a sandwich from our in store deli  I go through the whole  Hi  how are you today   script as per usual as I ring up the sandwich  which is     I ask him if he has a rewards card he would like to use  He does  and I scan it  Then  I hit total I stare in confusion at my computer screen  I have dyscalculia  like dyslexia but with numbers   so at first I think Im just reading all the numbers wrong  But no  the computer definitely says     and there is a little message on the item list on my screen that says  GROCERY DISCOUNT       so I know Im not hallucinating  I smile pleasantly at my customer and say   You lucky duck  You had some grocery dollars on your card  and youre getting this for free  I thought hed be pleasantly surprised   its a Christmas miracle  He doesnt have to pay for his sandwich  But no  Instead  he frowns  I dont remember exactly what he said here but he was very unhappy his discount had come off of this purchase   Take off the discount   he tells me I blink   What   I ask him  trying to retain my customer service voice  I wanted to use my    discount on my grocery order next week  I dont want a discount on this  I want to pay for it  Hes getting belligerent  and Im getting nervous   I cant take the discount off  sir   I tell him  trying to stay pleasant   theres no option on my computer for that  Its automatic   Well  how do I get my    back on my card  then   Well  I can void this whole transaction and start over  and you dont have to scan your card this time  I just have to get my manager over to authorize   I dont want to wait  I think fast  I have a lot of options here  but none of them will make him happy  I decide Ill just shove him off on the people at the customer service desk  Theyd be able to help him a lot better than I would anyway   Here  Ill just go through with this transaction  then you can take your receipt over to customer service  pay for your item there  and get the discount put back onto your card  I finish the transaction  he doesnt thank me or say good bye  and I continue on with my evening  I still dont know if he ever got his discount put back on his card  nor do I know if he ever realized that the    he got discounted off of that sandwich was the exact same    he would have not had to spend on a future grocery order  Its the same amount of money  sir,3269,601
403,ks925r,1,52,I WANT MY MONEY BACK    This was over  years ago when my state had just started the lottery  Everyone had gotten excited about winning ‘easy’ money and we’re going practically crazy buying lottery tickets and scratch offs  I had walked into a gas station store where I used to work and talk a friend who still worked there  It was around pm and we were talking about all the insane stuff some of the customers would do when an older Asian lady walked in going straight to the counter  LFor the employee I’ll call him Brian  elderly Asian lady will be AL  and since I was observing  I’ll just tell the story as it happened  Brian  “Yes ma’am  may I help you ”AL   In broken English  “How much scratch off ticket ”Brian  “  each  ma’am ”AL  “I want  please ” She picked the card style she wanted and paid for them in cash  Brian counted out  twice to be sure in front of her  Brian  “Anything else ”AL  “No  thank you ” and she got her tickets and went to her car  Brian and I were watching her scratch the tickets  in her car and were talking about how it’d be funny if she won a large jackpot and wanted her money now  After roughly  minutes  AL came back inside with her tickets and walked up to the counter  AL  “I want my money back    ” and she slammed the now used tickets on the counter  “These no good    I want my money back   ”Brian looked at me  then to AL and had a surprised look on his face  “Uh  ma’am  I can’t  Once you buy them they’re yours  You can’t bring them back for a refund  They’re yours forever and ever ”AL gave Brian a look that could kill a bear in it’s tracks  then at me  We really expected her to loudly complain  but she just quietly walked out to her car  Brian and I were examining the tickets and found she had won money  but probably didn’t notice it or understand how they worked  As she started backing up  I ran outside to inform her she had money coming and to come back in for her winnings  She almost ran me over before stopping  After I told AL she had won some money after all  she got excited  got out of her car  and ran back inside  Meanwhile I put the car in park  Yep  she was that excited  Brian explained how the scratch offs worked and showed AL the money she won  It really wasn’t much of a win  though  She paid   and walked away with    It didn’t matter  She strutted out the door as though she won a million dollars  After that I left for home and never saw Brian or AL again  I like to think that maybe AL might’ve gotten the golden ticket later on  just like Charlie and the chocolate factory,2603,486

411,klrtvk,1,138,That time a guy wanted a printer for free because it had no price tag I used to work as a cashier at an electronics store a few years back and for some reason this interaction popped into my mind so I figured you all might enjoy it  Now just for reference our store on weekends basically was a skeleton crew of   people so often times I had to deal with customer questions until one of the tech guys or my manager was free  This middle aged man comes up to cash with this printer and tells me it has no price tag on the shelf  So I apologize and tell him I can scan it to check for him  He then makes everyones favorite jokes about how  It has no price tag so its free   I give him my customer service laugh and let him know that its about   Then he tells me that its actually free because there is no price tag and I explain to him that it doesnt actually work like that  He tells me that because we would change the price if it had the wrong price tag that it having no price tag is equivalent to it having a price tag of   which means that we need to honor our policy and give it to him for free  So again I tell him no I cant give him a printer for free and instead offer him a coupon for   off that I had  Then he starts calling me an airhead or something like that and repeats everything but in a much slower and louder tone like Im dense So I call my manager who is busy with a customer  After a few minutes my manager comes and more or less explains the same thing that I had just said  The customer looks shocked  tells us hes going to go to the police  calls me some degrading name and storms off while shouting that hell never shop here again  The following weekend I cashed him out and would continue to see him in the store for the next few years I worked there,1796,360
412,kilxxz,1,20,Old Air Force Vets can be cool  Some background before we begin  I am a huge car enthusiast whose very proud of my family heritage  mainly French and Italian  and have been to Europe a few times to be familiar with the cars there  That said  lets begin Its about ish  and Im at work at my local outlet mall working at a higher end audio brand  Its a mall that sees a TON of both local and international traffic  as there is an international airport about  miles away with busses that run direct to it from the airport   kinda legit when you think about it  We just started selling a brand new Bluetooth speaker that had plenty of hype behind it and was becoming quite popular as we were entering the summer months because of its loudness and outdoor usability  Enter Air Force Vet  now called AFV Me  Hi  welcome to the XXXX store  how can i help you AFV  well    I have an odd request  Me  What do you need   heard this line before  or so i thought AFV  Well    i need to take a product outside  you have a floor model i can take  Me  mildly startled  What do you mean outside  Our products cant leave our sales floor This gets the attention of my Store Manager  who now has his head turned to listen in on the conversationAFV  Well  i need to see if something fits    its a tight space   Mind you  this gentleman is older  maybe mid s into early s  From his demeanor  i could tell that even he knew this was highly irregular to ask to take a product out of the store floor without purchasing  but I could also tell he was an honest sort of guy  SM  store manager    walking over  what are you trying to do sir  AFV  I heard about this new speaker of yours and wanted to see if it fit in a space in my car  it doesnt have a stereo  and this speaker looks like it could fit perfectly in this space  Now my manager knows my affinity for cars  so when i looked at him knowingly and longingly  he gave the approval to go outside with the product and was basically told to guard the unit with my life  As we walked out to the guys car  we started talking back and forth  Turns out  he is an AFV from serving for nearly yrs at airbases in Germany and Italy  He served during the s s and lived there for a small while with his wife in Italy  They returned only recently and decided to bring his beloved car back from Italy with him  The Car  A beautiful all original s Fiat  in a glorious  tone red on black  It had been refitted with a power outlet to run a small fan  car was never built with AC or anything powered  with the original leather top as the only other source of fresh air  And it was tiny After discussing the car  we promptly looked in the center  Low and behold  the  space  was a near exact fit  with a power outlet to charge the speaker with right there  Car never had a radio in it to begin with  so this would be a huge upgrade over the deafening sound of tiny Italian engine noises  We give it a test right there in the lot in the car  AFV was relatively satisfied  but after all the excitement over seeing and being in this car  I wanted to seal the sale  I convinced him to start the car   at this point we were pretty chummy  so we could test the speaker with the native car sounds and see if the speaker could outdo the noise  Then  HE gets really committed   buckle in  lets go for a ride Without question  I buckled in  Next thing I know  we are now scooting around the massive parking lot of my outlet mall doing nearly  mph  the top speed of the Fiat  blasting the Eagles at full volume without any issues hearing the music  Im having a blast  loving every second of not only chilling with this incredibly nice gentleman  but also getting PAID to be in this car with AFV  About  minutes of racecar noises and reciepts later  he bought not only the speaker  but every optional item we had for it  minus a car charger since he had the power outlet already in his car  Easily the coolest day at work EVER  and one of the best customers I ever had,4049,760
413,kiegm0,1,29,That difficult customer I am new to the retail world of the department stores and I was at a register currently ringing another customer for their items  During that transition  two ladies with a stroller were browsing some items on a display and tried to ask for the price of the items while I was ringing my current customer for their items  I asked them if they could wait until I finished with the transaction before I could give them an answer  They showed facial expressions that were certainly displeased and even someone like me who has high function autism  I have a hard time recognizing facial  vocal tone  or body language expressions of peoples feelings or mood  could recognize instantly they were going to be troublesome  After I was finished with my customer  the two ladies came up to ask me to help them with a return  Unfortunately  the item in question had multiple return labels which made the transaction to return their item difficult and caused errors in the system  Looking at their item  I noticed it for another brand that has their own section in the store and asked them to visit their counter to get their item properly taken care of as I wasnt able to continue the transaction  The customer got much angrier as they did not want to wait in another line to get a return  but I told them I am unable to do the return as it was a brand item for a specific section  Both ladies got very angry yelling profanities and one of the ladies said she once worked for the company and knows how we do things and that I was incompetent and lazy and I should do my job  I almost lost my temper  but I firmly told her I couldnt help her as it was not part of my area in the department  Also I was a new hire for a month so I am limited in knowledge and training being thrown into the holiday seasonal hire   She demanded my manager which I tried but being in an area of the store where cell reception doesnt work I couldnt make a call to my manager  I was also too far from other employees to get help  During this time she and her companion were yelling additional profanities and name calling while waiting At that point  I was starting to get more worked up and just trying to get them to go away  I attempted to walk away   I have the right to refuse service if I felt in danger  as they kept bombarding me with insults  but they positioned themselves in a way where every direction I went they went to stand in front of me  Finally  another employee who was more knowledgeable than me happen to pass by and the womans attention turned to grab that other employee who could possibly do better than me an incompetent employee  I was trembling due to an anxiety attack coming up and the lady and her friend continued to make fun of me trembling and additional insults as my fellow coworker was problem shooting the issue  Apparently  it was a situation that needs to be overridden by a full time employee or manager  I found an opportunity to leave and politely excuse myself before going to the staff breakroom to breakdown  For an experience that lasted about  minutes  it left a deep impression on me and I still get worked up from it  How can someone who says they worked in retail  goes back as a customer and treat a retail worker like that  I am still wanting to be as helpful as I can be in retail  and take this experience as a harsh learning experience,3398,626

416,kdf1wf,1,16,Why are you doing your job while we shop  Dont know if this belongs here  If not delete it  So I work at a retail store as a maintenance worker and everyday were supposed to do a routine sweep of the store  Basically we take a big dust broom and go down the aisles picking up debris One day doing said job I came across not one but two Karens  Anyway the story goes as follows  Cast is  M  is me K  is Karen OK  is other Karen I was going down the aisles and went down the clearance aisle and low and behold there they were  Kids beside them K  Why are you doing that while people are shopping M  Sorry  I go about my job and dont even push my way past them but walk past them  OK  you got dirt on my sons feet  M  Sorry OK  Rude I almost wanted to ask her how apologizing is rude but didnt  Youd think that was the only time I saw them right  Well no     The next time I see them I was up at the registers getting ready for break and see a couple with a baby  Im a sucker for little kids and babies  I am standing there talking to them and who should be right behind me but the Karens K  Stop playing with that baby and move  I almost wanted to say  Oh so whos being rude now,1207,235
417,kd8fqh,1,109,Carts cant go on the escalator  So for some reason at the store I work at at least once a day a customer tries to take their cart up the escalator  Last week an elderly lady tried this and fell and broke her arm and cut her head open  We have signs posted at the top and bottom asking people not to do this but still every day you see someone taking their cart and having this surprised look on their face when they almost fall or their cart almost tips over  WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN  Maybe Im being judgemental or overestimating what people should know I feel like it should be common sense that taking a cart up an escalator might not have a good outcome  Another thing is they get angry when you tell them their not allowed to  Weve had customers call to file a complaint saying an employee told them they couldnt take their cart up on the escalator  Theyll be like they were rude about it  I understand no one wants to be talked to in a rude way but if an employee raises their voice or seems rude in a situation like that its because theyre trying to get your attention and express how dangerous what your doing is  Especially since weve had several incidents of people falling and then getting mad at us when theyre told we cant be held responsible because we have signs posted  Also this maybe unpopular but I dont think an employee should be required to smile and use their customer service voice when someone is doing something so reckless and not only endangering themselves but everyone else on the escalator as well  I just needed to get this off my chest because it is sooo frustrating to deal with on a daily basis,1647,307

420,k9xa7h,1,0,Do you take coupons  I was very early s working at a grocery store as a cashier   There were two guys  Id guess late s early s  I think they were roommates  who were regular customers but I rarely had them in my line   They would purposely pick lines with female cashiers and then try to flirt with them   I didnt understand their behavior until one Sunday morning they came through my line and asked the question  Do you take coupons   with the most smarmy of smiles   I naively replied  Of course  we take both  lt store gt  coupons and vendor coupons  and one of them hands me a stack of coupons   I look at the first one    off a specific coffee    Oh  you didnt buy this coffee so I cant take this coupon    next coupon   Oh  this is the same coupon as the first so I would have only been able to take one  if you had purchased that coffee   as I quickly go through the rest of their coupons only to determine that none of the coupons were for items they were buying   I looked at them confused as I handed the stack back to them and the really smarmy guy says  All the other cashiers take them   Cant you do us a favor and be a sweetie for us    Thats when I figured out the flirting that had been going on   What they didnt realize is that I know fake flirting when I see it and it wasnt going to work on me    Sorry  I should have explained that I can only take coupons for items that you are currently purchasing   Do you have any of those  Shockingly  they never came through my line again,1525,299

423,k6n62t,1,197,But I need formula for my baby  Are you sure  Ive work in a supermarket for  years  You get your share of Karens and the only thing you can do is smile politely But what I even hated more after an  hour shift and having to close up the supermarket were the customers who came in   minutes before closing and just do their shopping like no one wants to go home There was a time that I was scheduled every Friday closing shift and pretty much every Saturday closing shift  The store closed at   We werent open on Sundays then  Also on Saturday we had to take out all the cash drawers and   manually  count all the money   We could start doing this when all the customers had left and the front and back doors were locked So customers coming in  to  minutes before closing time and taking their sweet sweet time to shop were hated  Hated with a passion My shop had a procedure  We would barricade our entrance and turn our front door on only opening when people wanted to leave the store at about  minutes before closing  We would remind customers at a quarter to   to and  to closing time that the store was going to close and please go and pay for their groceries Normally we had very few incidents This one   however  is burned in my memory C   colleague  FM  formula man It was a Saturday  As head of the cashiers for that night I had the honour to make or break the day of our beloved customers  I had to deal with my fair share of Karens  male and female  and I just wanted to go home So I follow the procedure  ask one of my fellow money handlers to set the front door and stay there to handle any customer At  minutes before closing time a man comes running to the door  My colleague asks what he needs and  reminds him that the store is going to close and he wont have much time  He says he just needs formula Since I was busy with a customer she let him in Guy gets a basket and goes into the shop  Since he said he needed formula we thought he would be in an out like Road runner  Nope No  because FM didnt need formula  At   FM is seen at the cheese section if our store    at our wine section  What the heck does he need that for Several of my colleagues have gone to this man to get him to the counter  He scoffs  huffs and says that hes a paying customer  My fellow money handler was the last one to go to him and thats when he went too far  He yelled at her  cussing at her and making a high school student cry  Now Im pissed  So I do what I always do in these situations  I take if my store shirt  put out a neat jacket I keep in case of emergencies and put it on  You see  when you have the store outfit on  you are often seen as a lesser being  But behold  I change my outfit and suddenly I look like management and my word is all powerful  The real manager sees this happening  pops out a huge grin and goes to the back and watch from the security cameras So I don the magical outfit and go to FM   I tell him in no uncertain  terms that the store has been closed for  minutes and he has been asked multiple times to go and pay for his things  He starts to huff and puff himself up like the big bad wolf   Im  woman and people think they can intimidate me   I told him that he was only allowed entrance since he said he needed formula  So I gave him a choice  He could go now and pay for the things in his basket or I would take the basked from him  grab rhe formula he claimed to need so much and he could pay for that He could choose not to do either  and in that case security would love to make his acquaintance  Either way  he would leave now He tried  oh boy he tried to threaten and intimate me He failed  He left   with his cheese and wine  And many threats to call corporate The best week he came again  This time he encounters me at the door  What did he need  Formula So I brought him to our service desk  went inside and brought out a single pack of every kind of formula we had  Asked him which one he needed He didnt say a word and left  Dont mess with our closing times,4083,792
424,k6fbde,1,38,Customer had a huge shouting match with a co worker over    Hailing once again from the arts and crafts store I used to work at  this event happened on one of the slower days in early spring of   It was just me and a co worker up front  I was a cashier and they were the front end supervisor  FES for short  of my shift  In comes a customer with a large bag of electric candles she wanted to return  No problem  If the items still functioned  that meant a full refund  so we tested each candle  Only one of them didnt turn on even with new batteries  FES made sure to mention that that candle in particular wouldnt be returned  and as she headed out back to get some more change for my register  the customers mood soured almost immediately This woman angrily mutters  who does this  year old think she is    She was referring to the FES  who at the time was   Keep in mind these candles are worth just    each and this woman got furious  When the FES returned with the change  customer demanded shed get the full refund for the broken candle regardless  and immediately began to shout every insult she could at her  FES did not hesitate to snap right back while still keeping a big smile on her face  but you knew she was furious by just how red her face was  I was watching on in silent disbelief at how sudden this entire thing escalated Customer got even louder and angrier  to the point surrounding customers immediately noticed  Some went as far as defending us while bashing this crazy woman for her unnecessary and extremely rude behavior  Customer simply shouted angrily at them as well  and it got to the point the manager and assistant managers went to the front to see what was going on  The shouting could be heard throughout the entire store  Crazy lady tried to make it seem like both myself and the FES were in the wrong  I stayed quiet throughout this massive shouting match yet I was somehow to blame as well  Karen logic  When the lady realized no one was taking her side  she stormed off  leaving the candles behind without the return being completed  all while threatening to sue  She never came back,2146,388
425,k6e4c0,1,17,Self admittance to being a scalping piece of shit This happened today  So I had a customer come in asking me to help her out with her internet modem and set her up with a new modem or send out a technician to help her out  No problem  I ask her how her day went and if she did anything for Black Friday  She tells me she got a PS for her kid  Here’s where I may have fucked up  I asked her “oh where did you get it from ”Her response  “oh I didn’t get just one  I got five ” She explained to me that A few different Fred Meyers in our area had each restocked for in store purchases only for Black Friday Saturday She immediately saw my eyes wide open and she just kept flexing on me that she got five and started rubbing it in  I almost cancelled her entire transaction because I thought to myself  you scalping piece of shit  But then I realized  I have to be professional and I’m making money off this transaction so I kept my cool  finished the transaction and immediately started calling the places she said were restocked  for Black Friday  and basically left before we could finish speaking Moral of the story  fuck scalpers,1154,212
426,k6cewi,1,2,Customer calls about our deals  then asks about how were handling COVID and then says we deserve to be shut down  I hope this belongs here  I work in a restaurant and I am posting this on behalf of my manager  with permission of course  who got a call this morning twice from this woman For reference  I work at a popular wing restaurant  We dont open until am and per our state gov  we are to always close at pm  Ill tell this from my managers POV as well I got a call this morning from a woman at around am who was asking a lot of questions about our menu and our deals for today  and then asked how we were handling social distancing and safety precautions and sanitizing  etc  She ends on her last question and seems satisfied with her answers  we hang up and I think thats the end of it  Not even ten minutes later the same woman calls back and says that we are not handling the pandemic correctly at all  then proceeds to tell me we should be shut down permanently and that we are stealing all of the business from small shops around town and that our corporation is evil  I explain to her that I am running the store as I am told  and I offer her the number to corporate because she seems genuinely concerned by this and it is in fact her right to make a complaint  She continues to interrupt  I ask her if she has been in our restaurant and if something has happened  She told me she has never step foot in our restaurant and never will  again  still refusing the number to corporate and continuing to insist that I am evil and I am the sole reason small businesses around the world struggle  Eventually I get tired of he ranting and I tell her without allowing her to interrupt again that I am running the store per corporate  that I have no say in how we run our business and am not allowed to close the store  I inform her again that she can have the corporate number and give it to her  tell her to make a report  I apologize and said that I hope this pandemic ends soon so that you wont feel the need to call and harass businesses anymore since you feel so strongly about how we practice our business  have a nice day and hung up She never called back,2181,417
427,k5kpqi,1,19,Will this break   I was working in an area that sold dining ware  We had different types of ceramic  including Stoneware  which may have been made of ground rocks     long time ago  and was more dense and less elegant than most of our ceramics  This guy picks up a stoneware dinner plate in his hand and is kind of weighing it  He asks   Will this break  Me   Yes  even though it feels solid  its still ceramic  Guy   It doesnt feel like it would break  Me   I mean  anything will break if you drop it  Guy   I bet it wouldnt break if I dropped it here    Onto our wood floor  Me   I assure you  it will break if you drop it  This man looks me straight in the eye  stretches his arm out in front of him  and lets go of the plate  It hits the ground exactly parallel to the floor  creating some kind of vacuum effect that made everyones ears pop  and the pieces went flying further than I have ever seen This adult man  dressed like hes on his way home from the office  just looks so surprised that he made a massive noise and exploded ceramic all over the store  and dented the floor  He was then really apologetic and insisted on paying for the plate  Though we would normally never ask for money for customer damage  I let him pay  We cleaned up immediately  but we were still finding bits of that plate in odd corners of the store for weeks afterward,1378,248
428,k5j7xh,1,0,Customers that stare So I work in a smoke shop  dealing with quite a variety of people  Most customers are surprisingly nice but I do get the occasional Karen or Ken  But I can deal with them easily  my problem lies in my anxiety that I’ve suffered from since middle school  This job has helped me face my anxiety and get better at managing it  But stares still get me hard  and I don’t mind if you’re staring at me across the room waiting for me to help you  My anxiety spikes when I’m cashing you out and you’re inches away as I handle the transaction staring me dead in the eyes  Like I can feel your gaze burning into my soul  it makes me extremely uncomfortable  There’s so much to look at around you and most customers do look around as I handle everything  But some just stand in pure silence  barely responding to my small talk and stare  I’ve gotten the most mean and judgmental stares from older middle aged women  I just look up for a second and see mean eyes staring right at me  I’m really quick at counting money and using my ancient register  I can’t scan items so I need to remember all of the prices  insert the tax for all the items being purchased  It takes just a minute and I feel like these customers are upset I take an extra few seconds to cash them out then what they are used too  Most just stare at my hands watching me push dozens of buttons in a quick fashion  but some people just need to look right into my face making me lose focus on my complex register  Anyone else experience this kind of thing  Do you get used too it,1560,298
429,k5iw3o,1,17,Though this happened years ago  this still sticks with me  I’ve worked at a grocery store for over five years now  This story happened within my first year  I think    but it’s by far one of the kindest things that’s ever happened to me I found out my childhood best friend committed suicide  and I was devastated  I was heading back inside from loading a customer’s groceries in their car  I was visibly sad  and a man noticed  He asked me what’s going on  I explained to him what happened  He then takes my hand and he prayed for me  When he finished  I thanked him When I got inside  I burst into tears  I got so emotional  I had to go home  That man was by far one of the kindest I’ve ever met at my work  That day will live with me forever,749,143
430,k4xt8y,1,85,Grandma’s Ripe Avocados  Not as interesting as some of the stories I’ve read here  but it was memorable at least  It was my first week working at a big  widely known grocery store and my department was online grocery pickup  Because it was my first week  I was scheduled to be doing a little bit of everything so I could be trained in every area of the job  Helping with online orders that weren’t grocery  picking the grocery orders  and doing the actual job of taking the groceries outside to customers  On this day in particular  it was only my first or second time actually picking out groceries without the person who was training me  I was minding my business in the produce section  trying to remember all the info crammed into my head over the span of a day and a half  when someone right next to me half shouts  “Do you  work here  ” I look over  scanner in one hand and produce bag in the other  and Cranky Grandma is staring me down  “Yes  can I help you find something ” She holds up her opaque produce bag and gestures wildly to the avocado shelf near us  “ Are these ripe  ” I stare at her and try to comprehend what in the fresh hell is being asked of me  I’m not an avocado farmer  I don’t even like avocados    all of those avocados could be expired for all I know  I answer truthfully  “I’m new so I’m not actually sure  but I’ll be happy to find that answer for you ” She stares at me and goes  “I just want to know if they’re ripe ” I stare back for a moment and look around uncertainly until I catch the eye of my coworker who seems to have heard what’s going on  She comes over to help  “Is there something you need help with  ma’am ” Cranky Grandma turns to her and shakes her opaque bag of avocados once more  “I just need to know if these are ripe ” My coworker begins to answer but before she can even get a full sentence going  Cranky Grandma turns to the shelf of avocados and promptly dumps out her produce bag  She turns to my coworker again  “Where are your  fresh  walnuts  Not bagged   fresh  ” At that point  I turn and go anywhere but there so I can let out my laughter in peace  I eventually learned to deal with difficult customers  but truly didn’t realize how crazy people really were until my entire half a year at that awful job,2308,426
431,k4o4iy,1,1,Customers are always right even when its against store policy apparently During my time working at an arts and crafts store  the store went through  managers  This manager in question was    and thats what well refer to her as    had this very sweet persona and a big smile all the time  but she was the manager that always gave customers what they wanted even though it was against company policy  This included allowing customers to use multiple coupons when it was always just one  per person  per day It goes without saying that its practically a universal retail experience to run into people that believe the rules simply dont apply to them for whatever their given reasons are  What makes it worse  at least in my opinion  is when managers approve of this sort of behavior by giving them what they want anyway  It makes the rest of us feel like theres no point in enforcing the rules when theyll just be broken anyway  and make us look like morons in front of the  usually  rude customers Recapping from my previous post  this was the same manager that approved the return of holiday items after the holiday had passed  which was against the companys policy  In another instance  she approved the return of clearance items  All clearance items at the store were labeled with price stickers of a different color and would show up as such when scanned  Customers were always informed of this at the time of purchase and it was also listed on their receipt  The only exception to this rule was if you were returning an item that wasnt clearance at the time you bought it  As long as they have the receipt to prove it  it could be returned no problem  If the customer was a rewards member  the transaction itself could be pulled up by their name and scanning the item in question    would still go ahead and approve a couple returns of those that already bought the items on clearance In what I feel is the most memorable instance  this habit of   got so bad she even allowed the return of an item that wasnt even sold by the store  but by a competitor arts and crafts store  Yes  you read that right  It was so baffling that even now it still gives me a chuckle,2191,394
432,k4mn6v,1,25,Why Even Have A Return Policy  Id like to preface this story by saying I generally like my boss  Hes a pretty chill guy  he backs me up on a lot of stuff and will step in to handle things if customers start getting mad  Unfortunately  he does have his moments of being spineless  This is one of them I work in an outdoor clothing shop  and our return policy explicitly states that clothing that has been washed is no longer eligible to be returned  Like  minutes before close one night  guy rolls into the store with a return  Being the doorman  I chat him up and ask what hes in for  and he says he washed this shirt and now its too small and he wants to return it  I tell him upfront that I dont think hell be allowed to  but he can go up to the counter and find out for himself  I radio ahead to let them know this one is gonna be a doozy My manager tells him he cant return it  Dude proceeds to throw a classic tantrum  like  what do you mean  it doesnt fit me  I dont wanna keep this  blah blah blah  and he proceeds to storm out yelling  You just lost a customer  over his shoulder  I start making fun of him with colleagues  as you do  and he storms back in to demand the regional managers name and number  Presumably so he can waste his time bitching about how we wont bend policy for a   shirt My managers spine suddenly vanishes and he decides to just give this dude what he wants to get him to go away  He looks up the dudes receipt    and then it hits him  The dude has been claiming this whole time he bought an XL shirt  and that after washing it doesnt fit  cant get his arms through the sleeves  My boss looks at the receipt  looks at the shirt  and realizes this dude bought a large  and tells him I wasnt there to personally witness this moment  but apparently the dude just absolutely deflated  All the wind went out of his sails in an instant  He was very quiet for the remainder of the exchange  as my manager proceeded to comp him an XL of the same shirt  I was not a fan of my boss in that moment  but the sheer thrill of learning this dude was this angry over the wrong thing kinda cancelled it out,2150,414
433,k4h4mn,1,182,Wrinkly ten dollar bill I got out of my retail job in October but I wanted to share my last insane customer story  It was a Wednesday afternoon in your average discount clothing  homegoods and doorknob store  I was ringing up a lady and her daughter  Her total came out to   and she hands me a    I go in my drawer and handed her a   from the top of the stack and close the register  I was working quickly because I had worked there for long enough that I could do that with little mistakes  and because we had a line building up  This lady looks at her bill and goes  excuse me can you give me a nice    And I inform her that unfortunately we are not allowed to open the drawer after it has been closed   Its fine  Ill wait  call the next customer and you can give it to me then  she says  I informed her again that I would not be able to open the drawer for her  She tells me to call the next customer  she can wait  So I look back at my manager who comes over  I explain the situation and she again informs the lady that I could not open the register  and I was not allowed to switch out bills on different transaction Im telling yall   its like we told her we killed her entire family with the machetes we sold  She starts screaming about how I gave her a  raggedy ass bill  and how it was going to rip and then what is she supposed to do  Shes not going to use it right away  She then yells  she took my nice twenty pretty damn fast  and it took all of my strength to not react because what the hell is she accusing me of After she left I had to take a couple of minutes to just stare out the window trying to process what the fuck just happened,1672,333
434,k4ekr6,1,2,Do you need to be let in  Serious question here  if the main doors to my store are locked  do I need to let a customer in  A few nights ago  me and another coworker were closing and I had locked the door as it was already   minutes past our closing time  I had finished closing the register and coworker was putting things away in the back  all normal  Suddenly  a guy comes up to our locked door and just stands there  Our front lights were off aside from a small one by the register that was always on  so to most people it’s easy to tell we weren’t open anymore  He starts to knock and my coworker asks if we need to let him in  I told my coworker we don’t legally have too I think  After a while the guy leaves but this is where my question strikes  Did it need to let that guy in  I didn’t think I had too but now it’s got me thinking  If someone could tell me that would be great,889,180
435,k48qag,1,7,Out of Old Fashioned I work as a baker at a grocery store  covering just about all of the baked goods we sell  from bread  to muffins  to   donuts  We don’t always have every kind of donut  and some are more popular than others  so I try to give as much variety as I can and spice things up a little to compensate  That being said  as you all are probably aware  you can’t always please everyone After baking  I work on packaging bread near the counter of my station  opening myself up to the customers and making me vulnerable to questions  that of which I do not mind  Especially in the morning hours  people usually aren’t too keen on talking much  so interactions are pretty quick and painless  Today  however  our star of the show surely did bust out a performance At the sound of an “excuse me ”  I made my way over to help as soon as I could  However  before I could greet the customer  I was asked  “Do you have any of the plain donuts ” Well no  no we didn’t  Sadly  that’s one of the more popular ones  so we were still waiting to get that restocked  Not only that  but my manager had made a point to tell me that we were out of the old fashioned  so I apologized and broke the bad news He didn’t like this much He began explaining to me what an old fashioned donut looked like  and although I was completely aware already  I heard him out and apologized once again about the lack of that kind of donut in our stock  “Can you go check ” He would ask me  which would make me pause for a moment  Hypothetically speaking  if I did manage to find some old fashioned in stock  the man would find himself waiting there for up to an hour and a half waiting for me to proof them and fry them for him  and not only was I sure this man did not want to spend any more time there than he had to  but I didn’t want to take away space from the other bakers just for one tray of donuts that I was sure we didn’t have anyways I calmly informed him of my position and how I had been adamantly insisting on a restock  in which he replied by demanding for a manager  To be frank  my shift was  minutes away from being over at this point  so when I gleefully fled off to retrieve a manager  I didn’t bother returning to my station for any longer than I needed to clean it off  While I stood cleaning  I heard my manager tell the customer the same thing  in which the man proceeded to melt down about it in front of my manager  Night shifts can really tear at a woman’s soul  so I didn’t bother to witness the chaos that pursued after that  taking the long way through the back doors to the break room in a successful attempt to avoid another encounter  I saw my manager later on  too  so luckily  he survived as well,2724,519

437,k41o2x,1,21,Why Dont People Read the Signs  This happened last year in the final weeks before the store I worked for had to shut its doors for good  Two months before the day  we received all of our going out of business signs  The big  CLOSING  banner for the exterior  about a dozen signs to put around the store  super low discounts on all our remaining merchandise and whatnot  Though our store wasnt super popular  it was more of a word of mouth store since it didnt advertise on TV or radio   some of us were surprised to hear the store mentioned on the radio and some news reports in the months before we closed At this point  we had an increase of customers  new and regular alike  who wanted to get their hands on what they could before all the good stuff was gone  In this time  some employees jumped ship and either found new jobs or returned solely to their main jobs since this was a side job for them  It was sad to see them go  but it was for good reason  The manager hired on some seasonal employees to help fill the gaps and we sure needed it  especially with the holiday rush coming We put a sign on the front door in big lettering of the last day we would be open  One shift I had in the middle of the afternoon  a young woman  maybe  or so  came in to ask a manager if we were hiring  I was one of the managers in charge and politely told her we werent as our store was closing one months time  She seemed surprised and asked me she didnt know  I told her about the bold lettered sign on the front door and to look ANYWHERE in the store about the store closing discounts  There were even a big yellow and black signs behind the register counter I was standing at The young woman  I kid you not  actually said  Ohhhh   You know that kind of  ohhhh  someone says after you had to explain a joke that went clear over their head  I told her the few stores in the plaza I knew were still hiring for the holidays and wished her luck in her search I wish I was joking when I say this happened at least three more times during my shifts  A young woman walked in the store  sometimes with a resume at the ready  asking if we were hiring  As politely as my tedium could muster  I told them we were closing and that the sign on the front door CLEARLY says when were closing  By this time  it was maybe two weeks before Christmas  and even if we werent closing  most places  dont do hirings during the crunchiest of crunch times anyway  I still wished the ladies good luck on their job hunt  knowing full well job searching is a job in and of itself How    HOW do these people not see these enormous yellow  red and black store closing signs  HOW  I ASK YOU   I wouldnt hire them anyway because they clearly dont read  Understand that I respect and give mad kudos to anyone going out there trying to get that cheese  but COME  ON  Were CLOSING  FOREVER  Read the SIGNS  Theyre here  theyre there  theyre EVERYWHERE for a reason  You would get one or two paychecks at most if we hired you on THAT DAY  And as for TRAINING a new hire when were already slammed  Aint nobody got time fa dat   sigh,3122,583

440,k3paxy,1,16,Customer expected an apology after getting what she wanted Happened at the arts and crafts store I used to work at  The company had a policy that seasonal items such as Christmas decorations could not be returned after said holiday  Customers are told this at the time of purchase and its also listed on their receipt  Doesnt stop some folks from trying to make such returns anyway  One such event happened the week after Christmas two years ago  Lady wanted to return some wreaths  but wasnt having it when I explained the policy to her  Assistant Manager came over and explained this to her as well  Lady got pissed She began spouting some non existent law stating that such returns were allowed  and her attempts at finding it on her phone failed because again  such a law doesnt exist in our state at least  Lady still thinks shes in the right  In comes store manager  who after being told of the situation  went ahead and approved the return anyway even though it was against company policy  As is routine with returns  an extra receipt is printed for the customer to sign Not only did the lady feign ignorance by asking what she was supposed to do  it clearly had a big line for signatures   she went ahead and told both me and the Assistant Manager that there was something else we were supposed to be telling her  She was expecting us to apologize  I had been silent throughout that whole mess but I was fuming  Assistant Manager and I simply exchanged glances and he left to perform other tasks while I merely called for the next customer in line without even looking at this Karen  She got the hint and left without saying anything else,1656,292
441,k3mt54,1,8,No  there isn’t the size you want One of the things we sell in the store are shoes  and for certain shoes there aren’t a half size to begin with  Guy asks if there is a size EUR   for a certain shoe  I tell him that we don’t have that size  Guy asks  “Then how come other shoes have half sizes ” I explain to him that I’m not sure  since I’m obviously not the one who made the shoe  just that we don’t have it in the first place  He still persists  saying “How is that even possible  Did you even check  I didn’t see you check ”I brought him over to the counter  and key in the code for the shoe  Of course  that size doesn’t show up  Even after showing him  he says he can’t believe it and asks me to go in the stock room to check  I went in  and of course didn’t help him check because I’m checking for something that doesn’t even exist  I come out in a minute or two  and tell him there really isn’t that size Guy gets increasingly annoyed  asks me to check if other stores have that size  I kept explaining to him that there was never this size made for this certain shoe  and even if he were to go every other of the same store he wouldn’t be able to get it  I even offered him to try a  or  instead  but he just kept whining about how it wouldn’t fit and that he needed    Finally after several minutes of his whining  he called his wife  and told her I was being rude when walking out the store What would he have had wanted me to do  Make a custom shoe size for him and him only,1503,301

461,k1yq1b,1,555,I wanna hear all your experiences standing up to a customer  I try my hardest to not say anything back but sometimes it slips out  A few days ago a middle aged man climbed up one of the staff’s ladders to grab an item from the top shelf  We don’t allow customers to climb up on the ladders due to safety reasons  I saw him move the ladder as I thought he was just moving it out of the way so he could look at the other items  which he did  Then a minute later he climbed up the ladder to try and grab an item  I was in the middle of serving of a customer when I noticed  I quickly finished the customers transaction then I walked up to him and told him politely  “I’m sorry sir but I’m afraid customers aren’t allowed to climb up on the ladders”  He gets annoyed and says “you saw me move the ladder and didn’t say anything  now you want to say something ” I say to him  “I understand but I thought you were just moving the ladder out of your way to have a look at the items the ladder was blocking”  He then says to me condescendingly  “are you really arguing with me right now ”  Me  “no sir  I’m just trying to tell you that customers aren’t allowed to climb up on the ladders because of safety reasons and because the ladder also does have “staff only” marked on it”  Customer  “keep arguing with me and I’ll have your career ended”  I look at him blankly while him and his daughter carry on about how I shouldn’t be arguing with the customer  I went back to the checkout to serve a customer  His daughter waits in the line  She comes up  throws all her items at me with immense attitude  wouldn’t respond or look at me when I asked if she was paying with card or cash  I gave her receipt and she snatched it off me then says  “you’re lucky he didn’t complain”  I was already having a rough day because of Black Friday sales and whining customer after whining customer  I told her to go ahead and complain  She looks at me in surprise and paused for  seconds  She then asks for my name and last name  I gave her my first name  She then asked for my last name  me  “sorry I can’t give you that information”  Daughter  “no worries  I’ll just describe you to head office  blonde and brown hair  with a tattoo  I’ll be filing a complaint about you” me  “lovely  have a nice day”  She stormed out cussing and carrying on  I didn’t mean to respond but I honestly had just had enough that day  I want to hear your experiences responding back to difficult customers fellow retailers,2482,475

463,k17hda,1,22,My thoughts go out to anyone working retail over the next few days  I’ve been there  I remember working at a grocery store in the late ’s   It was the day before Thanksgiving The store was in an affluent area of town  full of yuppies  Most customers weren’t too bad  but per capita  it was “Ken and Karen” ville  The women were in ‘Yuppie Camouflage’  They wore beige tans  beige suits  beige makeup  and beige nails  This was several years before the ‘I want to speak to the manager’ haircut  but the attitude was there  So we’ve got high strung customers  during a high stress holiday period  doing last minute shopping before the feast with all the relatives  They were already on the verge of meltdown because most customers have multiple carts  and the last carton of that particular brand of whatever hard to find ingredient required for Great Aunt Lucy’s casserole is melting in someone else’s cart The store was packed and the front end of the store was gridlocked  The customers who weren’t ready to check out couldn’t maneuver very well because the checkout lines extended into the aisles I was a hapless clerk just trying to keep the customers from going ballistic while trying to check out their order  Beep   beep   beep  I had just completed an order and was getting ready to run the credit card  I hit the button to activate the reader  I swiped the card and it took a long time to process  Eventually it beeps and gives an error  I tried again  No dice  The customer was getting impatient  I paged a manager to do a manual override  and process the card manually  We still had one of the old fashioned credit card plates and a stack of the carbon blanks  specifically for emergencies like this  The manager processed the card  I finished ringing up the order and proceeded to the next  One of my coworkers paged the manager to process their card order  and then another and another  The credit card system had gone down The manager was running ragged back and forth between the registers trying to keep up with the orders  To try to placate the crowd they got some bag boys circulating through the crowd with cookies from the bakery  The front office manager was on the phone with the support staff at HQ trying to get the credit system back on line  After what felt like hours  the credit system finally came up  we got the customers checked out without too many riots  and I was finally able to punch out I don’t envy you this year  Stay safe  hold onto your sanity  and I hope you at least get a few hours off to enjoy Thanksgiving with your family,2587,453

478,jz0zdo,1,7,Customer abandoned their baby in the store  didnt come back for over  minutes I work at a shoe store in a mall and this happened in the summer of    The store is fairly big and has many isles   These isles are at about ft high so generally  people can see overtop of them   It is very common for people to come in with their children in strollers and leave them close by while they try on shoes or look around   This is why when there was an abandoned baby  now to be referred to as Kevin  in the store  the staff didnt think much of it   That is until we noticed that Kevin was in his stroller was all alone with no family around for an extended period of time   Kevin could not have been any older than  months  Im guessing that he was probably three months old   We instantly informed my manager that Kevin seemed to be abandoned   Thats when she started rolling it around the store asking if Kevin belonged to anyone   She then ran into a customer that just so happened to be an off duty officer who informed us that we should call mall security   He stuck around and started asking everyone on staff if they had noticed anything about Kevin or the family   After putting our stories together  we realized that one coworker had cashed out the family  unaware that they even had a child  and they had left without Kevin   We took Kevin to the back room until security came   Kevin was visibly upset  so with permission from the off duty officer  the manager picked Kevin up trying to calm him down   Thats when the family rushes in  visibly angry at my manager    Keep in mind Kevin had been left in the store for at least  minutes at this point    The mother rushes up to my manager  snatches Kevin out of her hands  and scolds her for holding her child   No apology or sign of remorse for leaving her child   It turns out that the family got all the way to the other end of the mall before realizing that their child was missing   At that point  the off duty officer informed the mother that if he was on duty he would have charged her  but he was not  so he left the store after telling them off   The situation was then handed over to mall security after that so I do not know what happened to the family after that   Sadly I assume they were let go with a warning by mall security because the police never showed up to question us   I cant believe that they left their baby  full home alone style  and had the audacity to lecture scold us for their negligence,2484,484
479,jyzck7,1,2,First day on the till and I got shouted at Sorry this is long  This happened around a year ago while working in a reasonably high end retail shop in the UK  I worked on a makeup counter as the manager  each counter had its own ‘island’ and ours was L shaped  A little further away from our counter  facing the shorter side of our L shape counter that we never use unless we have a makeover in  they sold nail polish  random things  and they had a till area for that  It wasn’t really close to us  So before I start  I had been here for  weeks  The store had a dumb policy that they don’t till train you until the third week so you’re not “overwhelmed ” even though I had worked in retail before  This was my first day I finally had a till number and was getting used to it  We only really sold items from our counters  One day I was doing our weekly paperwork that took hours and I was focused  I suddenly felt eyes on me and I looked up  and turned to the side of me and there’s a woman standing there angrily shaking some nail polish at me with her eyebrows raised  First of all Karen why are you stood in a makeover area where you’re hidden by mirrors and there’s no till  I told her to come around to where my till actually was  I was a little slow on the till  I’ll admit  But I was polite  I ask her if she has a store card  she slams it on the counter without speaking a word  Oooook Me  “ok and the total is £”She slams another card on the counter without a word again and I assume it’s a gift card  because you know  I just gave her the total  In the store you have to know how much is on the gift card for the till to accept it Me  “oh do you know how much is on here  It’s just we have to know before I can put it on the till” Her  “I think you’ll find that’s a STAFF DISCOUNT card ” In the rudest tone Me  “oh ok  sorry it’s my first day on the till  I’m not sure how to do that yet I’ll get someone to help”She’s glaring at me by this point  One of the assistant department managers was talking to another counter near me so I get her and she does it quickly for me and walks away again Me  “ok and then your new total is  gives total ” no response again  just glaring  I was getting pretty tired of her attitude so I just went silent assuming she wasn’t in the mood  Neither was I  I’d been doing non stop paperwork  I handed her the receipt and she walks awayI thought that would be the end of it  But nope  All of a sudden she turns back around and aggressively says  “you know what  Some MANNERS wouldn’t go amiss  a please or a thank you maybe instead of being RUDE ”Like no I’d been working for six days straight and was at the start of my  hour shift and I’d had enough alreadyMe  “    why would I thank you when I’m the one serving you “ before I could finishHer  “I’m going to speak to your manager ” And stomps over to the assistant department manager  Jokes on her because she’s not my manager After speaking to her she storms off out the store  the assistant DM tells me all she said was I need to learn manners and how to use a till  duh   and she didn’t believe a word of it anyway and told me to ignore customers like that  because it’s higher end they can apparently be a nightmare,3250,631
480,jyylkr,1,45,Nobody puts baby in the corner  Had a customer come in with some balloons  but no receipt  I informed him that without the receipt  wed have to charge him for inflation because we have no proof of purchase  He got mad and asked for the manager  When we get angry customers we usually have them stand off to the side to wait for management so I said   Go ahead and wait over in that corner by the piñatas   Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because he said   NO  Im going to wait RIGHT HERE   And I was just like okay       you do you man  Then when my manager came over he was like   She told me that you needed the receipt and I have to go stand in the corner  Dude   thats not what I meant and you know it  He was acting like I was treating him like a kindergartner in trouble,797,151
481,jyyemp,1,2,So you want to electrocute your customers dogs  I spent  years working in retail  The first  of these I spent working in the petcare sector  Its been about  years since then  so my memories and stories of this time are a little fuzzy  but there is one story that really sticks in my mind  and this is the story I now share with you all today  This story takes place at some point between  and   when I worked at a large pet superstore here in the UK  TLDR at end   On this particular day  I was working close to the front of the store  and a customer approached me  As I say  memories are fuzzy  so I will be paraphrasing here  but this is roughly how the conversation went   Customer  Hello  i was wondering if you sold those electric shock collars that stop dogs barking   Me  Im afraid those are illegal here in the UK sir due to animal cruelty laws  We have other  more humane options available though  such as collars that blast air or water if the dog barks  or ones that make noises   Customer  I see  I really need a lot of them though   Me  You have a lot of dogs that all need anti bark training   Customer  Well  I just opened a kennels in the country  and my closest neighbour half a mile down the road is complaining that the dogs are too loud   Me  So you were wanting to put electric shock collars on your customers dogs    Customer  Well I need to shut them up somehow   Me  Im not sure we have anything that would be suitable for that  Those dogs are in an unfamiliar environment  with their owners absent  surrounded by other stressed  barking dogs  Im not sure youre going to have much success getting them to be quieter    Him  Ok  thankyou  And with that  he left  leaving me perplexed  confused  and pretty angry that someone would thing its a good idea to put electric shock collars  illegal or not  onto dogs that were not their own  Thinking back  I should probably have tried to find out where this kennels was and perhaps reported them or something  but in the heat of the moment  and in the shock of what he said  I didnt really think about it at the time   TL DR   Guy opened a kennels in the countryside  and neighbours complained about the noise  so he wanted to put electric shock collars on his customers dogs to stop them barking,2315,436
482,jyrjmf,1,41,The customers not always right  I work at a pretty well known home improvement store and today  I was giving one of my coworkers her break from our garden center  Its usually pretty slow out there  so I have a lot of time to talk to customers and interact with them between transactions  This lady and her husband came up to me and asked about the marigolds we had on special  I believe it was  quart size pots for   or something around there   I pointed them out to her and she and her husband disappeared for a few minutes  Eventually  they came back and grabbed  of the gallon size pots and plopped them down on the register  I started scanning their items like normal and when I got to the marigolds  they rang up as    each  I informed her of this and she wasnt the slightest bit happy  My register even said they were the gallon size  which I told her and they werent the ones on special  and she tried to tell me I didnt know a quart from a gallon and I needed to tell someone to fix the advertisement sign  I wasnt about to start an argument with her  but I remembered the conversion of  quarts in a gallon and I wanted to tell her that and  kindly  of course  point out that there was no way in heck that  of the bigger pots could ever fit into  of the smaller ones  I finally got her the ones that were on special  but she was so mad at me  Another customer trying to haggle for a lower price averted,1427,278
483,jyq504,1,34,Hung up on rude customer today Definitely something Ive wanted to do several times before  but I really couldnt justify it until this particular call  The lady was speaking loudly  presumably very close to the mic  in a way that made every other word unintelligible  I eventually told her this and she tells me that it sounds like Im whispering  Thats possible  Im pretty soft spoken and the face coverings dont help I at least tried to speak up and make it easier for her to understand me  She made no similar effort  After that it was just personal attacks against me   Oh  youre just saying you understand me because you dont know what product Im describing   I didnt know what product she was describing  Theres thousands of items in the store  its very unlikely that I would  I was in the process of searching our database for something like it  I told her this  She continued to make disparaging remarks while I searched  If only she could comprehend how significantly her comments impaired my focus   Eventually  it became clear she had no more interest in what she originally called about  and the conversation was now just a means of satisfying her ego by belittling the inferior retail employee  When I heard her husband start swearing at me in the background  I hung up  It felt good  I usually bend over backwards  more than I should  for customers  but honestly  if you arent adult enough to resist petty personal insults and just be pleasant  I have no interest in helping you  Im sure my managers would back me up on this  Now  Im sure this story is pretty mild compared to what some have experienced  Some jobs I would imagine it happens quite often,1687,294
484,jyn1dt,1,1,Customers saying “I get it for cheaper somewhere else”  How do you deal with them  So I get these types of customers on a daily basis where they typically come in and ask about pricing  So a  year old guy comes in with his gf or something  and asks “do you guys sell any cigars”  I said “yes” and proceeded to recommend to him some brands where he blatantly ignored me  He then asked me “how much do you sell X cigar for “ Let’s call X a cigar brand   I proceeded to tell him    which was followed by him saying I get them for   from somewhere else  These type of people make me wanna go over the counter and just straight up smack em  I kept my cool and told him “we sell them based on how much we get them from our wholesaler”  Didn’t even say thank you  he turns around and just leaves  How do you deal with these types of customers,842,167
485,jyj6qw,1,13,Lady wants money back in something we never sold her I used to work in a small local department store in a rural town  We were not a chain  and literally had  people working there I’m working at the register and this older lady comes in a demands a refund on a dressing gown she bought for her husband I check for a price sticker and ask her for a receipt  No she must have thrown it out At this point I realise we don’t even stock this product so I have no idea where she bought it from but it was definitely not our store  I try explaining that    We don’t stock this product     We have never stocked this product  I even try to find an invoice for us ever buying it    The tag on the item is not even from our store    Even if it was  she doesn’t have a receipt so there is nothing I can do She starts getting frustrated and belittling me saying  well you obviously can’t do anything  you’re completely useless Ah yes  I apologise for my own sheer incompetence in not being able to give you money back for something we never sold you  She says she will never be back and we have lost a loyal customer of  years I mean  I’ve never seen her in the store before in my  years there so not a huge loss,1224,238
486,jyisat,1,13,I Got To Give A Free Bear  Im typing this on my break  because oh my word  it made my day  This is my second day in a seasonal job  and Im pretty sure it will be the best day on the job My store has a big scratch and win promotion going on  Every ticket wins and ranges from discounts to free items to a grand prize of a   shopping spree  One of these prizes is a like three foot bear  All day its been   offs  a few   cards  one free thing  whatever  Then  at the til on my watch  a middle aged couple scratches to win the giant bear    I was stoked  I was super happy  my client just got the bear  I happily pulled him off the shelf to give to the family  This couple said they felt bad about taking it  and instead they asked us to donate it  Maybe give it to a family that looked in need or had a lot of kids  We were touched by their generosity  My coworker and I almost cried  After an hour  we got a call from our boss who wanted to check in with us  We finally asked if we could donate the bear  and she said we could give it to someone  My coworker said that I could pick the family because it was my client who pulled the bear card  Not long after that  a young  looking couple walked by  One parent holding a sleeping toddler in his arms  I imagined this kid with the bear and my heart melted  I told my coworker I think I found the kid  She said go for it  not to ask her  The family was pretty close to the exit  so I booked it  caught up with them  and said  Excuse me  Excuse me  Hi  would you like a free teddy bear   The family was shocked  but said sure  As we walked back to the store  I explained what happened  They were shocked to see how big the bear was  but they looked really happy to be receiving this gift for their kid  Now Im on break and cant stop smiling  and I guarantee my mother will cry when I tell her this story when I get home,1887,382
487,jygmp3,1,109,No questions asked return policy     yikes My best friend and I were working customer service   returns one summer and a man walked in who had purchased a mattress topper  You know     like the foamy thing that goes over the top of the mattress  The bag had been ripped opened and you could visibly see hair on the thing so we knew it had been used  We had a no questions asked return or exchange policy as long as the item was returned with a receipt  The policy states an employee must open the package and inspect it to see if it can hit the shelves again or if it should be disposed of  and by disposed of it meant it would go to auction   clearance or donated to charity  I was the unfortunate one to have to open this bag  Upon pulling out the foamy the guy turned around as to not make eye contact with us while inspecting it  There were bed bugs crawling out the centre  a large amount of what smelled like ammonia possibly cat urine and fecal matter  I called my manager and explained what just happened and in minutes she was there to rush the refund through  I was pulled into the office and fired for discriminating against the stores return policy  I wasn’t trying to argue  I thought it was disgusting that people would even try get their money back and return something in that condition  So this is why I stopped shopping there and to this day i cringe and get itchy when I think of the fact that they just threw it into a donation bin and didn’t burn it,1477,280
488,jxt242,1,10,Dude  just because youre hot doesnt mean Ill bend the rules for you   Hello dere  This happened at my retail job two years ago  It started on a Charmin Basic weekday afternoon at the women’s clothing store I worked in and I was in a good mood  I didn’t cuss out my alarm clock  the weather was nice  promos were bringing in good business  and I was working with two of my favorite ladies  While processing shipment  I hear my coworker talking with someone at the register  She shortly after came up to me with a confused and pretty flustered look on her face  She was still in training as she only recently got this job at the time and going about a return without a receipt was one of the things she had yet to learn  No biggie  I was happy to handle it for her while she watched and learned  The manager was busy on a phone call and I had no problem stepping up when I could When I saw the man  likely early to mid forties  I understand why she was so flustered  This man  oh muh GAWD  GIRL  compliments to the chef  was gorgeous  Clean shaved  great skin  nicely pressed suit  news reporter white teeth  The textbook definition of tall  dark and handsome  The kind of man you don’t bring home to mama because she’d keep him for herself  My coworker stood by while I greeted the very pretty man with my usual retail smile  professional enough not to be intimidated by good looks Me  “Hello  sir  How can I help you ” Pretty Man    giving me a softcore Finn smolder   “Hello  lovely lady  How are you today ” Me    flattered but not fazed   “Doin’ good  thank you  Coworker tells me you have some returns ” Pretty Man  “I’m afraid so  I bought these for my mom a month ago  She shops here a lot  and everything I picked out she either didn’t like or didn’t fit  So  I’d like to return them and have the money refunded on my card please ” Me  “Alrighty  Do you have the receipt ” Pretty Man    sucks air through his teeth   About that…Me  “Ah okay  We can look up the purchase history if your mom is part of our free rewards program  Do you know her phone number ” Pretty Man  “   Do I need to do all that ” Me  “Yes  sir  It’s store policy ”He tells me his mom’s number  I type it in  and nothing comes up  He tries three other numbers that don’t work  I ask for her first and last name  email address  HOME address  husband’s name and number  HIS name and number  sometimes customers use family members’ names and numbers instead of their own for whatever reason   All of our regular customers were signed up for the rewards as they earn them through purchases and get coupons that were basically free money to use at the store Whenever the man looked to be getting impatient  he’d clear his throat and recompose himself whenever he saw me look at him  The whole time he’s feeding me empty flattery  asked where I got my hair done  I do it myself   compliments my makeup  asking how someone so young could be so professional  I was mid s at the time   just brown nosing me so much  he could take a crap by blowing his nose  The red flags waving in my head turned to red alarms with the unmistakable scent of bull crap radiating off him as he spoke  I don’t like people blowing smoke up my fabulous tush and this guy’s shotgun game was weak Me  “Sorry  sir  Nothing is working  Without a receipt or rewards account showing proof of purchase and date within the return window  we can’t take these items back ” Pretty Man    showing signs of irritation but acted civil ish   “It was a month ago  I used this card ” Me  “The policy stands  sir  I’m sorry  there’s nothing I can do ” Pretty Man    puts on the charm   “Honey  you are way too pretty to leave a man hanging  Is there really—”Me    stone faced   “My name isn’t ‘honey’  sir  There’s nothing more I can do for you  Please take your bag and have a good day ” Pretty Man  “Pleeeaase  you can’t make this work for me ” My manager comes from the back room  coming in hot behind the counter to me and boy  was she mad  She tells the man straight up  “Sir  my associate has explained everything to you  Please leave ” Pretty Man    taken aback and stammers a bit   “Uh  um  I was telling her—” Manager  “I heard what you told her  including your weak game trying to get a date with a woman half your age  I have security on speed dial  Don’t tempt me ” With that  the wide eyed man grabbed his bag of clothes and left  I suspected the guy was trying to return stolen merch for cash  and my manager confirmed it my suspicion correct  Turns out a couple days ago  she received a call from one of our sister stores who ALSO received a call from another sister store of someone matching Pretty Man’s description  in the exact same suit no less  trying to return clearly stolen merch and played the same prince charming act to other employees to sweet talk them into going against policy  There were maybe five of our stores within a sixty mile radius of each other and Pretty Man WENT TO THREE OF THEM  that we knew of  with his schtick We’ve had customers try to return stolen merch before and they usually blew their stacks when we caught onto their scheme  but not Pretty Man  No no no  he tried to catch more flies with honey instead of vinegar  thinking if he looked like a Men’s Warehouse model and used sweet words to get the ladies salivating  he would get some free money  Clever scheme  I admit  but poorly executed as it didn’t work at any of our stores  I grew up with low self confidence and never believed when anyone complimented my appearance unless they wanted something  so it was easy to tap back into my “Nice try  dafuh you want ” mentality Moral of my story  Use your head  Some of the most beautiful people have the ugliest intentions,5768,1038

493,jweh6h,1,19,TO THE WINDOOOOOOOOW So  this happened a few months ago during the back to school shopping craze that happens every year  Im an assistant manager at a small shoe store in the trendiest outdoor mall where I live  The company I work for used to have a popular style called Shape Ups and Demi Lovato did a commercial for them years ago  This happened on a Sunday  It was just me and my two newest employees  One of my employees was working her second shift ever  this is her first job  Both of them are very sweet  quiet  and sometimes shy girls  We were relatively busy because back to school is our busiest time of year  There were about as many parents and kids in my store as we were safely allowed to let in this year when a rather energetic and enthusiastic lady in her mid thirties came up to the register wanting to use some rewards points  We inform her that we have no way in our current POS system to look up any of her account information like points and that she will need to pull up the coupon on her phone and bring it to us  Like most malls in the U S  our store is a black hole for reception  and I have to steal wifi from the Fossil next door just to do my job every day  We inform her that she can get better reception by the front door  by the windows It is at this time that I realize that I havent used the restroom in a while  so I excuse myself as the girls are explaining the reception to this customer  I came back a few short moments later and there were tears in their eyes and they were struggling not to laugh Apparently  this woman decided that just walking to the window was not the course of action for her  Instead  she shouted  TO THE WINDOOOOW  TO THE WALL  TO THE SWEAT DRIPPING DOWN MY BALLS  ALL THEM BITCHES CRAWL  and the rest of the chorus while she walked up  In a room store full of children with their parents  no less  My employees said that conversation stopped for a moment because it was such a display  Thee customer bought like  pairs of shoes for     so I guess it all worked out  I had a few parents joke about it with me at the register about it  so I dont think too many people were offended  I just wish I had waited a few minutes to use the restroom so that I could have seen this glorious display,2271,437
494,jvzjhf,1,152,I want you to refund me  Its obvious you dont care about me OR my situation  My day started with this woman So I work front desk admin for a window blind install company  Most of my work is done on the computer and phone  but occasionally I get walk ins  First thing this morning  I return a call from a customer who left a voicemail  well call her Karen as usual  Karen placed an order with our sales representative last week on the th  and Ive been trying to get a hold of her ever since to get her on the schedule for an install after her items arrive  Its the holidays  the big  C  affecting our country  and our warehouse in CA  so shipping is a bit slower than usual   I tell her that we can do the install on January th or th since the items will leave the warehouse on December th I got a voicemail from her this morning  and she said the th or th is fine  Now  this is where I think the misunderstanding was  I call her back  and I state again the th or th  and here is our exchange   Karen   Well why is it taking so long      Me   I assume its the materials shortage our warehouse for these items is in California  maybe the spike in   C  cases pushed things out     Karen   That was ONLY A WEEK AGO  Honestly  this is false advertising and youre lying to people     Me   Maam we dont set the dates  we just do the order and install  They are all estimated as it is  it could be       Karen   Well you need to tell the manufacturer that they are falsely advertising   I want you to do that for me    I go quiet for a second  and I wont lie  I lay my head down on my desk and sigh   Me   Okay  I can do that  but the shipping       Karen   UGH OBVIOUSLY YOU DONT CARE  You wont get anything done for me  just cancel my order  I want a refund      Me   Okay I can do that maam  I just need to speak to our representative first to cancel the order      Karen   Well its clear YOU dont care about my situation   and I know you wont get this done  so I need your full name and number     Me   I do care  I will actually be the one refunding you once the order is canceled  I just need to verify the cancelation with our representative and the manufacturer first    She gets kind of quiet after that  I tell her my info and she hangs up I wont lie  I got a bit short with her after her telling me what I dont care about  Almost every single customer is on slow ordering now and I do my absolute best to keep them updated  Also  Ive called her and emailed her a total of  times trying to get the info to her  but I guess I dont get anything done Also  again our warehouse is in CA  Theres the  C   the wildfires  a materials shortage  Plus the holidays are coming up and the warehouse closes the entire week of Thanksgiving  Christmas  and New Years  Also  if she didnt keep talking over me  I would have loved to tell her  its just an estimated date   percent of the time the products show up much earlier  She would probably have had her items by mid December and if that was the case I could easily reschedule her to an earlier date  I honestly think she thought I said December th or th over the phone originally  and instead of saying it was a misunderstanding she just flew off the handle  To top it off  the representative told her it would take about  weeks for the order to move out  so thats not very far off from the date the manufacturer predicted the items will leave the warehouse  the th of December  The lady is not taking the holidays into account But shell get her Karma I guess  I told our representative everything  and hes going to talk to her  but since she took almost a week to respond to me  shes not getting her deposit back UPDATE  Coworker tried to smooth things over with her  She was nasty to him too  Wont be getting a refund but she canceled anyway    down the drain for her   So new blinds for me  I feel bad for my coworker though  but at least he wont get money taken from his sale,4011,742
495,jvkt9s,1,355,“it’s ridiculous that you can’t give me the refund because I don’t have the same card”  Had a customer come in yesterday for a refund on a   blind  She had her receipt  it was all within the  day time frame  everything was fine until I asked if she had the same card she purchased it with  She asked which one it was and I told her the last three digits of her card shown on the receipt  She tried to look for it and couldn’t find a card ending in those last three digits  I asked if she had used her phone at the time of the purchase as the last  digits tend to change on the receipt sometimes  she said no  She was beginning to get agitated  I asked if someone else had made the purchase and she said she was here with her husband when he made the purchase  I said to her that it was most likely her husbands card then to which she responded aggressively  “NO  my husband and I share the same cards”  At this point it’s going nowhere and I explained to her calmly that any refund made has to go back on the same card the item was purchased with  She said that she’s made refunds at this store before and no one asked her if she had the same card  Obviously she was lying because every employee at our store asks the customers if they have the same card the purchase was made on  I explain to her calmly  “I understand but I’m afraid they should’ve asked you as it is the policy”  She of course asked for the manager  I page my manager and explain to him the situation  My manager said the same thing that it has to go back on the same card or it can go on a store gift card  She started throwing a fit and snatched the receipt off me  She walked out angrily saying  “how ridiculous it is that we can’t give her her refund”  I’m sorry but don’t most retail stores ask customers if they have the same card they made the purchase on when refunding items Edit  the refund has to go back according to the method of purchase  If she had paid with cash  it’ll say it on the receipt and we’d be able to give her back the refund  It was paid through card  it has to go back on the same card the purchase was made on,2117,419
497,jv37q0,1,4,Where did the homeless lady go  Preface  If you’re triggered by medical emergencies or possible death  this story may not be for you  So I work at a pretty big retail store in my state that has many subsidiaries around the U S   which isn’t important to the story  I just included it for some background information   So ever since I started my job in early August  I noticed that there was always this homeless lady that roamed the store going from asile to asile day after day  She would be at the store just about every day  from open to close  Even when I went there on my days off to shop  I don’t know what her particular situation was in regards to her mental state but she would sometimes make really weird and random sounds in the aisles and it kind of freaked out the costumers from time to time  I am in no way meaning to make fun of her if she does have some type of mental illnesses or disability  Just stating what I noticed while working there  but we never asked her to leave since she was usually pretty quiet and we didn’t bother wasting the time or money calling the police or anyone else  but what we did notice  is that she had some source of income because she somehow had a smartphone and always had money to buy food or other items in the store  Anyways  managers at my store are usually pretty persistent on telling us associates to wear out ears  walkie talkie and earpiece  while working around the store since sometimes it’s easier to use a walkie than to page every individual associate over the PA  anyways  one day I was in the “employee only” area at my job since mostly all that needed to be done in my department had been done for the day  and the walkie on my hip stared to go crazy with things about “ambulance en route” “self check out A” and “homeless lady… medical assistance”  I immediately bee lined it for the self check out late mentioned over the walkie  which was now closed for obvious reasons  and saw  to my disbelief  the homeless lady on the ground  on her hands and knees  with the paramedics next to her trying to calm her down and  what looked like  them telling her to breathe deeply  About  minutes later the whole ordeal was over with and completely forgotten about until recently  I noticed that I haven’t seen her since that whole incident happened at the store  at this point a couple months ago   At this point I can only hope that the found help other than the grim reality that she could have been hospitalized or even died  I just pray that she found help and is  hopefully  still alive,2554,468
498,juzk53,1,48,Fellow cashier catches her alcoholic step dad trying to buy alcohol while drunk So for context  I work in a state that doesn’t allow you to sell alcohol if you’re under   This story happened about a year ago  I was working an evening shift and this very clearly intoxicated man comes to my register with a case of beer  I could smell him from the end of my conveyer belt  He gets to the front and asks for cigarettes  so I direct him to the only register that can sell cigarettes  The cashier on that register is under  also so I notify a manager that the cashier will need assistance soon for an alcohol sale  I also mention that the man is clearly intoxicated and  therefore  cannot purchase the alcohol  not sure if it’s the law or just store policy   He finally gets to the front of the line again and the cashier rings up everything but the alcohol  The manager goes to the register and informs the man that he cannot buy the alcohol because he’s clearly intoxicated  He argues that he walked there and should be allowed to purchase it because he isn’t driving  This confuses my manager and leads to  or  higher up managers coming to the front to try to sort it out  This is when I hear the cashier behind me screaming something I can’t remember exactly but it was something along the lines of “that’s my step dad  he’s an alcoholic” and “I’m calling my mom ” The cashier runs over and begins yelling in her step dad’s face while calling her mom  When her mom answers  the cashier tells her what’s going on and the mom starts yelling at him too  Long story short  he didn’t get his alcohol but he might’ve gotten a divorce  Not the craziest story  but definitely an eventful scenario to watch unfold,1711,317

501,juh1w3,1,109,Old guy yells at me while I help his wife pick out a vibrator  So  if the title and my post history isn’t self explanatory I work in a sex store  The stories I could tell just from my year here could fill a book  particularly because I work in a rather “methy” small town in Canada  I also work late shifts most nights so  it gets Interesting Anyways tonight I had  fine glossy eyed specimen enter my store and popped up a few retail red flags immediately  so I kept an eye out but offered my assistance and didn’t bother them while they looked around  For some context  everything in my store is under a magnet lock so I’ll have to come unlock whatever product they are looking for  They asked me to come grab a few items off the wall and put them behind the counter while they continued to look As I head back to the counter I hear a tell tale cardboard rip and see that the lady had ripped something off the hook and was examining it   While swaying drunkenly mind you  I walked over and gently asked for it back from her so I could tape the product back up since the box was all mangled now and she didn’t want it  As I’m turning around to do this she rips off another one  I turn around and gently say “hey could you just be careful not to rip the merchandise off  I can grab anything if you want to look at it ”She apologized immediately and slurred that she was just trying to see the back  I told her it was not an issue and took both items back behind the counter As I did this  Drunk hubby walks up to the counter and raises his voice at me as his wife continues to look around Side note  I’m incredibly kind and cheery  not in a condescending way  that’s just naturally how I am and I use it to de escalate situations so I’m being genuinely kind and helpful to this man during all thisDrunk  D Wife  W  Me  M D  We’re not spending anymore fucking money here  We would but we don’t wanna buy anything else from you ” M  “because I asked her to be careful with the products ”D  “ LIKE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE   I’m coming back tomorrow to speak to your boss” Me  “okay for sure feel free   I’m just doing my job making sure stuff doesn’t get damaged  Anything else I can help you with though ” my boss will honestly probably tell the guy to fuck off D  “NO  We’re leaving  “W   looks intently at the wall of vibrators  “wait hold on I like this one”D  “babe were fucking LEAVING  NOW”W  looking at  different vibrators  wait D   practically screaming at this point  NO  NOW M  “can I help you choose any of those ”D  “I SAID WERE FUCKING GOING NOW”W  “One more minute  Does this one recharge  Me  “No  not that one  But I do have this one that’s   off and is rechargeable   ” W  “and waterproof  “M  “absolutely  “W  “yeah I’ll take that  “So he stands with his arms crossed and brows furrowed while I grab the products for them and then he has to fork over   for all the stuff they grabbed  I happily bagged it all and asked all the basic questions  followed up by my best wishes for a lovely evening  And smiled because I make commission and he didn’t say another word as he left  I’m honestly really looking forward to seeing if he tries to contact my boss tomorrow Oh and I took down his license plate and gave  a lil tip there’s a possible drunk guy in a big truck who just left the sex shop    I’m still at work writing this so sorry for any errors I’m the flow of the story,3451,650
502,juf2iu,1,77,Guy isn’t allowed to buy alcohol and throws a fit So  for context  I work in a large grocery everything store and in the state I’m in  I can’t sell alcohol because I’m under   This story happened a few days ago and I was working with my favorite manager  A guy comes to my register with beer  wine  a couple other items and his  year old girlfriend  I scan everything but the alcohol and go get my manager for the rest  As per store policy  she asked for both the guy and his girlfriend’s IDs  The girl admits she’s not  so my manager refuses the sale  The guy threw an absolute fit and started screaming about how stupid it was that he couldn’t buy the alcohol because “she’s in a separate car ” He proceeds to tell both me and my manager that he’s just going to come back in without her and buy it  to which my manager replies “I’ll make sure you don’t ” He continues his fit  and even rams his cart into my register  His poor girlfriend was so nice and apologized for his behavior on their way out  About five minutes later  I’m on my break and buying a quick snack at the self checkout where I see none other than the big baby trying to buy his alcohol  I’m going to be petty  Just as the girl on self check goes to approve it  I call her over to tell her what happened before  Unfortunately  she approved the sale before coming over to me  I quickly explain and she rushes over and pulls his card out of the machine and takes the alcohol from him while telling him he can’t buy it  He acts dumb and pretends he doesn’t know what’s going on and I look him dead in the eyes and say “don’t act stupid  you know why ” He DEMANDS a manager and  too bad for this guy  all the other managers except for the one who had told him no earlier were in a meeting  Of course he is enraged and begins screaming and yelling again about how stupid this whole situation is  I agree   I didn’t get to see the end result as I really just wanted to take my break  The best part is that if he hadn’t been so rude and acted like a complete idiot  I would’ve just acted like I didn’t see anything and he would’ve gotten his beer and wine,2125,414
503,jtzqco,1,30,Not what I expected So yesterday I was acting as manager on duty and was striking through the store making sure everything was fine when I see a middle aged couple gesturing towards me to get my attention  My first thought was  how rude     And went to see what the issue was  Then they started to  ask  for a shoe size pointing to the size marked on the box and then I thought they might be tourist who didnt speak the language  No problem  I just started to speak slowly and clearly and throw some english in case they spoke english when then I notice they didnt have an accent when they tried to speak  it was more of a growl  and they spoke between them in sign language  Thats when it clicked  they were deaf and couldnt hear a thing I said  and couldnt read my lips  Well  I did my best to assist them by going with them through every shoe looking for the size they wanted and calculating the final prize of shoes after promotions    Even gave them some of my personal thoughts on how specific shoes looked  All of that with basic gestures and mimic since I cant speak sing language  Although at the end I realized I could just take out my mobile checkout device and use the notepad app to write down some sentences  which helped a lot  At the end they left with a shoe they were buying for a present for a really nice price and they were extremely grateful for the help  This really made my day and made me realize that we usually remember and focus on those one in a hundred costumers who are rude and cause a scene  but dont pay attention to the vast majority of costumers who are kind and grateful,1620,305
504,jtqm4p,1,11,A positive tale from my retail days This was originally my comment on another thread  but I wanted to share this here as well  I think the family in this tale made all of the other retail stress worthwhile for me When I worked retail  there was a couple that brought in their special needs son every day because he loved our store  I don’t know why  but I felt a need to connect with him—maybe I just really wanted to be extra kind to him and his parent  Anyways  I spend a solid year just waving to him and saying hi  to which he would respond with a brisk wave and keep going One Halloween I found out he loved Blow pops so I started keeping them in my locker and offering him one  with his parents’ permission  when I would say hello  which he almost always accepted  He really started warming up to me after a few months of daily hellos and lollipops One day I was talking to his mom about an order she had placed and he walked up to us with his dad  I said my usual hello and offered him a lollipop  but this time was different That was the day he hugged me  A real  affectionate  joyful hug  I cried right then and there while I hugged him back  I looked at his mom  who also had tears in her eyes  and told her how special that moment was to me  I was so grateful for that little moment Over the next year or so we continued our daily greetings  sometimes with a hug but most of the time with just a hello and a thank you  I knew his family was  in the process of moving out of state  so I did my best to appreciate every moment while I still could On their last visit to the store  which I knew because they had told me what day they were leaving the state   I gave Noah the biggest bag of Blow pops I could find and told him how much I was going to miss him  He hugged me tight and didn’t let go  so I hugged him back for as long as he needed  When he finally let go  he looked me in the eyes and told me that he was really going to miss me too I cried as I said goodbye to him  then cried more as I said goodbye to his mom  I let her know how special Noah was to me and how grateful I was to her for trusting me around him  then I wished them safe travels and a happy life To this day I wish I had taken a picture with Noah to remember those little moments better  but I still think about him all the time  I truly hope he and his family are doing well,2379,475

506,jtidqx,1,16,We  wasted   minutes of this ladys time because the check machine wasnt working So this happened in   I think later  I dont remember exactly when this happened  It was about an hour left in my shift and of course I was ready to go home  I think this woman come up ready to check out and it started out like every other transaction  I said my usual greeting and she was nice   at first  I finished ringing up her items and told her her total  She decided her choice of method was check  yes we still take check  Now I would like to point out  as it says in the title  that the check machine on the register I was on wasnt working  I know this because I had this problem with my last customer literally before my break  Luckily the couple was very understanding and patient while we were trying to fix that Anyway  back to the story  The woman filled out the check and gave it to me and after filling out the necessary information on the check  just some drivers license info   I then started to put the check in the check machine and of course as expected it didnt run through  Now I admit I shouldve told this woman that the machine wasnt working  but for some reason I was thinking it would work this time  So I did what I did last time this happened  I called someone over my walkie to come to my register  Now I apologized to this woman for the inconvenience as one of my coworker came over to help me out  I told her how the machine wasnt working right and I was getting someone to help get it to work so we can get her receipt  someone from customer service   Now this is where things start to go downhill  The cast of this story is me  RL  rude lady  CW   coworker    CW   coworker   who doesnt really talk or interact in this story  but does play a minor role   and M  manager  who also has a minor role   The following conversation may not be   accurate due to this happening a while ago Me  I apologize maam  but the machine isnt working  It wasnt working earlier so I will get someone over here to help fix the issueRL  oh   well I dont have time for this  Cant I just go to another register to pay Now I would like to point out that the money that she paid was already in the system so if she went to another register  she wouldve been double charged and her total was almost at    But I didnt know that at the time Me  well   um   So RL went to CW s register to  check out  and I stood there dumbfounded and not knowing what to do  A few moments later  CW  walked up to my register and asked what the issue was  I told her what was going on and my eyes shifted to RL who was at CW s register  She followed my gaze and she walked up to her CW   maam  youre going to have to come back here and finish your transaction  Your check has already went through the system so youre going to be charged again if you continue checking out with her  CW   RL looks at us before walking back over  Now I would like to say  I didnt really say anything for this next part  and as I said in another story  Im nonconfrontational so in a way I felt like I was being protected a little in some way from feeling RLs anger and frustration by myself RL  I dont have time for this  Im in a rush  Ive been here trying to check out for  minutes  it was more like   minutes   I need to pick up my kids CW   I understand maam  but we were having problems with the machine earlier so well try to figure this out  RL  well then I shouldve paid in cash shouldnt I  CW   Maam  let me fin RL  no  Hush and let me finish  Im in a rush  Ive been here for  minutes now  I need my receipt So after a few back and forth  CW  eventually called M over the walkie  She said she would try to find her transaction and try to get this sorted out I dont remember how  but we eventually got her receipt  I apologized to RL and she kind of ignored both of us and looked at CW   who was kind of watching this interaction happen  and thanked her for her help and left  At that point  CW  told me to go to a different register for the rest of my shift since the check machine wasnt working At that point there were  minutes left in my shift and I was just ready to go home  I soon then talked to CW  about the incident since I was just done with my shift at that point I just hope wherever that lady had to be in order to talk to us like we were incompetent  she got there on time,4462,859

508,jtajy1,1,0,Im clearly not a retail person  Several years ago I had just graduated with my degree  finally   and was desperately trying to find work  I ended up working at a local chain store  which is one of the only places in my small town to shop  It wasnt ideal  but I was  years old  finally finished with my education  and unable to immediately find something in my field  I wasnt stoked about working with the public again  what can you do  When you have to work youll take anything I spent a couple of days training  and then on my first full day they threw me on the main register  It was a Sunday which is one of the busiest shopping days  and I was a wreck  I have really bad anxiety  and situations like this just get me all kinds of worked up  It was going fairly okay  but you all know how it is  New job jitters and whatnot Anyway  a lady whips out a check to pay with and just throws it at me  Like she literally took this check and just tossed it onto the conveyor belt  Now my previous experience in working with the public was in a small country store and then in food service  so I never really had to deal with this  My naïve ass wrote the amount on the check  put it into the machine  which accepted it  and then she went on her way  It did not occur to me see if she had signed the check Long story short she hadnt signed it  and I got called into the office  It was for something like    and if your drawer ever came up   short you were let go  My boss was someone that I knew  and she also knew the woman in question  She was a regular shopper  and they just couldnt believe she hadnt signed the check  My boss managed to get hold of the womens husband via the information on their check though  and explained the situation  He came down and signed it  so the bank would then take it  and apologized for the way his wife had behaved by just throwing a check down and walking out like that was perfectly okay  I thought it was great that he was so nice  and I was glad to still have my job Fast forward a couple of weeks  Im in the groove now and working primarily evenings  which I prefer  Its a pretty quiet night and Im the only one on register while the manager is stocking and straightening and all  This is typical for a week night in our town  but when people do come in they sort of flock all at once as was the case  I got a few checked out  and then a guy comes up wanting a cell phone  Theyre kept in a locked case on an end cap away from the register  and I notice the lady behind him just has a couple of small items and seems sort of flustered  I tell him I will be glad to grab that for him  but that Ill check her out quickly first and then he can show me which phone he wants etc The lady happily puts her items down and I scan them and bag them  and shes literally already about to pay when he  Goes  Ballistic He starts yelling about how he was there first  and I cant just let her  cut in front of him   Ive already hit the button for the manager to come up  when he throws out this line  I came in and signed a check for my wife  I saved one of YOUR peoples jobs  You cant treat me like this IT IS THE HUSBAND  Like I had no idea  I wasnt there when he came in to sign the check  and he has NO idea that the person she had tried to stiff was me So this guy is berating me still as I wait for the manager to come  and the other customer LIGHTS INTO HIM  She turns around and gives this guy an earful about how a manager has to unlock the phones  they didnt  but she didnt know that and bless her heart she was trying to help  and he shouldnt be so rude and nasty over something so simple and how I was just trying to make everyones night a little easier As this is all going on the manager finally appears  as do several other customers to check out  She gets yelling guy to another register  where hes still complaining  The lady then tells my manager that the guy was being a jerk and that I was just being helpful  which makes him MORE mad  She did get him the phone he wanted  but he was still acting like the greatest of injustices had been bestowed upon him Maybe I was wrong for letting her get her stuff and go  but at the time it just felt like the right thing to do  It was the only register  and since what he wanted required me to have to leave it I thought it best to get the only other customer at the time out of the way before I did so  I dont know  but wrong or not it just felt like he had just been waiting to throw out that  I saved one of your jobs  line to make himself feel superior  Well  buddy  you wouldnt have had to do that if your wife wasnt a crappy person After seeing his fit though  I could understand why theyre made for each other  They are also a big reason why I quit that job as soon as possible and moved on with my life  Retail is not for me,4872,962

518,jrghr9,1,50,Broken return policy  I worked at a major department store almost  years ago   ish  I was stationed in the juniors department  And a sweet little old lady  about   came up to my register with a return  I of course went to start the process  Should be simple Now I’d been working there for more than a year at this point  and pretty much knew the items that we had carried during that time The lady put  bags of returns on the counter   And proceeded to mention that she didn’t have the receipts any more    That shouldn’t be a problem I tell her  as store policy says she doesn’t need one   But that without the receipt  she’ll only get back the lowest price it has sold for  She said that was fine And as I peek into the bag to begin  I see clothes I’m absolutely sure we don’t sell  But  they still have tags attached so I suspiciously scan one  Nothing comes up   I scan something else  Still nothing    I mention to her I’m having trouble scanning the items  And that I’d need to call over my supervisor   while on the call I mentioned quietly that I’d never seen any of the clothes she was trying to return  The sweet lady was so patient  And chit chatted while we waited  My supervisor came over  and looked in the bag  She just stood there staring  She looked up at the old lady  And said “ um ma’am  when did you purchase these items ”The lady replied that she had found the bags when she was cleaning out her closet  She thinks it might have been from   Which explained why I couldn’t scan  The register only had info for last  years   She called down the store manager and they honored the return  They tried to approximate what she should be getting back  She left about  minutes later  Quite happy  To this day the return policy hasn’t changed  You can return something you bought nearly  years ago  with little to no problems  Ridiculous TLDR Lady brings in nearly  years old clothes as a return  Without a receipt  Store policy allows it  Lady’s only issue was how long it took for them to process the return,2062,374

531,jq29ex,1,13,Customer blames my employees for stealing something off his car that it was never equipped with in the first place  So I work as the Service Manager at a local car dealer  Basically I am over the entire service department   so most of my day is just dealing with complaints  But I had a new one yesterday   and that’s saying something  So a customer comes in for just an oil change  This particular customer had never serviced any vehicles with us before  As soon as he checks out he walks out to his car and pops his hood and “notices” that his engine cover is missing  why would you go out and just happen to pop the hood open if you didn’t already know it was missing   and proceeds to lose his ever loving mind  Of course  I get involved  He claims that he just checked his oil yesterday and the cover was there but now it’s not  I walk back to my technician’s work area to check and see if maybe he took it off and just forgot to put it back on  which can happen sometimes  In this case  there would be no reason to remove it  because it’s not required to do an oil change  but I figured I should at least cover all my bases  I check around his work area  his tool box  etc  and there is of course no cover  I asked him if he noticed it  and he tells me that there was no cover on it when he opened the hood  So I basically tell Mr  Customer  “I checked my technician’s work area  and spoke with him as well  It was not on the engine when he opened the hood ” He continues to lose his mind and accuse my technician of stealing the cover  I looked him dead in the eye and said  “sir  I’m pretty positive he didn’t take your engine cover to put on his  entirely different make and model of vehicle  ” I told him I wasn’t buying him a new cover  He proceeds to tell me that he’d be OK with a used one  another red flag   if you were convinced that we stole it  why would you be OK with a used one   and I told him  just to make him happy  that if I come across a used one  if we have a similar vehicle traded in  for example  I’ll see if I can snag one just to make him go away  Fast forward to this morning  Walking by the detail department  there is another exact year make model vehicle that had been traded in and they were cleaning up for the lot  I popped the hood and  no cover  Thinking there’s no way it’s a coincidence  I go to my parts department and ask them to price me out a new engine cover  I want the part number and price  Parts guy puts the VIN in and goes  “what engine cover  That vehicle never came with one ” So this a hole knew there was no cover  he probably bought it used  and there wasn’t one there   and he assumed there was supposed to be  and brought it to us for a cheap oil change because he thought he could just freak out and we’d cave and he’d get one for free  So now  I get to call him Monday to let him know that    He is not getting an engine cover  because they don’t exist for that vehicle  and   We will not EVER service any vehicle for him at any point in the future  He is fired as a customer Have a nice day  jackass,3080,608

538,jnb6fv,1,22,Grumpy old lady Used to work at a gas station years ago  Most items had a price on the shelf  but vendors could change the price and it would be updated in our computers  If nobody notices the price change shelf price wouldnt get changed One Sunday morning I was preparing to leave and my coworker had a a grumpy old lady comes in to buy some lotto tickets and her V and the price on the shelf for the V    or something but it rang up    more or     She doesnt realize until after she s paid  then starts ranting and raving about how thats fraud to have the shelf price incorrect and how we needed to fix the shelf prices and how wed overcharged her a dime  Total meltdown yelling  I step out of the office as my coworker is walking back to the cooler and rips the shelf price off of the shelf and comes back to the register  the old lady is still ranting about wanting her dime back  I can see my coworker reach into his pocket for a dime  but he doesnt have any change  I do  so I reach into mine  pull out a dime  and toss it on the counter  She throws the time back at me  grabs her V  and leaves the store still yelling  My coworker sees she left her lotto tickets on the counter  he picks them up and holds them up so she can see them through the front windows  she yells  Keep it  as she climbs in her car and drives off Literally left a   lotto ticket there over us charging her an extra dime we tried to give back to her  I wish I could say that lotto ticket was a big winner so we could have had a really good laugh at her expense  but unfortunately it was just another loser,1609,317

540,jmxxgq,1,7,cents We give bag credits where I work if you bring in your own bags  Sometimes people bring in a bag  but choose not to use it  or they  left it in their car  so a lady comes in and after the entire transaction had been completed whips  out a bag they had in their purse and says  and my bag credit   I had already rung up the transaction and said  Sorry I already cashed out your order  They say this is un believable  your store states that it gives bag credits   I let them know that I was aware of my error  The manager walks over and  showed me a way to give a bag credit without doing a transaction  I opened up my drawer  and handed them  cents  They then left  I would have just given them  cents but I did not have any change in my pocket  I was also thinking about just having my till be short  cents but the manager noticed the customer was upset before I could make a judgement call,903,182
541,jmx0vd,1,129,Surely you just need the tags to return things    I havent heard this phrase throughout the  years of working in retail but trust me after hearing this phrase for the past  weeks now its driven me insane Customers come up to me with their returned items without the receipts and claim that they should surely be able to get away with that because the tags are still on the clothes items Im from the UK so I guess it might work differently  but I have never come across this  possibly seeing this sort of stuff in films and tv shows but thats it  IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOU MUST HAVE A RECEIPT WITHIN DATE WITH THE CORRECT CARD IF YOU PAID WITH CARD The tags dont do anything You see in order for me to process the returns  I need to scan a receipt  even if its been photographed  that receipt allows me to go through and select the items that need to be returned  they all have different kimball numbers etc   That way I am able to give the money back to the customers and finish the refund  If I scanned a tag it would probably not work or think that its a standard payment transaction   weeks ago I had to spend my final minutes of my shift  closing time too and also this went over my shift time  trying to explain to a lady that she needs the receipt and having the tags on the items does nothing  It was amazing to see how much denial and delusion she was in   But Im sure you used to return things with tags WE NEVER DID  If we did then it was probably  years ago  It doesnt mean we still carry the same philosophy today  Times have changed and Im certain that she is a frequent customer of the company I work for her so its unlikely she wouldnt have known this  Its incredible with what ideas customers come up with when it comes to returning things  Maybe if I just have the tags on the clothes theyll happily give me my money back Im curious  do any of you guys return things with just the tags and no form of receipt Enligten me here  like surely I cant be the only one who goes crazy over this,2046,383
542,jmr9kz,1,11,I dont think that means what you think it means   So one piece of background information  Cox Cable is a telecommunications company on the east coast of the US  This story takes place in their service area This particular story is  from when I worked for a particular well known tech support service  center attached to a Big box retail company with a propensity for blue  Every once in awhilea customer says or does something that just makes your day  I  walked up to the next client  to find that it was a husband and wife couple that had brought their computer in because they were having   with their internet  It became very evident very quickly that   wife was going to do the majority of the talking  She was one of  those people who can speak for  minutes to tell you her name  So among her long ramblings  I figure out they were having a problem with their internet and went to hook the system up to the test station to see  what I could see  While I was doing that the wife continued to explain how they had just upgraded their service package with their internet provider and that included such and such a speed and included this new router and just on and on and on  I kind of set my brain to listen to everything she said  but honestly  I was just filtering what she was saying She was going on about how much they were paying for their internet  and how much they and their kids use the internet and what they use it for  and when they signed up for the package  and they got this new router with that package but didnt get rid fo the old one and on and on and on    and then she said it  I should be able to click on the thing and bam  I have Cox in my face    Her husband responded sooner than I did with a snicker  It took me a moment to process it and when I did all I could do was a full lock down on my brain to prevent myself from saying something that would likely end badly,1912,372

545,jlxtch,1,24,When everything breaks and customers act like its somehow your fault and a personal insult to them  So this happened Friday afternoon starting about   pm and ending around   which isnt a super long time to have issues but it still wasnt great  I work at a hardware store as a cashier and on Friday I was by myself on the lumber end of the store at what are called the pro registers due to being located next to the pro desk and being frequented by contractors aka the pros  About   I noticed that there was some significant slowing down of the register processing card transactions  Weve recently gotten  new   in quotes because everything my store gets is refurbished and or hand me downs from other stores who were lucky enough to get brand new equipment  pin pads which while still buggy were significantly more usable than the old ones which had a bad tendency to only work perfectly for maybe   of the transactions  One of the big improvements  other than being fairly certain that no it really is the customers chip being broken and not a   toss up of the pin pad just not working to read chips again  was that theyre significantly faster at processing transactions  Also when searching for items on the Online Cashier Book  system thats supposed to list items from the store and have a function to search things from if they dont have a barcode but has the worst search functionality I have ever seen  aka the OCB  was running even slower than usual and giving me more connection errors than typical  Then the lone pro desk worker started having issues with his phone  In the middle of a call with a customer the line started breaking up so he tried to move the call to the other phone at the desk only for the phone to decide to reboot itself the second he lifted the receiver from the cradle  All else failing he ended up calling the guy back on his personal phone and kept dealing with weird issues with the phones for another thirty minutes  At three I get sent on my break and notice that the store wifi has gone from slow but mostly functional to completely unusable and now people are having issues with the time clock saying its not connected to the network when they try to clock in or out  Well this is going steadily downhill  Get back from break and continue checking out the sparse customers  Now customers who try to pay with a card are getting declined  First guy ran his card a second time and it went through but the next couple of people to try couldnt get it to work at all so I sent them to self check out in the hopes it was just my register having weird issues  Next thing I do is try to call my head cashier to see if theyre having issues on his end of the store  Oh would you look at that the phones are now completely down and nobody can contact each other anywhere in the store  And now a customer is trying to call the non functional phones which rerouted the call to the overhead PA system and its endlessly ringing  Yay So as Im sending customers down to the other end of the store saying my register isnt working Im trying to get a hold of anybody to see if they can tell me whats going on so I text my supervisors personal phone hoping he sees it quickly  Again no luck and it takes fifteen plus minutes and several more customers before I finally hear back from somebody over the walkie talkies we use for our lot loaders and they inform me that yeah all phones are down which took down the internet  or the other way around possibly  All I know is one going down took out the other  which then took out our ability to process card transactions  Theyre now trying to inform an assistant manager  again no in store phones are working so cant call him directly and nobody is sure where he was at first  to see if he could figure out what was going on  So then I get the joy of informing customers coming in that our system cant currently take cards which means cash only  we cant currently look up  process  or release any online orders  and we cant get a hold of anybody that isnt within shouting distance  Luckily were not very busy  at least on my end of the store  but the first customer I get who came in before we started having the issues  seems to take it personal that something went wrong with our system and that I cant take his debit card as payment  I apologize but he just goes on a rant about how he needs all of this right now and we should know when our system will be back up  yeah sure  Ive totally got clairvoyance  and how is it possible that it went down and blah blah blah  Cant he leave this on hold with us and we call him back when the system comes up  Nope sorry  we only do will calls for items that have been paid for  We dont hold unpaid items because they take up space we dont have  And anyway I highly doubt the will call system is even currently functional at the moment since nothing else is currently working By the time this guy is done ranting at me he decides to add more items to his order which is already well over the couple hundred in cash he had on him and then informs me that were gonna become friends because hes going to stand there in front of me until the system comes back up    hits and its time for my lunch and another cashier comes down saying that theyve had luck running debit cards as credit and to try that  which I suggest to my customer to get him out of my face  He completely ignores my instructions to run it as credit and puts in his PIN but by some miracle the transaction went through  I get a hold of lumber to get the guy the rest of his stuff  listen to him bitch about a couple more things then make my escape to get lunch  By about  everything got fixed again and we didnt have to continue to listen to customers whine about a technical issue we had no control over but it was a long  and half hours of dealing with weird slow downs and then a complete system crash  Later heard from another coworker who came in after everything was over that it was possibly a widespread issue since he stopped at another store before he came in and they said they were also having internet problems  Also another cashier said a customer said they lived in a nearby neighborhood where everyone also lost internet so who knows  But you gotta love the customers who think we personally made our system crash just to cause them issues,6413,1197

550,jkbyxd,1,94,How I kept my job after giving away   worth of product  For about a year in high school I worked at an international retail store in the US  Employees of this company would get a   discount on merchandise  Naturally I would use this anytime that I bought things for myself  However  as a cashier you see all different sorts of people in all different sorts of situations  I was seeing single mothers with several children who are buying baby food  wipes  diapers  clothing  etc  People who are in situations where they obviously cannot afford what theyre buying but they have to buy it anyways  I had the bright idea of using my discount to help them out  on the register or I was logged into  using my ID card  Do you see where this is going  It felt really good to see the looks of appreciation on these peoples faces  so I kept doing it I ended up doing it half a dozen times over the course of several weeks before management called me to the back room to have a chat  Apparently  whenever you use your discount on a register that youre signed into it creates a red flag in the system  The manager who was supposed to be tracking that was on vacation for a week at the time and didnt catch it until I had already given away   worth of discounts The two managers that were talking to me in the room brought me in there with the intent to fire me  they told me this afterwards  when they asked me why I did it I explained them and that I was only doing it for the people who clearly really needed the help  and what I was giving discounts on   They shared a look between themselves for a few seconds and I could see a silent exchange happen  They decided to keep me around,1703,320
551,jjuf75,1,85,No good deed goes unpunished So I worked for a dollar store chain when there was a coin shortage  We were encouraged to ask customers if they had change so we wouldnt deplete  the change in our till  I usually kept a little change on me for customers who were just a few pennies over so they wouldnt have to break a bill  Most customers were very appreciative of this One day  I asked a customer if she had the correct change and she said she didnt  Her total was    or something close to that and she was paying with a   bill  So I put in the extra change to give her the   change  She asked where her change was and I explained that I put the extra pennies in for her  She loses it and demands a refund of her transaction so she can pay with a card instead  I had to call my supervisor to do the refund  holding up my line for several minutes  The customer then blames me for the customers behind her being delayed  all over  cents  The other customers were upset  with her  not me  because of the situation I learned no good deed goes unpunished I guess  I quit a couple weeks later for a better job that pays more and is less stressful,1153,224

553,jjkqfa,1,23,A rude customer made me cry today  I recently got a job as a cashier  Overall its an okay job  not the worst retail job Ive ever had  Ive had customer service cashier experience for a couple years now so rude customers are nothing new  But let me get on with what happened I was cashiering and this older woman comes up to me  She says she would like to make a suggestion for me  that I start asking if the customer would like their receipt back after doing a return  She goes on about how she needed her receipt because she had other stuff she could have returned  She was pretty angry about it so my first response was    me personally   She says angrily  yes you  You threw away my receipt after a return and didnt even ask if I wanted it    Now  i have always asked the customer if they want to keep their old receipt after doing a return  If they say they dont want it  I simply throw it away  I guess defending myself became my downfall  I say to her   I always ask customers if they want to keep their receipt  she says to me  actually yelling this time   no you did not you threw it away      I said  I dont appreciate the way youre talking to me   She is still yelling at me and being extremely upset over this and taking it very personally with me  I have never had a customer actually yell at me before  I proceed to call my manager  and over the phone I explain that I have an aggressive customer who is yelling at me  The lady says   I am not yelling at you  Wow  You are a sad little girl and I feel sorry for you   That really got to me and I started tearing up  I dont even recall ever seeing this lady before  Again  she was very personal with me and even looked at my name tag and said my name  She goes  she was at that register and I remember the blonde hair and everything    To my manager when he eventually showed up  And she completely denied ever yelling at me or being upset  She said  I never raised my voice at her   She did  she was extremely nasty   My manager takes care of her and rings her up since she was buying stuff  I had to take a breather and go to the back and I just cried in the break room  My coworkers saw  I was just embarrassed and didnt expect to be crying so much  I wish I didnt take things so personally  I would really appreciate any comments on this post  Ive just been crying on and off today because Ive had to deal with so many nasty people lately  I just dont understand why people have to be so rude,2471,482
554,jjh22q,1,0,Self Checkout Mess This is a story from quite a few years back  The store I worked for was one of the first in our community to get self checkouts  Being one of the younger and more technologically savvy cashiers  I was tasked with running these machines  As the technology was so new at the time  Id often end up taking more of a teaching role with customers  showing them how to use the machine to check out as efficiently as possible  I like to think I was pretty good at helping people use them  A few months later  we were approaching Christmas  We were understaffed  no surprise  as we were always understaffed  but even more so than usual   so there was just one till open and the four self checkouts that I was maintaining   The person on the till had a huge line  and so did the self checkouts  An elderly man approached me with questions about how to use the machine  so I went over with him and helped him  As Im working with him  a mother and her  or  year old son  who is sitting in the cart  start using another one of the machines  I continue to help the man  but then I hear a strange sound I turn around to see that the kid has whipped down his pants and started pissing all over the floor  and let me tell you  it was A LOT of piss  I was a bit dumbfounded as to how a kid that age could possibly think that it was okay to do that  and to how his mom was seemingly unfazed by this  and just continued to scan her items  She finished checking out  and approached me  She said  condescendingly  Youd better clean that up   and walked away  I could understand if the kid was  or   but from my limited knowledge of child rearing  he was past the typical age for potty training  and more than capable of being taught that you dont whip down your pants and piss in the middle of a store  The mom just didnt care  at all  I think working in retail has given me both an education in what not to do as a parent  and a hesitancy to become a parent in the first place,1992,380

557,jj9t7b,1,123,Persistent Check Casher Okay so this happened to me yesterday  but according to coworkers has been happening since Friday  Like my last post  this took place at the gas station job and it pertains a certain customer determined to cash a check  It was a normal Monday night  which by that I meant   of our sales was alcohol since the store is in a neighborhood full of alcoholics  We often get checks written over the amount for cash back so I usually don’t think too much about it so long as they have an ID on hand  Well  this one lady came in and with a small handful of things to buy  delivered me a prewritten check well over the total for cash back  It raised numerous red flags right away  Here’s the thing  our store is the one of the few in my city that that takes out of town checks  But we don’t take checks from out of state  So if you have a check from Florida  you won’t be able to use it here  Her check was from Minnesota  though her ID was of this state Second was that it wasn’t a bank check  We will accept credit union checks only if the union is one from our town but we don’t take checks from out of town unions  I usually distrust prewritten checks  It’s my own personal thing  I prefer to see the check written when people pay with one It was over the total amount  on its own not bad  but the check was roughly  dollars over   is our max for cash back  It was written in red ink  And unless something changed  banks can’t accept checks in red because something about their systems  Save for prewritten  all of those are grounds to refuse because store rules  But when I explained it to her  good Lord you’d though I hit her and then threw her dog off a bridge  She was offended and pissed and kept going on and on over how we always take her checks  how I’m so unreasonable and being an incredibly rude employee for refusing  I explained to her the rules again and specified that Our Owners specifically told us not to accept checks that did any of those things  Oh no no no  she wanted me to call the manager  Claimed to be best friends with the manager  It was past nine at night our manager would have been asleep because she does the am opening  I told her that no  I’m not going to wake my manager up for this  if you claim to be such good friends then go ahead and call her  She didn’t  of course At that point she had gotten some others attention in the store and one of our regulars in the casino had come out and was standing off to the side to see if he needed to intervene  he’s a very big guy  but very nice  always steps in when our drunk customers get out of hand   I just told her she needs to leave Instead of leaving with her dignity  she threw the check at me and said she’d be back for her money  that she’ll call the owner and that I can kiss this job goodbye  and I won’t have any luck getting employed anywhere else with my attitude  Of course  she never came back my shift  I informed my boss and left a note for the manager in the morning  Found she’s been coming in at different times these past few days trying to find an employee who’d cash the check  Would have had better luck if the ink wasn’t red,3180,611

559,jiucl5,1,25,Sure  let me go get a screwdriver    Some context  I am a customer service manager in a large department store  Today  I had the pleasure of attempting to fix a non functioning register  The screen wouldn’t turn on  I am not exceptionally tech savvy  but I can generally figure out which cables go where and why and perform basic troubleshooting  When my best efforts yielded no results  I called tech support  Enter Juan  Juan  after walking me through the same troubleshooting steps that I had just performed  asked me to email him a picture of this register  It’s different than every other register in the store  Turns out  Juan has never seen a register like this before in his life  Juan  “Can you switch out the screen with a functional screen from another register  That way we can tell if it’s the screen or the cable ”I very quickly realized this wasn’t going to work  Not only are the other screens very different  the connecting cables are as well  There is no way to connect the existing tower to a different screen  I don’t have the right cables  I explained this to Juan  Juan  “Can you put the broken screen on a different register  then ”Me  “No  as I explained  I don’t have the correct cables ”Juan  “Then can you at least move the cables and a functioning screen onto the tower you are working on ”Me  “No  the other end of the cables aren’t the correct ones either ”Juan  “Ma’am  I’m trying to help you  If you aren’t willing to try then I’m not sure what else I can do for you ”Me  “Listen  The cables to this monitor are different from all the other ones I have  They are USB on one end  The other registers don’t even have USB ports  The power cords are completely different shapes  THERE IS NOT A HOLE THAT WILL FIT THE POWER CABLE  It’s not that I’m not willing to try  I CAN’T ”Juan  “Can you make a hole that will fit ”Me   after several seconds of shocked silence  “Sure  Let me go get a screwdriver ”I hung up on him  I do not get paid enough for this  I’d love to have seen my boss’s face when I explained that we had to ship a register back because I stabbed it with a screwdriver to accommodate the wrong power cord though,2180,389
560,jiqefx,1,13,Rain Check Please I work for a midsized supermarket chain  We have weekly sales as most stores do and our sale week runs from Thursday to Wednesday  As the sales week runs down  so do the items in the ad due to item movement or out of stocks  The necessary evil of running out of sale items is issuing rain checks  We try our best to accommodate the customer by substitutions  but generally they are issued a rain check  Usually our customers do not abuse the rain check policy  but there was one gentleman who always took advantage of it  Every Wednesday night like clockwork  he came in to  collect   his multiple rain checks  He is in his right to do so  but one Wednesday he stopped in his tracks  What he would do is go to the shelf  look for a sale item  see how many are there then go to our customer service booth and ask for a raincheck  The booth person would then page the department to see if there are more of this item in our back room  The gentleman saw that there were only  boxes of a certain cracker  but wanted seven   some items have no limits  and wanted a rain check to add to his collection  Well  on the this particular occasion  we had just gotten a large deliver of said crackers and were able to get him his th box  I brought them to him and it was this point he said    it wasnt  boxes that I needed  it was    I said ok and then proceeded to get him  more boxes  As I gave them to him he became flustered and I wondered what was wrong  He told me he didnt want the item  he just wanted the rain check  I said that since we have the items in stock  there was no need to issue a rain check  Then he asked me    how can I buy this item when it is not on sale without a rain check    I told him that he has the requested sale items and the transaction is complete  I explained were not giving rain checks out for the items we have  He spent another  minutes getting more rain checks  but for at least a moment  he was rightfully halted,1972,391
561,jin1w0,1,27,Being told to shut up  and what happened after So this was a few years ago  when I was still a cashier at a certain blue themed department store  We offered a no taxes discount on applicable items to those with a Native Status card  and to apply this they needed to present the card at the beginning of the order  we would check it for validity  and the order could begin  Well  one fated day  a couple comes through  maybe mid to late thirties  and they have a medium sized order  which I process with no problems  no indication of what is to come until I tell them their total  The man says they have a status card  and I tell him that unfortunately they would have needed to declare it at the beginning of the order for me to apply the discount  The woman starts insisting that we can do it for her  that weve done it before etc  So I call the CSM  Customer Service Manager  equivalent of a front end supervisor  over  explain the situation  and ask if theres anything we can do  I still want to help the customer at this point  even if shes been a little rude  The CSM explains that short of erasing the order and scanning it in again  this time with the discount in place  theres nothing to be done  The woman chooses that  and while the CSM is erasing the order  I say in an apologetic tone   Sorry  this is why we need you to show us the card at the beginning of the order   by which I meant that it would take even longer for them to be able to leave  Admittedly  this was not the best thing I could have said at the time  but she snapped at me  not an exact quote  but the gist of what she actually said   I knew that you could do it  so dont be stupid   I said something else  I think something to the effect of  Please dont call me that  maam   to which she replied even more venomously  and although I dont remember the first part of her sentence  I could never forget the second part   Maybe its time for you to shut up   I had never been told to shut up by a customer before  Id had my fair share of rude customers before  to be sure  and even been sworn at and had my intelligence insulted  but for some reason being told to shut up like that was the tipping point  because I did shut up  and after they were gone  the man whose order was next asked if I was alright  and all I could do was ask another CSM if I could to the bathroom  where I promptly burst into tears  When I came out  obviously still quite upset but not crying anymore  the front end manager told me to take my lunch early When I came back is when this story takes a turn  Apparently the manager and yet another CSM had been standing at the front doors  watching for this couple to drive by  and when they saw them  the front end manager actually ran after their car  and when he managed to stop them  went off on them about how they treated me and proceeded to ban them from the store  I hadnt particularly gotten along with my manager before then  hes harmless  just very outgoing and slightly odd personality  but this incident instilled me with a newfound respect for him  and a stiffer upper lip around customers,3117,594

566,jht50q,1,1,The Poor Cup I’ve written here before  but hello  I had to ring up a customer who looked like she just ran in from a rain storm  Facial expression  hair  everything  I would’ve believed it if not for the fact there’s hardly rain here and it’s sunny as usual   At least as sunny as it can get after sunset   They were a bit rude to me which made me mad later when I found out  She has two women  I think teen girls possibly  and a little boy about  or   Keep that in mind I’m not sure if it happened before I rang this customer up or after but one of my co workers comes up to the register and tells us about how another co worker found one of our mugs with pee in it  It had been far under a shelf so she didn’t know until she had picked it up and taken it out  I didn’t hear much about it from her herself till the next day when we were clocking in  She wanted to check the cameras and find out if she can see who did it  It was a fairly empty store  so while the cameras suck horribly  it would be fairly obvious who it had been if we looked We go to a time late at night but before the registers get counted  I put it on x and we watch several people wander through the aisle the cup was found  The shelf  best we could see it  was luckily in view and appeared empty  This group  the one I rang out later  That one   went into that aisle  Suddenly  one of the younger girls takes the boy into another aisle where we have ceramics  They grab something  I know already  it’s the mug based on everything after  and bring it back into the aisle with the other two  Then  they crowd around  and after that one ducks down  They’re all acting really suspicious but there isn’t anyone around to see  The girl stands up and then hides the cup on the shelf  where later  to confirm it  we watch as my co worker picks it up and then notices it’s filled with urine  I assume they had the boy pee in it and crowded around him to keep him hidden as the girl helped him  Even if it was the girl herself doing it  which I doubt  the boy was with them  They later check out and leave the store  As to why they felt the need to do that  I don’t know  If I see them I’m likely going to tell them they can’t come in after that  I asked around and no one encountered them  and they’ve never been here before at least from what I can remember  so I don’t know what their deal was,2372,475
567,jhq2fj,1,177,Dude  really  My store has a weekly   off a certain amount sale each Saturday  No problems there  Its the digital coupon for this sale that bothers me  Do you know why  Because it doesnt get priority over other coupons during checkout  What happened tonight really put that in perspective Theres an older man  possibly s to s  who I only see on Saturday for the sale  Normally  hes really calm  but tonight he acted different after I told him his total  The register didnt take his   off coupon  This time  he had an unused   off coupon that usually takes priority during checkout  He told me the small bowl of dog food should be free because of a vendor coupon  and it was  After checking and adding up his savings  we saw it wasnt   off  He asked if I could just knock off the   since the register chose the wrong coupon  and I told him Im not in control of which coupon the register uses  and he looks very disappointed Old man   So  theres nothing you can do about this giving me the wrong deal  How long have you been working here  that they havent shown you how to do that  That makes no sense  Just go in and take the   off instead  That  or change the price since Im a regular  Me  Im sorry  but I cant do anything about this  If theres a coupon thats less than our current sale  then it takes priority  This has nothing to do with my decision  I can ring everything back up and try again  but if the   off is all itll do  my hands are tied  He looks pissed  Ive never seen him frown  let alone look or sound angry  He tells me to take an item off to see if itll work  like that would change anything 🙄   but I do it anyway to prove a point    off coupon pops up again  and now hes finally calming down  only to see it was still there Old man   Now I know youre doing it  Theres no way it would use the same coupon TWICE  I dont want   off  I  WANT  FIVE  DOLLARS  OFF  Fix it or Im calling your manager up here to do it for you  Me   Sir  Ive done nothing but scan your items  hit total  and tell you what to pay  Theres no decision on my part  Theres also no change I can make on this transaction  I have nothing else to tell you  He looked so mad Old man   THEN TAKE ALL OF IT OFF SO I CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE  IM TIRED OF ALL THESE STORES TELLING ME HOW MY MONEY WORKS  THANKS FOR NOTHING  Me   Okay  Ill take everything off  Have a good night  He grabs his buggy by the handle  swings it off sideways hitting another womans buggy  She wasnt paying attention  so she was basically gut punched by the handle of her cart out of nowhere  I told him itd be best if he didnt come back here because hell be asked to leave on sight  Hell be banned by Monday  All of this over   extra  Shameful Btw  I was the manager tonight  He wouldve had to ask me to fix a problem for myself  He probably assumed I was the cashier because mine was in the bathroom TL DR  An old man throws a temper tantrum because dog food was   more than expected  then unintentionally hurts a woman out of anger  My register works fine,3081,580
568,jg6f4t,1,44,The Piano Incident I worked as an assistant manager for a thrift store  I was essentially the Operations and Facilities Manager as the store manager was fairly inept in those areas  how he got the SM job Ill never know Anyway  we had a piano that had been donated that had obviously been tipped over as the sounding board had a giant crack in it  It was an upright piano but was older and you could tell it was monstrously heavy just by looking at it  We kicked around the idea of what to do with it for a couple of weeks when my SM said to load it in our truck and haul it to the dump  We rolled it out back and there is sat for a week or so while I waited for enough guys to be on shift to help push it up the ramp into the truck A day before our dumpster pickup I got to work and saw a utility crew out back doing some street work  I peeked in our dumpster and noted that it wasnt quite half full  Not wanting to waste an opportunity  I walked out to the utility crew and asked them how much weight their skid steer could lift and if they thought it could lift the piano  A few minutes later  theyre lifting the piano into the dumpster for me  it fit perfectly The next day  I just happened to be finishing up loading scrap metal into our metal recycling dumpster when the trash dumpster pickup occurred  I tried to keep my cool and watch out of the corner of my eye The loader groaned a little over the weight of the dumpster and when it got to the top dump point  the piano got hung up just a little and he needed to shake the bucked a little to dislodge it  The driver saw me and shouted over  What do you have in there  I began making my way back to the door and just casually said   A piano  He was almost fuming   How the       did you get a piano in there   As I was opening the door to go back in I replied   Just roll it up to the dumpster and lift   like it was nothing special  I let the door close behind me but not before seeing the look of astonishment on his face I think he was too afraid to NOT empty the dumpster  Maybe he thinks Im secretly the Hulk or something but it was one of the best moments of my  years there,2160,424
569,jg5boz,1,43,Store gets backlash for not stocking more Halloween items before Halloween Ever wonder why stores always stock up on Halloween items in August  and Christmas items in October  It’s to intentionally get more customers to buy these items early  They further enforce this by not stocking up on more seasonal items as it gets closer to that holiday  Halloween seems to be notorious for this  as was my experience when I worked for a major retail chain a few years ago I was hired around Halloween time  so  of course  Halloween items were at the peak of demand  Contrary to retail’s practices  nobody buys Halloween stuff in August  They usually wait until mid September at the very earliest  Humans are notorious procrastinators  and will put off their seasonal shopping until the last minute  expecting they’ll get everything they want on or right before October st  Our store learned this the hard way By the end of October  our store was already packed with Christmas items while the Halloween section remained scarce  There wasn’t much left besides some home decor  cheap costumes  and a few bags of unpopular candy  My colleagues and I faced more than a few customers getting mad or cussing us out for no longer stocking anymore Halloween items  I remember my coworker getting an earful from a lady wanting a brain jello mold  and telling her “M’am  we had all these items up since August ” I did my best to be polite  of course  but it was still a pain  Thankfully  I didnt work on Halloween night  I can only imagine the horrors of a customer finding costume at the very last minute Moral of the story  artificial scarcity helps no one  especially not the overworked and underpaid employees Happy Halloween  everyone TL DR  Store stops stocking Halloween items by Halloween  Customers get mad  and the employees face their outrage,1848,307
570,jfyjk8,1,163,SIGNS everywhere  People still ignore  I work in a place that has two joined stores owned by the same people  It is a small group of about  total locations in the city  People KNOW we have two separate stores in one building divided by a wall  The stores do sell some associated products  but generally depending on who you are and what you need you’ll fare better at one vs the other  Basically the store I work at is the “professional use” stuff and the one next door is the “personal recreational use” stuff  We have signs  Signs on the road visible from the highway  Signs over the doors  Signs on the doors  Signs inside the doors    SIGNS People clearly looking for the recreational side will hesitate and read the sign on the door outside stating not only that if you need XYZ for personal or recreational use  go to the other side  but if you do not have a permit  license  and proof of occupation  much of the stuff in the professional side is off limits and we legally cannot sell it to you  They will then open the door  enter  read the IDENTICAL signs inside  blankly stare at the signs  and approach the front desk  We are basically required to check credentials and ID of all people that come in  Even if we know them personally because paperwork and clerical things can and do change in a snap  I get at least   people a day on weekdays  and   on weekends  closed Sunday though  that go like this  Me  Hello  How can I help you Them  I am looking for product X  where can I find that Me  excellent  may I see your credentials Them  Huh Me  Credentials  they come on a card like your driver’s license  and tell me you work for XYZ Them  Oh I’m a  insert any other occupation here   we don’t have that Me  are you looking for Y Store Them  Yes  That’s you isn’t it Me  No  they are next door  on the other side of the building  We only share this wall  Out the door and take a right and you’ll see an identical door labeled Y Store  Bonus points if they linger and insist on looking around anyway    there is really only one thing we can sell them without credentials  work boots  If they do stick around we are also required to watch them like a hawk  Many smaller items we carry could be easily stolen,2246,407
571,jfqcjr,1,25,The Poultry Catastrophe So I used to work in a grocery store in my town  and I have collected quite a few stories from there and my time abroad and I have finally convened on this location to share one of my plethora of memories   Depending on how this post is received I may pump more experiences out here  so I hope you guys enjoy Now I think many of us enjoy a good meme here and there  a funny joke etc   I for one enjoy humor and employ it as a method to both ease my tension and  hopefully  entertain the customer of which I was scanning out at the checkout line   It was a week before Thanksgiving and Im sure many retail workers know firsthand how chaotic that time can be  and so much jokes were much more prevalent   While I was checking out  my supervisor hands me a frozen turkey  stating that it needs to go back to the meat department and that shed take over for me while I go personally deliver it   This is routine and I thought nothing of it  so I accepted and headed towards the meat department   I arrive at the frozen turkey selection and place a turkey down within the freezer   It is then when a friendly old lady walked up to me and asked  excused me OP  do these turkeys get any bigger    Remembering a certain meme I had found  I chuckle and say  no maam  theyre dead    She laughs wholeheartedly along with me  and I tell her Ill check with the meat department since Im only a cashier and theyd have a larger turkey for her   She thanks me and I meet with the meat manager in their cooler and tell him about the customer   I then retire back to my post on the checkout line   Now  after this I hadnt thought anything of this little interaction   I would have forgotten about it altogether if it wasnt for my manager calling me to her office to talk to me   Apparently my joke had gotten a complaint from a customer   The customer had told my manager that my joke about dead turkeys was insensitive towards the animal and that I wouldnt be making those jokes about people so why should I with turkeys  I totally would by the way    We both agree that it was kind of stupid and that I shouldnt have done it  but she did find the joke funny so I think I got off easy with that one   Now a few hours have gone by  and I am on self checkout when a lady approaches me   At first she didnt look out of the ordinary from her leather purse  fur coat and overall karen esque appearance  and I met with her with my usual cheerfulness    Hello  my name is OP how may I help you  I asked   The lady reveals herself as the filer of the complaint  stating that I shouldve been fired for what I said   I accidentally let out a little chuckle and say  so it was you    Everything had made sense to me at that point   This lady had overheard my joke with the older lady and had taken offense to it   She begins to berate me saying that if someone were to joke about my death I wouldnt take kindly to it   I politely retort  maam  I wouldnt mind because Id be dead  and she starts fuming   I know I was stirring a hornets nest  but man was I having fun   However  even Nostradamus couldnt predict what this lady was about to do   With a smug confidence  she got in my face and said  would you kill me if I was a turkey    She then starts doing chicken motions and making chicken noises at me  and I couldnt help myself   I start laughing  and oh man it was not a gentle laugh either   My sides began to hurt but I couldnt help myself  this Karen just looked SO stupid   From the other self checkout kiosks I could see customers stifling giggles and pointing towards the chicken Karen  I will call her Choco Karen because I play way too much FF and chocobos are like chickens    Choco Karen  now finished with her poultry outburst  repeated her question    If I was a turkey  would you kill me    While I was enjoying this tirade  all good things must come to an end so I begrudgingly told her  maam Im gonna have to ask you to leave  youre causing a disturbance for the other customers    What I should have expected was her following wrath  but alas I did not  how could a woman who had an outburst like that remain calm after being told to leave  me from the past wasnt that smart    She demanded that I answered her question and I responded  no  I wouldnt kill you but I would call security if you do that again    We did not actually have store security  but it was a little tactic I would use to intimidate people being rowdy   Fortunately  Choco Karen seemed to be deterred  and as she walked towards the door she began to yell the standard spiel like  I wont ever shop here again until you get fired  and even called me an animal hater  I have two dogs and generally spend more time with peoples pets than the person themselves so thats a lie    I wont forget her last words though   As she walked out the door  she yelled  Your soul will burn unless you repent you animal killer    Now as my tale comes to a close  I cant help but explain the aftermath   A few employees who had heard the incident had told a few more employees  and through word of mouth within the hour everyone in the store had known of my encounter with Choco Karen   I would never see Choco Karen again  so she was true to her word but I would earn a title of  Turkey Bastard  which I wore proudly until I finally left that position a couple years later   Now  as I sit here several years later recalling the events of this story  which I am sure I may have forgotten a few details   I cant help but ask the question   Why was someone like Choco Karen in the meat department anyway,5613,1092

580,jeyiav,1,9,Morning Silliness So here is where I put my obligatory “I’m on mobile” spiel  I am a sales associate in a hardware store  and this just happened to me this morning No  this is not a Karen vs Robotic Employee  This is just something we all laughed about A nice lady came in this morning and came up to my register as I was doing the vicod cleaning  She came up to ask me if we had a certain kind of steps in our store that allow someone to go inside a building and had a weight capacity of  pounds  I thought she was looking for a step ladder  but she quickly said it was something else  My manager asked her about what she was looking for and was just as puzzled at me  until after I started ringing someone else up and the customer called her husband He said he’d seen them up front in our store  and then when she said that to me  it clicked   He saw the steps we use for things like stocking up front and thought it was for sale  Poor woman had to be the sweetest person about it  but she was slightly embarrassed about it and asked us where she could get one  We said we didn’t know  and off she went I smile about it when I think about what happened now  The nicest woman with the weirdest request  in our store and my day  Takeaway  don’t assume that stuff kept up front is for sale,1306,252

582,jevfrn,1,21,Ma’am   plus  does indeed equal  So this happened a couple months back  but I figured I’d share with you guys  So I work in a place that has tire center  and I tend to be up in the sales area helping people get the right tires for their car  We usually have promotions that give you either  or  off a set of  tires  The way the discount gets credited is that you get  dollars off of each tire install  so  total since it’s one install per tire  and then the rest gets taken off the subtotal A lady came in that had ordered tires a couple days prior  claiming that we didn’t give her the full  off  Now  this happens very frequently since it’s not obvious that you’re not getting the full  off  as it only says   under the tire price  I explain to her how the discount works  and clarify that she did get the full discount  She then claims that the promotion is false advertising  since it’s not explained that way anywhere I proceed to tell her that she is indeed still getting  off  and that while it’s a little odd in how it’s credited  we’re not giving her less than that  Then she demands that we give her the other  off  and I again explain that she already has the other  off her price  This back and forth continues on for a couple minutes  and I eventually tell her that I’ll get the supervisor to come help her out  since this was well above my pay grade Apparently  she ended up going to management  claiming again that it’s false advertising and that she wants the extra  off  Obviously she got it  since the customer is always right  and everything went smoothly after that  Just goes to show that if you whine and complain enough as a customer  you’ll get what you want  And in the end  we have recently been taking the full discount value off the cost outright instead of splitting it,1842,348
583,jev4qi,1,10,I SAID HORIZONTAL NOT VERTICAL  No VERTICAL Hopefully you guys enjoy this My job is mainly a desk job  but occasionally we have walk ins to drop off items for repair  The company I work for does blind repair  installation  and consultations  I do the booking for all of this between customers  vendors  and organizations     of the customers are awesome  and the people I work for are so nice its unreal  But yesterday I got  THAT  person on the phone   I got a call from a lady who wanted pricing  Okay  easy  Our minimum charge for a housecall is    and it cleans  horizontal blinds    apiece if you break it down   She said okay  She then asked about blinds over doors  I asked are they horizontal or vertical  she said vertical  I told her its    per slat  think generic apartment plastic slat blinds  but the minimum charge is still     She got mad and this was our exchange Customer   Each slat is      Thats ridiculous  you guys have gone up in price and you expect me to COUNT the slats  Me   Ive only worked here for about  months  I cant control pricing  If it helps  most vertical blind sets have about   slats  so roughly      per set of the vertical blind  Customer   I never said they were vertical  theyre HORIZONTAL I get confused   she just said vertical for the door blinds   but okay Me   Okay sorry about that  I misunderstood  Again  for cleaning blinds  its a minimum of    for a house call  and that will clean up to  blinds  That makes each horizontal blind     If your door blinds are also horizontal and they dont exceed  blinds  youll still be paying     If they are only vertical blinds  the price will vary but we still require the    minimum   Customer   WELL  WHY DO I HAVE TO COUNT THE SLATS  I CANT POSSIBLY DO THAT  Me   Maam we only count the slats on vertical blinds  and the technicians will do it when they arrive at your house anyway for the cleaning   Seriously you cant count to   Its that hard  Customer   Okay  so each vertical blind is     Me        Yes  I left it at that  She got so upset with me and actually yelled at me because she doesnt have common sense  She didnt end up scheduling and hasnt called back since  The pricing is actually not that complicated  From what I understood the first time she spoke  she had  horizontal blinds  and  sets of vertical  So the horizontals would cost a total of     and based on however many vertical blinds she had  the cost of them would be tacked onto the     But she kept using horizontal and vertical interchangeably and I lost track  Thats too much work for a Monday,2676,463
584,jeuerx,1,0,My nightmare working as a janitor in a craft store  First post here dont know if this breaks rule  but here it is I do not hold any resentment towards my workplace as a whole there were alot of good memories here but alot of them were calm of the storm deals  This is simply to tell the pain of working as a janitor in a craft store To set the scene this is fresh out of high school Ive never had a job in high school so I was desperate to find work and found this job rather quickly First day and they immediately let me know Im replacing someone that they had to fire after a month  I see why now   this is followed up by them dropping a manual in my lap sending me to the lunch room and telling me to read it over  I didnt learn this until  months later but that was not the right manual it was the maintenance manual not the operators manual So right now I have no idea how to work the cleaning machine and management has no idea how to work it cut to  months later and there floors arent getting clean to store standards  I wonder why  Im trying my best but again still dont really know how to work that machine  At this point Ive also had to deal with the stock crew smashing glitter on the floor  paint spills  machine errors and the cleaner used in the machine eating my clothing It got worse in month   Now in September they hired a new morning manager to oversee stock for the winter season  then in October they hired another manager to oversee the stock people and frame makers and then finally in November they hired a manager for the cleaning crew to which I was the only person on said crew  The worst part is he didnt help me clean he just made sure I did the cleaning and then helped stock the shelves Wrapping all the problems up we have  improperly trained staff  impossible to clean up messes  more maintenance problems than you can shake a stick at   managers doing absolutely nothing in there department  snow on the ground which means bigger messes  my clothes getting eaten by the cleaners and lastly black Friday coming up The boiling point came that Thanksgiving Day  American  right before black Friday  I normally had to spend   on pants so I could have work appropriate attire in my size  That morning my last pair had burn holes in them from the cleaners used by the machine I decided to ask them to even reimburse me half as that would be how much I would need to buy Nother proper work attire set of pants  They denied it saying I should be more careful and that uniform was provided by yourself not them  The day was just starting from there now I am off for  day as my city allows for janitorial under law  however during that day someone used the machine and let it sit overnight without dumping it making a sludgey glitter dirt mess that I had to wash out by hand  Now one last note on this machine the recover tank hose is hard to control as you had to stretch it in order to get the hose into the broom closet with the drain  This was the biggest reason for my pants being eaten as the water would splash up from the amount of water coming from the recovery tank speckling my pants with small amount of cleaner water  Couple all of this with someone yelling at me for not cleaning the Womens bathroom on my day off and getting mad about a stupid spot  her words were a  customer  complained about the back of the toilet in stall   Which is tiny and almost impossible to see in the back unless youre on your hands and knees looking for dirt  I was already pretty defeated that day and with alot of pressure to get the job done for black Friday I was almost at my breaking point  Finally after starting the dump for the sludge from the machine I noticed something strange on the coupler ring holding the outtake hose to the machines intake tank  It was leaking pretty bad and just as I was about to get the manual to see what the problem was the hose came flying off dumping me in sludgy chemical saturated water  I was pissed Among the now glitter sludge covered floor I picked myself up marched to the managers office and quit right there  I saved most of the tears until after because honestly I was feeling more rage than sadness but make no mistake that I was miserable And I only look back to say that was the worst job of all time,4322,813
585,jepfnx,1,14,The Tale of the Man who Comes into Mens to Steal This might be a long one  Im in mobile so pls excuse any errors TL DL  Man gets angry he cant shoplift anymore  threatens multiple staff  then tries to fist fight  cops So  I work in a popular clothing store in the UK  which has a mens department all on one floor  Since before I even began working here  we would have this one guy come in often to steal stuff  He would come in with an empty bag  and leave with a full one  Unfortunately the mens floor is often left unattended  understaffed I suppose  so for a while this was very easy for him His old method was to go into the fitting rooms on that floor  somehow burn off the security tags  not fully sure how  but we go in after hes been there and theres tags everywhere  and one time he forgot his lighter  However  right now all our fitting rooms are closed  This means he cant go into the fitting rooms to stuff things in his bag  so if theres anyone manning the floor that can keep an eye on him  he cant steal To paint a picture of this guy  he has two main traits  he always wears a hat  often ones he stole from the store  and he always tries to act like a real customer  The latter has always been annoying  Hell call you over to ask stupid questions just to pretend he is an actual customer  Some examples are asking the price on clearly tagged items  asking where mens is  sir youre there all the time   and asking me what leggings are  when standing next to the leggings   He was once   shopping   for jeans and asked a coworker which he should get  and when asked what occasion theyre for  he said theyre for a  party  and that said  party  was renting out Ferraris and driving about in them  Yeah  sure  lmao Up until not long ago  I found him annoying but not worrying  He wastes a lot of time  he spends hours down in mens  asks stupid questions  and makes a mess assumingly to try and distract you   But then that changed  The rest of this happened a few months ago There was a week where he was in every single day  But by this point the store manager was aware of him  so she made it so the mens floor was staffed all the time  no matter what  On about the th day of coming in in a row  he started to get antsy  since he was so used to the floor being unmanned  He started asking coworkers how long theyd worked there  and where they live Then  he went from harmless werido to threatening real fast We have one manager  who Ill call Audie  who takes her job very seriously  If shes on shift and is told hes there  she will drop everything to go to mens and keep an eye on him  A close eye  And you could tell he hates her  One day hes back on mens  I think this is day  in a row  and he tells my coworker  You know that foreign girl  I hate her  She should be careful cause she doesnt know what Im capable of   Yikes  A very annoying part is we had to tell our manager  a different one to Audie  that she needs to tell the store manager this Hes in the next  days after that  because this is retail and managers never do anything At this point  I go on holiday for  weeks  When I come back  I ask my coworker if I miss anything exciting  She tells me the following   and this is where it gets more mental He threatens  more staff members to their faces  He tells one of them that hes going to kill them  and tells another thats hes going to  destroy  her  At this point  the store manager is very aware and is in constant communication with the security for the shopping mall were in  Unfortunately  the security sucks and just says  we are aware of him  He keeps coming in  and is acting more and more unhinged  Store manager tells him he needs to leave  he refuses  Security gets him out  He comes back  She tells him to leave  he says he wont  and says to call the cops So she calls the cops   woman cop shows up  and is trying to get him to leave  He refuses  The cop keeps insisting  He tries to punch her  She calls for backup A lot more cops show up  and they manage to drag him up the stairs and out the shop  The store manager has to lock the doors as he tries to keep getting in  Hes still trying to fight the cops  so more backup is brought in until theres  cops He is trying to fist fight all  cops In the end  they pin him against the glass doors to the shop  in front of all the customers inside  and arrest him  and he gets taken away He hasnt been back since  thank god TL DL  Man gets angry he cant shoplift anymore  threatens multiple staff  then tries to fist fight  cops,4580,869

600,jbiar9,1,70,Had an old man come in the other day using a card for the very first time I work register in a sporting goods store  Old guy comes up to check out  I have to ask for phone numbers to sign up for the store’s coupons  and when I ask for his he says he doesn’t remember his number because he barely uses his phone  so I just skip it  He then informs me that he’s paying with a card and has never done so before  Based off these  bits I’m assuming this man’s from like the deep countryside or something  I get Amish customers sometimes  so that’s nothing new Anyways I scan his items and it’s time for him to pay  I figure explaining how it works won’t be too difficult  I just tell him when to insert his card  when to type his pin and we’re golden  I tell him to insert his card  He tells me nothings happening  I lean over the counter to see what’s wrong  He was putting his card on top of the buttons instead of in the slot  Bless his heart  So I show him where the slot is and we continue I tell him when to type his pin  Pops up on my screen “incorrect pin ” I figure he could’ve hit a wrong button or something  I tell him “Sir  it says that was the wrong pin  Do you want to try again ” He does and we go again  But this time he starts typing his pin before the screen pops up to do so  so it only gets the last couple digits  He hits enter  some error pops up probably saying to type a full pin wasn’t looking at the screen at this time and I’ve never made this mistake  so idk what exactly it says  he types his full pin again and hits enter  but the  digits he typed were still in there  so he basically typed the second half first and the first half last  I probably should’ve been looking at the pin pad at the time and walked him through it again  but I wasn’t thinking and was filing the receipt it printed out for the failed transaction  So third times a charm right  We try again and I walk him through it again  It fails again  We try swiping it because I don’t know what to do  It doesn’t work At this point I feel real bad for the guy  There wasn’t much else I could do  He’s evidently forgotten his pin  I ask if he has enough in cash  or a checkbook even  he does not  I want to move things along because I’m getting a bit of a line  My manager was helping at the other register and notices what’s up  so she tries to help  She tries to run the card as credit  That doesn’t work  We try it as debit one more time  but at this point all the failed transactions in a row locked him out of his card  I expect him to get mad at this point  but he just sounds more disappointed than anything  My manager informs him that he’ll probably have to contact his bank to find out the pin  He says “Well alright  I’ll have to go tomorrow because it’s  minutes from my house ” I feel so bad for him at this point  Can’t help but feel it’s my fault somehow  So he leaves empty handed  Hope he found out his proper pin  And wrote it down this time,2962,590
601,jbgrdu,1,10,Encountering a shoe bandit This happened many moons ago  So dialogs are not exact  etc  etc   I worked at a minor business in a major metro area on the West Coast  The front desk has one sales lady  The place is technically open all day  but the truth is nobody comes in after  A and traffic doesnt pick up until the afternoon  Also  my area does not get much homeless bums or druggies  They generally stay downtown  which is not too far away  where they can beg for money from a lot heavier foot traffic in that area    The tiny office has a regular ground level  and a mezzanine level  There is ONE desk at the regular level for the sales lady  and my desk is at the mezzanine level  Theres a small set of stairs in between  Aside from the sales ladys desk and office chair  there are some random chairs scattered about for customers if they are waiting for the sales lady  So this day started normal  I arrived in my sneakers  just purchased off a clearance rack  no name brand at one of those discount stores  paid less than   USD    I switched to my normal work shoes  and kicked the shoes under a chair next to the stairs   This is important later   Day proceeded normally  We greeted a couple customers  I watched the last customer walked out at  A or so  Knowing things will be slow  I told her  SL  Sales Lady  to holler if she needs me  I headed upstairs to my own desk  She knew what to do and I dont bother her    Lots of different tickets to prepare  stamp  etc   It was nearly noon when when SL screamed  HELP  OP  HELP  COME DOWN HERE   in a total panic voice  I was wondering if were being robbed or something  I ran down the narrow stairs  adrenaline pumping  skid to a stop  saw SL cowering in a corner  pointing at something behind me  I turned around  and saw a half naked bum  I kid you not  sitting on the chair next to the stairs  calmly putting on my sneakers   Remember that pair I kicked under the chair   Remember  this area of town  we dont get homeless bums very often  And they dont enter businesses  And this guy    lets just say he doesnt seem all up there  Brown  pants  that seem to be only held up by a belt  no shirt  no socks  shaggy hair  doesnt seem that old  slightly unshaven  got a bit of that happy but crazy look  on drugs  high  No idea   And he was putting on my practically brand new shoes  only wore like   times  that the shoe still shined  At this point  I was more confused than angry   WTF are you doing with my shoes  man  He just shrugged   Its all cool  man  I traded ya   Then he just walked out  with my shoes on his feet  lace undone  I looked back at where he sat  and sure enough  there was a dirty as  bleep  pair of boat shoes  with holes in the sole and everything  with a thick layer of dirt and stains  By this time SL has calmed down  She doesnt mingle much with the public  mainly just the customers  and never with bums  I can see why she panicked   She asked should we call the cops  I shook my head  By the time they come out here  the perp would be long gone  And what am I going to do  Demand my shoes back   Yuk  So just bagged that sorry pair of shoes and tossed them in the bin  And thus ended my encounter with the shoe bandit,3257,615
602,jbghik,1,26,“This is how you people do business  ” I worked in customer at a large corporation for over a year and have so many stories  One of my favorites is a customer coming in seeking “satisfaction”  So at our store we sell riding lawn mowers and the customer has the option to have the company come out and assemble it for them  The customer was unhappy that they did not also assemble an add on to the product and made a big scene  There is nothing we can do in this situation except to direct the customer to call the company who provides the service  Mind you  the customer did not even say what he wanted he just started complaining  So eventually we got the manager who explained this to the customer to which the customer said “I ain’t callin no  insert company name  I bought the product here and I am seeking satisfaction from right here”  He then went on to incredulously ask us “is this how you people do business ” The whole ordeal took about   minutes and the customer never asked for money back or any sort of compensation  he came just to complain  He eventually walked away yelling “this is how you people do business here ”It was very uncomfortable but also looking back quite funny at the overreaction to avoiding calling another company,1257,225

611,jagzut,1,14,Thats not how it works  Lady So this happened a few years ago  I dont even work in retail anymore but it suddenly vividly popped into my head just now and I felt the same rage I did back then for a second so I came straight here  So the shop I worked at had a policy about selling only  boxes of painkillers per customer  just because if they happen to overdose its not on us at all  Obviously they can go to more stores and buy more  but it just means that we werent responsible for selling them all  boxes they took if that makes sense  This was never a problem  maybe an eyeroll here and there but usually it was just an  oh okay Ill just buy two then  great  no problem  Anyway  a lady and her daughter come in and start putting their things down on the belt and I instantly spotted the  boxes of ibuprofen and said  ah Im sorry I can only sell you two of those boxes its company policy   she instantly snaps at me saying she doesnt understand why  I tried to explain the policy as best as I could  all while she looked at me like I had  heads  rolling her eyes every few seconds  She even said defensively  Im not trying to dispute the rules   but like  whats this then  She then says  right well theyre my daughters she can buy  of them separately  there   boxes per customer  I was like fine whatever shes a grown woman she can buy them Im not going to argue anymore  and so I put  at the back with a till divider in front  I finished scanning everything  which took a while might I add  and right as I scanned the very last thing this lady finally goes  ughhh some of this is my daughters it needed to be scanned separately   I  what  I just said  oh Im sorry I didnt realise  thinking internally why didnt you say anything  anyway she paid  I gave her the receipt  then I scanned the  boxes of ibuprofen for her daughter and said the price  the Mum holds up her debit card again and waits for the card machine  Oh great just what I need  I said  um  you said they were your daughters   she frowns and tilts her head forward at me like Im an actual idiot and says  theyre FOR her Im buying them FOR her  I said  but its  per customer I was under the impression that she would be buying them herself   This lady does the angriest sigh Ive ever heard and aggressively pulls a £ note out of her purse  waves it mockingly by her daughters hands for a second then slams it on my till  I just stared at  her blankly  thought you know what  Whatever I cant deal with this  Scooped it up angrily  shoved it in my till and started to gather the change  I decided to take a breath and not let a stupid customer get to me so as I gave her the change I said calmly  I am sorry  Im really just trying to follow the rules  this lady  snaps    DO NOT argue with me  I am NOT arguing with you   I was actually dumbfounded and said  more bitterly now I admit   Im just doing my job  she snatches the ibuprofen up  and literally snarls  oh fuck off  and storms off  The daughter actually gave me a very apologetic look as they walked away which softened the blow a bit  I wish I dealt with it differently now but I was younger and less confident  oh well  Anyway I know its not the wildest customer story but I thought some of you would enjoy,3277,636
612,jagwr4,1,6,Cancel your wedding    wait what So a while ago I posted a post about what happened to me when I got back from my honeymoon at Country Store T  In that post I had dropped a line about being asked to cancel my wedding so I could work  I had such an overwhelming positive response to share that story I thought that I would So I had gotten hired at Country Story T about a month before my wedding  I agreed to work there with my new employer knowing that I was going to be taking  days off in the middle of July for my wedding and honeymoon  I put in for those days the day I was hired  I made sure that the boss was aware  Written proof that I needed off with him signing it  I reminded him  weeks before my wedding  I actually reminded him the day of my bridal shower  which the day of my shower he refused to let me off at the agreed time of  hours early so that I could get ready  Instead  he wouldn’t let me off until my designated time  Needless to say I was an hour late to my own shower  Anyway  the week before my wedding the schedule comes out and wouldn’t you know it I am scheduled for not only the day of my rehearsal and bachelorette shower  but also the day of my own wedding  Reasoning my boss gave me was because someone else who worked there needed it off for her shotgun wedding  Not kidding you  thats what he said  And the only reason I had to work was seniority  I was pissed  But per his request I got other people to cover my shifts and I was on my way   or so I thought  The day of my wedding rolls around and I get a call from management  The floor manager was calling because my replacement had called in sick and they were begging me to come in  I politely told them that I was getting married that afternoon and to not bother me  The manager gets angry with me stating the boss had said that if anyone of my people calls in that it was then my responsibility to come in to work  I told the floor manager that it was the boss’s oversight not planning better and hung up  Not more than  minutes later my boss is blowing up my phone  I finally answered after  missed calls  Boss man was furious  Yelling and cussing up a storm  telling me that I had to cancel my wedding and come in or else be fired  Little did he know that I had kept the paperwork I had him sign to say that it was ok for me to have those  days off  I sent him a copy of the paperwork  His tune changed in a hurry once I said that I had it in writing and I was not afraid to call corporate  His last words to me on that call was something to the tune of that he would work it and to enjoy my special day  A little late now you jerk  because of the added stress he had caused I had a migraine and remember nothing of my wedding or most of my honeymoon  I was sick for  days with a migraine  How I look at it is that that boss stole away from me the memories of dancing with my dad  brother  and my sweet husband  Those are memories that I will never be able to get back,2981,598

614,j9k72t,1,8,I was just trying to get him to finish the process It was the holiday time  which obviously means all the customers are at their best  I was on register and an older gentleman and his wife approach me  The wife ended up leaving after her husband put his items on the counter and tells me that hes going to sign up for my stores credit card program  After ringing up his items and beginning the credit process  I instruct him to the pin pad where hed have to enter his social security number  When I tell him this  he begins to ask me why he needs to enter it because  youre not supposed to give that number to anybody   I tried to tell him it that he was signing up for a CREDIT CARD  but he wouldnt listen  He looks over to one of my coworkers  whose register is diagonal to mine  and asks if hes Mexican  he isnt   I simply say  no he isnt   This man then says something along the lines of my coworker seeing his ss  and giving it to one of his  buddies   I couldnt wrap my head around what this man was trying to tell me  I tried to assure him that my co worker   couldnt see what he was entering and    was busy doing his job  Finally  he enters in his number and we can finish the credit application process  TL DR  customer thinks my co worker is going to steal his social security number and give it to someone else,1338,257

617,j8af7l,1,13,Trying to return year old worn shoes Worked at a major department store at the returns desk  One time  I had a lady come up to me with a pair of clearly worn boots  And I mean worn  like the color and soles had taken a major beating  She’s insisting she bought them here and wanted to exchange them for the same boots but in a different color  I go to scan the boot and lo and behold  the style isn’t in our system  Now I also worked in the shoe department and knew all the boots that we had by heart  I thought the boot looked similar to what we had but was definitely not the same  different style name  a color I had never seen that boot in   At that moment  as I was trying to figure out where the boot had come from  I noticed that they smelled  No way I was going to let her get away with returning them in that condition  even if I could figure out what they were  But I’m not a confrontational person and this lady was already getting a bit too intense for me   I also had a line starting to form  So I made up some excuse about needing the manager since the boots weren’t coming up in the system correctly and told her to go see if she could even find the boots she claimed she knew we had in the color and size she needed  I call a manager up and start helping the next customer  Lucky for me but not so much this lady  the strictest manager comes over  I’m thinking that there’s no way she’s buying this customer’s bs  The costumer comes back with another pair of boots  I take one look at them and suddenly realize what’s happening  The lady was trying to return last year’s style  The company had basically recreated the same boot with some detail changes and a name change for the new season  I explain this to both the lady and manager once I finish helping the other customer  The lady argues that they still count as the same shoe because they look similar and argues she should get an even exchange regardless  The manager makes a point of saying that she doesn’t want to touch the boots this lady’s trying to return because she can tell they’ve been worn but then does something that I couldn’t believe    The manager offered to give the lady   for them to use towards the other pair  That might not seem like a lot  but it’s a lot more generous than I would have been considering the age and shape of these things  I especially didn’t expect this from that manager  she never let anything slide  I’m sitting there in absolute shock that she’s even taking this lady seriously  I’m also thinking “oh man  this lady really lucked out ” But she didn’t feel the same way  Lady is flabbergasted that she isn’t getting the new pair of boots for nothing  After going back and forth with my manager for awhile the lady slides the shoes across the counter at us and exclaims “Well you might as well donate them then  I’m not going to wear them and I don’t want   for them” and she storms off  I was like “first of all  you’ve already worn them  Second    is better than nothing so why wouldn’t you at least take that  And third  these aren’t getting donated  They’re gross    They’re going to be thrown away  Might as well take the   for giving away your old shoes ”,3198,602
618,j89k7q,1,64,A cashier witnesses true love I’m a cashier at a store at a ski resort  We have both groceries  little trinkets  souvenirs and stuffed animals  Last year  I witnessed a young man  maybe in his twenties  looking intently at our stuffed animals  He picked them up gently and squeezed them  He was so focused on his decision  As a stuffed animal enthusiast I totally understood  There is a “cuteness factor” a “realistic” factor and most importantly  the “cuddle” factor  After a few minutes  I informed him that there were some other stuffed animals in the store he might want to check out  He said “My girlfriend really likes stuffed animals and we have them all in our bed  I know really immature right ” “Oh no  Not at all ” I said  as I also have a ton of stuffed animals in my bed  “I was looking to add a little diversity maybe  We have some bears and an elephant but I was looking for something a little different” he continued  He did look at some other stuffed animals  holding two at a time comparing them against each other  I was able to ring up a few people and go out back to do some chores before he decided  He picked out a bear which I think was the right decision  It meant he knew what she wanted  I was having a tough day and this put a smile on my face  I really appreciate the effort and care he put into picking out that stuffed bear  It was so sweet  I wish she could have seen the determination on his face when he picked up each little stuffed animal  Hopefully this story makes you smile too,1527,285

620,j7ojtk,1,22,A Wholesome Speakerphone Story Hello  New to Reddit so please forgive me if my formatting and or lingo  etc is off    Please dont use this post elsewhere   My first post college retail job was for a cellphone company owned store in a mall  It was basically a long counter on a corner of two hallways  with two closets  one as an office for the manager  and one as my inventory room  I have tons of stories about this job but I thought Id start with a wholesome one to get my feet wet in the Reddit world   On to the tale   Despite being the inventory  manager   in pay but not title  Another story  for another time   I was also customer service  billing inquiries and chief bottle washer  So when I had a slow inventory day I would help out if there was a crowd  Two ladies  probably in their late s had a gentleman with them who was significantly older  They explained he was their father  and he was deaf as a post  but they wanted him to have a phone for emergencies  and so they could be in touch more often  The issue was  they werent sure anything we carried would be loud enough   I knew my inventory backwards and forwards so I picked out the phones with the best audio and we went through them  I would activate one  give it a test call from down the hallway in the mall and hed put it to his ear  Thumbs up meant he could hear me  thumbs down meant he couldnt   All three were thumbs down  Okay next  Tried the ones with the best speaker phones  Thumbs down each time   We went through every phone I had  His daughters were disappointed  but appreciative that I tried  I  however  was not about to give up   Last ditch effort  I grabbed a cheap Motorola that wed already tested and ran into my inventory room  In my  old accessories that well probably never sell  box  I pulled out a small  semi spherical attachment  It was supposed to be used so you could put your phone on the conference table and have a conference call with a bunch of folks   I stuck it in and told him to hold the phone upside down  He looked at me like I was nuts  He put it to his ear and I walked down the hall  I made the call  he answered and I said   can you hear me  Sir    A miracle  His head jerked away from the phone as the volume was definitely in his range  He lit up  his daughters lit up  They rushed down to me and talked to him on the phone to see how it sounded and he talked back  They had a brief conversation and I came back to the counter  The man was in tears he was so happy  and I got a bit choked up myself    I didnt often get to say   I made someones life better today   back then  but that was a good day to be at work   Thanks for reading,2698,525
621,j7j3dg,1,32,It’s a Hard Ops Life    You Ordered How Much  Hello TFR  I’ve got a few great stories to share that are a little different from the usual “Weirdo Customer” or “Terrible Manager” ones  I have stories from  the back room   The stock room receiving whatever else you’d call it First  some background context  I’ve been in retail for  ish years  with my current company  Big Office Supply Chain  for   and have recently been promoted from Tech Sales Associate to Inventory Ops Specialist  Comes with managerial responsibilities and authority  My predecessor was  for lack of a politer way to say it  incompetent Within the first month of my new position  my store manager calls me back to his office to reach me how to place orders for specific stock from the warehouse that they’re either hoarding or not sending as much as we could be selling  We have a brief conversation about one of my predecessor’s numerous fuckups  gt  SM  So  you input the item number and the quantity  Just consider what the item is when deciding the quantity  I showed  Predecessor  this and ordered  of something small as an example  and they ordered  for everything thinking that was just  the  number  gt  Me  And that’s how we wound up with so much of that one toner  the phones  and the trackball mice that we’re just now    months later  getting rid of  Got it So  we order that week and things go well  May have accidentally ordered  too many of a keyboard  but it’s just one item  and they sold pretty quick  But fast forward  weeks   I’m receiving truck  and get told it’ll be  pallets  our usual high end for delivery is     What could it be  So I look through the orders    SM ordered   off brand alcohol wipes   and a half of the  pallets  are the boxes of these wipes  So I head to his office as he gets in  gt  Me  You ordered     how many  of those wipes  gt  SM     But the warehouse never sends all of it when you ask for that much  gt  Me  Well  they did and they are    on the truck today We go back and forth for a bit before I pull up the expected delivery manifest and show him the item with K in the quantity  He assured me it’ll sell fast and it won’t be an issue  Fast forward again   It’s been  a month  give or take a week  We still have  full pallets of these damn wipes sitting in the stock room  with  pallets worth out on the floor in stacked display to try and sell them  They’re not Clorox  or our brand which is packaged similarly and get confused for Clorox  though  So most people pass right by So  the major lesson I learned about ordering stock  order only what the store can reasonably sell  Even if they don’t give you everything you ask for  you don’t clog receiving for a month,2753,492
622,j72r5d,1,25,Never trust a man named The Puffin Around a decade ago  after my first summer in college  I took a job in a now defunct bookstore chain  It was one of the more interesting jobs I have ever had  Like most corporate bookstores  our treatment depended on how many membership cards we could sell per shift  Being in a torust heavy area  not many people wanted membership in a regional bookstore  Despite the headaches thos caused  we did have a handful of local characters who frequented the store  one of whom was a man who called himself The Puffin  The man clearly had issues but he was generally friendly enough and we usually let him hang out in the store and read  Of all my coworkers  I got along the most with the assistant manager who had taken le under his wing  The assistant manager did not care for The Puffin and considered him a loiterer  One evening when we were getting ready to close up shop  the assistant went to wake The Puffin so hed leave  The Puffin proceeded to let out a royal squawk and proceeded to punch my boss in the face  He proceeded to rocket around the store and knocked over some shelves  The assistant manager  sporting a bloody nose began yelling at me to call the cops  The cops finally arrived and were able to apprehend The Puffin  who was cackling like a maniac when he was led out  The assistant manager began to chew me out for not going after The Puffin  Assistant boss man had such a dry sense of humor that to this day Im still not sure if he was really mad at me for not intervening   At that point in my life I weighed maybe a buck twenty five soaking wet and The Puffin had a good foot on me so I was not planning on brawling in the bookstore   On one of my last shifts before summer ended  I see a man enter the store and shout  Im back bitches    The next thing I hear from assistant bossman is  Thatparkerluck  call the bleeping cops now   After hanging up my bookstore apron and going back to school  I didnt think much of The Puffin until I took some shifts at the bookstore when I was home for winter break  At one point  I was in the back office and noticed an obituary on the wall  It was for The Puffin  Assistant bossman said that the bookstore staff were some of the only people at the funeral aside from the minister who helped bury the homeless  Assistant bossman gave the eulogy  Of anyone I have ever met in my years of retail  I will never forget The Puffin,2432,457

624,j6rfvt,1,123,I do work her but I’m not working right now  I’m on mobile and please don’t use my story anywhere else  I worked women’s clothing retail for years  I walked into the store I managed about ten minutes before my shift one day  I get two steps into the store when I get stopped by a customer  Now granted I have my sunglasses on and I’m carrying my purse  lunch bag and my binder that I keep my schedule in  Clearly you can tell I just got there and in no way  shape  or form am I working yet  This lady starts going on and on about how we don’t have what she wants  I look at her over the top of my sunglasses and tell her “ma’am if you would be so kind as to go to the register and let my employees know what you’re looking for they will be able to help you  I just got here and I haven’t even clocked in yet ” She tells me I’m rude and not very customer friendly  I get to the registers and I tell my girls to go help the woman up front find some stuff and get her a dressing room started  One of the girls comes to the back room where I’m getting settled for the day and says “this lady is PISSED at you  She says you’re the rudest person she’s ever seen and wants to talk to the store manager ” I tell my employee to have the manager on duty handle it as I’m not on the clock yet and I need to handle some personal stuff before I clock in  My assistant talks to the lady apologized and tried to explain to her that I had just walked in and was clocked in for my shift and that I was polite about letting her know that I wasn’t on the clock yet  Meanwhile I’m in the back on the phone with my dm and I run out to clock in real fast and go back to the back  I finish up my phone call with my dm and I go out on the floor  The lady walks up to me and says “I want you to know I didn’t appreciate the attitude from you when I asked you if you had something  I apologized and said “ma’am I had just walked in to come to work  I had on my sunglasses  purse  lunch bag and I was not clocked in  There were two other people working at the time and you could have asked them  For all you knew I could have been a shopper just like you  Now that I’m here and ready to work if there is anything else I can help you with please let me know”  She stayed away from me the rest of the time she shopped  We got a call three days later from my dm because she wrote in to corporate complaining about me  The regional and territorial managers both wanted to know what happened because this was unlike me to “be this rude to someone”  My dm told them the story and said she would call the lady and talk with her  The lady wanted me fired and my dm flat refused  She said I’m not firing one of my best managers that have been with me for years because you felt she was rude when you tried to ask her questions when she wasn’t on the clock  That manager pours her heart and soul into that store to keep it running and treats every single person that walks through her doors the same and is welcoming to everyone  The fact that you failed to listen to her when she told you she wasn’t clocked in and to go to her employees who were clocked in tells me you aren’t very considerate  How would you like to be stopped and asked questions before you were able to clock in for your shift  You wouldn’t because you wouldn’t be getting paid for that  Well same thing here  She’s not allowed to work off the clock and did the right thing by directing you to someone who could help you ” The lady wasn’t happy about this and ended hanging up on my dm  Dm wasn’t too worried about it because the woman was in the wrong and the regional and territorial managers understood,3648,735
625,j6qo59,1,78,Woman admitted to ruining her own shoes and wanted a refund I work at a major chain shoe store  A few days ago a woman walked in with a pair of shoes she was looking to return  No box  no receipt  Normally this is an immediate no but we will take one if it is clearly a manufacturer defect  She takes the shoes out of her bag and explains that she put them in the washing machine and now theyre ruined  The shoes were shrunken and malformed and the memory foam soles were all messed up  I said   maam  we cant take a return for this  These are not washable shoes    I put all my shoes in the washing machine  though  Why did these get ruined   Probably because theyre not a machine washable material  We sell shoes that you can put in the washing machine and they have a sticker on the box that says so    Well then how am I supposed to wash these shoes then  I was baffled because most types of shoes are not washing machine safe   The same way you clean most shoes  Cleaning solution and a towel   It was very obvious that these were a type of shoes that could not go in a washing machine but the woman would not leave  She started making up problems with the shoes and kept insisting on a return  Eventually I gave up and left to grab my manager to shut the lady up  When I returned to the counter  the woman was complaining to my coworker about her ruined shoes in a desperate attempt to get a refund  In all  it probably took  minutes to get it into this daft womans head that she ruined our shoes and it wasnt our fault  I have SO many stories about morons at this job and this is just one that sticks out in my memory,1651,314

627,j6op4b,1,14,The bag was almost as tall as her So I used to work at a rather large FL clothing store as a  jack of all trades   Basically I did everything from shipping  go backs  register  fitting rooms   etc  Our loss prevention officer was NEVER around  to the point that to save his job he would be willing to fire employees for BS reasons to save face  As a result of this my bosses made whoever was on the sales floor do LPs job until they realized that I was the best at it and made ME LP whenever there was someone actively stealing  Ive dealt with a lot of really crazy customers who were actively stealing as a result  some of which were obviously completely intoxicated from drugs or alcohol or would even have the stolen products visible in their handbags   So onto the story  I was working saturday night and this young couple who were pretending not to know each other were VERY obviously stealing  I was put in charge of watching them so for over an hour I had to hang outside the fitting rooms just watching them  going through anything they would put onto the return rack for evidence  I would never watch people like this normally however they were being blatantly obvious  Big cart filled with multiples of the same items in random sizes and yes they really were in there for over an hour  They had no idea I was watching them since I was pretending to work in that section on the tables however whenever I asked if they needed any help the woman would look nervous but try to hide it  As I searched the clothing they put back I found around   worth in ripped off tags that they tried to hide as well as hangers clipped to a shirts interior or doubled up on the same item   As I am watching them out of nowhere I saw this HUGE teal rectangular bag floating and moving in the aisle  for a second I thought that I mustve been losing my mind so I did a double take and it was this tiny  middle aged woman and the bag was almost as tall as she was  The bag was FILLED to the brim and I just knew it couldnt be anything good however since I was stuck watching the couple still I called my manager over the walkie  When I did that she was initially annoyed and dismissive  She ignored me for over  minutes as I was trying to watch all  active steales until she finally responded  When I told her about the lady she flipped out  she dropped anything and everything she was doing and immediately went to me  She asked me where she was and so I pointed at her  My manager couldnt see her over the aisles but then saw her monsterous teal bag  She went up to the lady   said  things and then confiscated her bag  THE BAG WASNT EVEN HERS  SHE STOLE THE BAG FROM OUR STORE AND IT WAS FILLED WITH STOLEN ITEMS  She left very quickly after to avoid being arrested however this lady tried to steal    worth in products  She EVEN took ALL of the products out of their boxes to fill the bag up as much as possible  Later on that night after the couple left with their stolen goods   not allowed to confront them for legal reasons  we found a cart FILLED with empty boxes and tags  they were ALL from the woman we confiscated the bag from  It was honestly too crazy however I never saw her again and I got a HUGE reward for catching her in the act before she could walk out of the store  I now finally understand the saying that you cant have your cake and eat it too  TLDR  small  woman tried to steal    on products with bag almost as tall as she was that she stole from our store  Also throwaway becuase Im too busy with life to respond,3565,685
628,j6gtdd,1,2,Customer wanted to return something they no longer had I work for one of the largest chain auto repair companies  They consider them selves retail   the word retail is literally in the name of our Parent company  BSRO  Bridgestone Retail Operations  We have a policy of  day buy and try with tires  If you get a tire that we sell  dont like it for what ever legit reason you can get another similar tire for the cost difference  Ex  if you get a   set of tires on your luxury car and they ride rough you could upgrade to a better   set and pay the   difference  The ones we take off are marked and sent back to the company  they arent re sold Today we had a customer call up  I put a set of Destination XTs on his truck  They are a newer tire  Anything like this is special order to begin with Its Mud terrain that are less aggressive than the standard M T  Guy wants to use the  day buy and try  He totaled his truck yesterday and its a total loss wants to use the policy to get his money back  Boss has to explain to him several different ways that its just to upgrade to something else  He would have to bring his truck in thats totaled  and we could install a different set of tires on it but we dont just hand you money because you totaled it days after buying special order mud tires,1312,250
629,j6gbbp,1,10,Thanks  but no thanks Im a manager at a mom and pop store that sells just about everything you can think of  so were well known in the neighborhood Earlier today Im walking from the back of the store towards the register and as I get closer I hear my cashier say  youll need to talk to the manager about that   Oh boy  here we go     So since I overheard  I stepped up and realized that this man walked right up next to a lady who was having her basket full of items rung up  and just rudely interrupted  Heres how the conversation went Me  What can I do for you Him  Im moving and I had these cassette tapes that I wanted to donate Me   confused because I wasnt sure I heard right  Cassette tapes Him  Yeah  the ones that play on a reel   I may be paraphrasing here He holds them out and I just looked at the boxes and then back at him Me  Oh  we dont have a cassette player Him   Well I meant for your customers Me   stares I honestly didnt know how to react  Theres nothing about our store to suggest that our customers want used cassette tapes  Our customers drive luxury cars and pay   for a single dish towel  He ended up making a strange noise and walking out the door before I could say anything else,1241,227
630,j6g5g1,1,3,Hose Mad  So because people wash their cars  auto parts stores sell hose attachments  One particular older man came into my store awhile back and bought  amongst other things  one of those multi use hose nozzles with the rotating face  I remember noting as one of us rang up his purchase  that Id never seen anyone buy one off us He was back about an hour later  and he wasnt happy  Apparently it squirted water on him off the side of the dial and he had the wet spot on his sweatshirt to prove it  He wanted another one  I was happy to oblige  but the classic trope arises He had no receipt Fortunately we had a non receipt return option  and having remembered him from earlier I was still willing to do this for him  but the computer systems next request proved problematic in this case  the computer scans a barcode on the back of a drivers license  presumably to better ID someone if theyre returning a stolen good  The man doesnt have his ID  He walked to our store and with his age he wasnt in the mood to walk laps to deal with an item that was well under  dollars  So understandably frustrated  he opted to buy a different hose attachment we had that looked less cheap  and when I asked what he wanted to do about the broken one  he told me to keep it   It was in fact broken  and further broke itself falling off a table  The part of this story thats always stuck with me was as this reasonably frustrated old man was getting cashed out by me I hand him his stuff and reflexively tell him to  have a nice day   I dont remember what he quipped back with first  but because my wit is as sharp as a bowling ball I just stood there awkwardly  To which he looked me dead in the eye and said  I just got HOSED   he turned around  and walked out of the store TLDR  puns dont help with your ho se problems  And dont treat your receipts as a wash  Unless you got plenty of cash to sprinkle around,1920,358
631,j6f1f1,1,3,Which One  Ill try to keep this as curt and not strange as possible  So  Ive completed to interviews and received job offers  One is a front desk position  and the other is a  sales associate position at a popular thrift store  Ive been trying to get a clerical receptionist position for the longest time  and Im super excited and blessed to have received these offers  However  Im kind of stuck  So  both jobs pay the same amount  The front desk position is the base plus a commission and yearly bonus  BUT at the clothing store  the manager has offered to make me a supervisor after two months  the original supervisor somehow circumvented the rules so that we have to wait until the system automatically terminates her before anyone else can fill the role   I really need the clerical experience of the front desk position  but the supervisor position could help me as well and I would not have to wait too long to receive it My main concern is that by the time Im supposed to become a supervisor the manager will rescind the offer of become vague and hesitate to give me the offer  I have no way of verifying whether or not shes truthful or just trying to say anything to have me join her staff  Any and all advice is appreciated just please be kind  Much love,1284,231
632,j6bf09,1,3,Follow that Spoderman  Hello  This is a follow up post from last month  Im on mobile  so please excuse the formatting This happened a week after the first sighting when I almost crashed into the kid spiderman and his companion at work  This time I was on my way back to my department from bakery deli  which is across the store  as I finished my shopping run and was going to stage what I had and grab another run I reached the end of the frozen section when—pop — a smol spoderman bursted out of one of the frozen isles right in front of my cart He looked at me I looked at him And he looked at me And I looked at him And then he ran off towards the pet isle and took a hard left into them  I kinda just continued my way  walking the same path since my department was in that direction  I took the left and the kid was  Just   standing there  At the other end of the isle  I continued walking trying not to laugh because this kid was just too darn adorable  After I got about halfway down the isle he turned and ran off  After a second I turned the corner and saw this kid turn again  like he was  expecting  me  and dashed off like he was naruto I havent seen this kid since then and I wouldnt be angry if I did  This was the best experience at work Ive had my entire life,1297,245
633,j5yq72,1,62,Dont Stand So Close to Me     no  u  Alright  so about two or three Saturdays ago  I was working a rare morning shift  and it was about an hour before I was due to go home  I was moving the line along until this guy came up to my till  He was a man that looked to be about in his s or s  I was just about to scan his things when he made this noise that sounded like  ANH ANH   I thought he was jerking me around  but when I reached out my hand again to pick up one of his things to scan it  he was about close to losing it  gt  Old man  I said  dont touch that  ILL hold it  and YOU scan it with your scanner gun  Okay  whatever   I thought to myself  But I understood that when there are times like these  its sort of understandable that youd be afraid of catching anything just by picking up something that you dont even trust anyone   not even the person bagging your groceries  Things were going okay until he noticed another customer standing behind him  and thats where he absolutely loses it  gt  Old man  EXCUSE ME  MISS  YOURE SUPPOSED TO STAND SIX FEET AWAY See  this is a lady thats a regular in our store  Shes normally very nice and easy to talk to  but she was ready to lay into him  However  she kept her cool just fine as she said this  gt  Nice lady  Actually  Im standing where Im supposed to be  What are YOU doing Yup   he was actually standing too close to HER as she was standing on the red line on the floor  and had the audacity to accuse her of standing too close to him  And then he made the grand mistake of saying this to her  gt  Old man  Huh  Somebody oughta teach you MILLENIALS about manners  When I say youre standing too close  YOURE STANDING TOO CLOSE Ohhhhh  she BLEW  UP  She looked at him with the meanest sneer on her face and just cussed him out  He ignored her like she was nothing and paid for his stuff  and then managed to forcefully drop his stuff into his bag and left all huffy  I wanted to say something to him so bad  but my manager was right there seeing the whole thing go down  and I didnt wanna barge into the argument between these two customers  After he left  or at least thats what I thought he did  Ill get to that in a minute   I apologized profusely to the woman and we got to talking  She just shook her head and chuckled  gt  Nice lady  Man  this stuffs going arounds bringing out all kinds of crazy people As she said this  we both noticed the old man outside  starting a brand new argument with a couple of people trying to walk inside our store  He was full on screaming at them  and they were shouting back at him before they decided it was no use and made a run for it before he did anything worse  After that  he was seen no more  Main takeaway is  dont accuse someone of standing too close to you when YOU are not standing where youre supposed to be,2869,535
634,j5mnfr,1,31,They moved the item I promise So heres a story of a wild Karen when I worked at a retail farm store  I had just gotten back from my honeymoon and they had rearranged the store  This is important for later  A family walks in the dad and daughter are nice but the mom is a mega Karen  I ask them if they need help finding something and they said they had a coupon for pool salt  I directed them to the back of the store where the salt used to be  I then went back to my checklist of things I had to do  I couldnt necessarily check on them all the time because I couldnt leave the front of the store  The family came back up said they couldnt find it  Complained about it being on the website and not in the store and left  Literally  minutes later the Karen comes back into the store shouting at me  Saying that we had it but it was outside  So I walk outside take a picture of the SKU and head back inside  Upon walking back inside Karen goes off on me saying that was a liar  She got in my face and now its been a while but it went something like this  Karen  You are a lazy worthless employee  You couldnt even be bothered to help us Me  Well you didnt really ask Karen  Yes we did you liar  You just refused  I have it on fucking video  she didnt by the way  you refusing  You wasted our time  Me  Im not allowed to go to the back a follow people around  I have to watch the front Karen  You mother fucking liar  Me  Excuse    Karen   gasp  Who the hell do you think you fucking are to interrupt me like that  You are a fucking waste of space and breath do us all a favor and kill yourself  I am calling your boss and will be getting FIIIRRREEEEDDD   Growling that last part Then she walked out the door flipping me off  I was bawling at the end of this  However   she was in plain view of the security camera when all this happened lol  Nothing ever came of this but I quit  weeks later because my full time job at the school started back up  I wish i had said more but I was shocked and trying to keep it together and be nice to the customer  Looking back I wish I would have fired back at her  However I do know my worth and she was a big reason why I walked away from a company who does not protect their employees from customers like this  The company is so hyper focused on pleasing the customer that their employees get shoved aside  I have tons of stories illustrating this but Ill save them for other subreddits like the time I was asked to cancel my wedding so I could work  Lol,2511,491
636,j5cslb,1,15,Reusable bag exchange This will probably be a really short post but I found it rather ridiculous so I figured I’d post it  I was cashing out this one woman  asked her if she wanted bags and she said no she had her own  Cool  I continued to cash her out  As she was pulling out her bags she noticed one of the straps was broken  She asked if she could trade it in for a reusable bag from our store  even though her broken bag was from a competitor  As if we do that with our own reusable bags   I honestly was so flabbergasted I didn’t know how to react  Pretty sure I may have been slightly rude when I told her no  but seriously  Who asks that  I offered her a plastic bag but she got annoyed  insisted on using her broken bag while also trying to make me feel bad for not giving her a free reusable bag    I didn’t care  finished cashing out her groceries and called the next customer,889,175

643,j3ghj5,1,35,Knife Sharpening  While in my last year of college  I used to work for a very well known outdoor store  Said outdoor store had a knife shop which was a small section of the main store that only sold knives and stuff that went with them  I was covering in the knife shop because we had a guy that worked exclusively back there and he was on break  There were no customers in the shop  and on the display rack was a  in  knife sharpener that was out of the packaging and available to use for anyone  I had a small pocketknife with me to open boxes with during night stocking  so i pulled it out and used the sharpener to sharpen the blade  Out of nowhere I hear “Gimme that damn thing ” I look up startled and a man in his mid ’s plucks the knife and sharpener from my hands and says “you damn kids have no idea how to do anything don’t ya ” He takes my knife and the sharpener and begins to lecture me on how to sharpen the knife properly  All the while his wife is standing next to him  and instead of being mortified by her husband’s behavior  she simply says “he really likes his knives  Knows everything about them ” I’m too shocked to say anything  and he hands me my knife back  much sharper than before  He and his wife leave the little shop to go into the rest of the store  no doubt thinking they had done me a huge favor and taught me a lesson as well,1368,269
644,j3ff8g,1,10,I learned big words and dont know what they mean  Good morning all  On mobile so if there is anything formatting issues let me know Context  I work in the paint department of a hardware store It was a nice slow morning today and I got a call from a gal   May I note this wasnt a Karen and simply someone who didnt know what they were talking about   She is looking for oil based gloss epoxy paint in our Rust o leum brand  Now for those of you who dont know epoxy isnt a paint its a two part compound you combine usually to adhere things together or seal holes  I tell her Ill check then look over what we have and pinpoint enamel paint  I think to myself she might have gotten epoxy and enamel confused so I return to the call Me   Hi again  so I dont have the epoxy you were looking for but I do have clear coat enamel spray paint from that brand will that work  Gal   Well I need epoxy     is it oil based  Me   Yup it sure is Gal   Okay  let me get your name and Ill call back after I talk to the guy  Me   Sure thing my name is  redacted  just ask for me when you call     She hangs up and I look over our shelves to find that we only have one can of this clear gloss spray paint so I set it aside and wait for her to call  After about  mins they page for me to pick up line one and Im certain its the lady hoping she doesnt need too many Me   Hello thank you for holding how can I help you  Gal   Hi again I called earlier about the epoxy paint  I need a gallon and would you be able to set it aside for me to pick up  Me  Unfortunately I only have one spray can of it left and we dont sell it in gallons  May I ask what youre using it for because we may have another product you can use  Gal   Well its for WOOD flooring and we want to put a protective coating over it  Me    Oh well I do have polyurethane thats good for going over bare or stained wood that come in gallons sizes and we do offer oil based its from the Varathane brand would that work  Gal   Let me check   she calls out to someone and talks with them while I wait   Actually that wont work because they said thats for wood and we have outdoor concrete we need to go over   She literally we just telling me it was for wood but now its for concrete   Heck  Me   Well Ive got Drylok brand concrete floor coatings that come in clear that should work  Gal   I picked up something like that from your store not long ago and I was told by the guys that it wont work because its water based and that will mess up the oil based protection coating we have on it already   So she has a protective coating on it already and wants another what the Heck     Me   if you give me just a moment I can check if we have anything oil based thats for concrete  Ill be right back   I check and sadly its all oil based so I return to the call Me   Howdy  thanks for waiting  Unfortunately all of our concrete floor coatings will be water based Gal   Oh shoot well thanks for checking  We really need oil epoxy paint so Ill try checking around some other places  Me   Alright best of luck  Have a good day   click It seemed like whoever told her what they needed either didnt know what they were doing or she misunderstood  She wasnt mean or anything but it was so weird that she couldnt seem to keep her story straight for what she was trying to do or what she needed  I hope she locates what she is looking for or learns the proper names for the items she is trying to find Tldr  Nice lady is looking for an epoxy paint which doesnt exsist and cant seem to stick with what story she has for what its going on  In the end the confused lady decides to search elsewhere,3707,695
645,j3c1ro,1,43,Sir  you have to wait here Back in the s while in college  I worked in a small store of a large nationwide grocery chain part time to help pay for books  extra food snacks  etc  Back then  many grocery stores had video departments  I worked in the non foods department  where we also manned the video counter  the lottery machine  and had a register  couldnt sell anything sold by weight like produce  as there was no scale   You can imagine how busy Saturday nights would get with folks wanting to rent videos and other folks wanting lottery tickets  One such Saturday night in January around    this older gentleman came through with a paper lunch sack  Old man  Here  Heres my money  heres my list  Im going to walk around the store and when I come back I want my lottery tickets  He took off  I looked in the sack  and there was about   in cash  and  pages on lined notebook paper full of   digit lottery numbers  all arranged in different groups whether he wanted them boxed  smaller prize   straight  number order has to be exact  or some other way  I looked at my co worker  who shrugged and began helping the next person in line who wanted to rent a video  Over the next  minutes  I kept entering lottery numbers on the machine just for this one guy  who was no where near the counter  A lady came up and wanted to order lottery tickets as well  and I explained what I was doing and that there was going to be a wait  She became upset  rightfully so   and went to drag a manager over  who told me to stop what I was doing and help the lady in front of me  since the gentleman was not there  So  I did  And the next person  and the next person  because the manager was standing a few feet away  watching me  At    the gentleman returned and was livid because I didnt have his tickets completed  He told me he was going to walk around some more and that I had better have them ready in  minutes when he returned  regardless of the fact that we had  lines  deep  I asked him to stay there  and he refused  Other customers became angry  so I started helping them  The next  told me that guy had some nerve  and that they were going to complain to the manager about him  Next thing I know  the  minutes have passed and the guys list still isnt done  its been over an hour since he brought it to me   He became upset  started yelling at me  saying that I was messing with his money and that if he didnt win because the ticket wasnt finished he was going to sue  He left and dragged a manager back over  its  at this point  and the machine would automatically stop allowing any more tickets to be purchased at that point because the drawings would begin  minutes later   complaining that I didnt finish up his tickets  Mind  this is a different manager than before  and of course  the manager took his side  saying that since he was there first  I should have completed his order before starting on anyone elses  Once the gentleman left  and the line disappeared  the manager pulled me upstairs to the office to give me a talking to  The first manager was up there  and heard the second one telling me I was getting written up  and he interjected  He told the second manager what really happened  and told him that the guy kept leaving and refusing to stay in line so I could work on his list  He also informed him that several other customers had come to him to complain about that guy  and that this wasnt the first time he had done it  and therefore I wasnt to be punished  From then on  it was decided that if the gentleman came back to pull the same stunt  that I and my coworkers had to tell him he either needed to stay right there  or there would be no guarantee his numbers would be input completely and on time  He could also come in on other days of the week to play his numbers for Saturday  Wouldnt you know it  but the next Saturday he shows up at  with another   worth of lists of numbers to play  He tried leaving  and I told him that he needed to stay right there where he was if he wanted those numbers  or he would have to explain to the  other people in line behind him why they couldnt play their numbers as well  He tried to protest  and I offered to get a manager  He backed down and I worked his numbers  This time  the line of customers behind him were mad at him instead of me  and rightfully so    From then on  he started coming in earlier in the afternoon  and stayed there to have a conversation with me while I input his numbers  Ended up being a cool guy  but terribly clueless that others also wanted to play,4616,867
646,j38mfw,1,0,Just   No  Ive worked nearly  years in retail customer service roles  I have several doozies  but heres one that still makes me feel self conscious when Im at my part time job I work at a nationwide grocery store  it has different names  depending on what region of the country   in one of the larger types of stores they have  At the time of this incident  the union contract wouldnt allow non grocery workers to work in the grocery dept  and vice versa  I was covering in the HBA section because they were short on people  and I was facing product  conditioning the shelves  etc  At one point  I was kneeling on the floor  trying to reach the popular lotion that was at the back of the shelf so I could pull it forward when I hear a self satisfied grunt at the other end of the aisle  I look up  and there was this shady looking guy staring at me  He had a slimy grin on his face   So  Youre on your knees  Youre doing a good job over there  Having years of customer service under my belt  I thanked him politely  and he walked away  A few minutes later  I went to another aisle and there he was  also kneeling  examining the shaving cream  I nodded politely and focused on my work   Hey   he said   Were both on our knees  We have something in common  We must both like being on the floor  Hows about I take you out sometime  Trying not to gag  I looked at him   Sir  if you think that is in any way an appropriate way to ask a lady out  Ill have to decline    Aw come on  are you too snooty  I bet youre nasty in bed  I stood up  and walked away  I didnt trust myself to not say anything that would get me fired  was written up years before at a different store for not being polite to a guy who was  just trying to be friendly    I found a store manager  the one guy at the time who took this stuff seriously  to tell him what happened in case a complaint came through  and the manager got upset for me  He asked me if the guy is still in the store  and we looked out the office windows  the office is located upstairs   and the guy was checking out at the registers  Manager looked at me and said if that happened again to report it  because there have been other guys who have tried to prey on  and actually stalked  some of the other gals in the store  and those guys have been banned  That manager has since gone on to a different store  and we have all new  awesome   management that doesnt put up with that kind of nonsense,2467,459

648,j2y2ii,1,8,No  I cant exchange your Destroyed phone To start this off I am a sales rep at a local phone store  Our return policy on all devices only covers software issues that we must be able to replicate  It was a normally slow day at the store  I came in  counted the drawer  updated inventory  and set up my  work station   Laptop  phone charger  and whatever Im reading at the time  in the back when a regular customer comes in  He lets me know his phone wont startup  First of all  it was completely disgusting  covered in dust  some sticky substance  I clean up the phone with  alcohol pads and I went through the troubleshooting processes that I was being recommended from the manufactures to anything our support team or other sales reps could recommend to me  I let me know that since it seems like this issue cant be fixed he might be eligible for a device exchange  I take the case off the phone and it is even more disgusting than I thought  More dust and the case were stuck to the back panel of the phone as if it was glue  I clean it up and give it a decent inspection to see just how the condition of the phone was  It looked fantastic until the dust came off  The entire back of the phone had spiderweb styled cracks on every corner  Afer seeing this I turn to the customer and relay him the situation that is happening in my head  Me  Sir Im sorry but due to the damage on the back of your phone we cannot accept a return or an exchange for the device C  What do you mean  I bought this phone  days ago  Isnt it still in its warranty period Me  Our warranty only covers the software side of the phone  Even though the problem you are having is related to the software we cant accept it due to the damage on the back  C  I know I dropped it a couple of times but I just bought it  cant you talk to a manager or something  Me  One moment  please  I contact the distribution manager and my local store manager though a group chat to see what they think of the situation pictures and all  I made sure all the pictures I took had the brown pads in the back from cleaning the phone beforehand   They were appalled and disgusted that I even ask them about it  They give instant disapproval of the exchange and I let the customer know  Me  Im sorry but I was not able to approve it  would you be interested in getting a new phone today  C  I cant give you any more money  I bought that phone  days ago  cant you give me a credit towards another one or a discount  yes a discount  Ive been a customer for years  Me  If you come into our north location tomorrow you can try again with my manager  Hes the only person who is able to approve any additional credit  discounts  and most importantly a refund or exchange if you truly feel you deserve one  Other than that my hands are currently tied  The customer goes on about how he needs a phone to go to work tomorrow  call his wife and kids  etc  He paces back and forth in our showroom for almost an hour before he finally asks again  I give him the same answer as I have for the past hour  he says some choice words  comes really close to the counter  C  Youre going to regret this laterI was confused so I just say nothing as he storms out the storm  He hits the door with his waist on his way out and knocks a large pocket knife out of his pocket  he picks it up and runs to his car and speeds off almost causing an accident on the nearby intersection  This might have been my wake up call to get out of retail and find a career for myself somewhere else,3551,682

651,j2i2ju,1,95,Customer felt “uncomfortable” because I told her she wasn’t allowed behind the counter So  I work at a fabric store and the other day I had this lady come behind the cut counter  the place we cut fabric for customers   I told her she wasn’t allowed back there and then she was upset and said she was to the side of the counter  Well after that  I cut her fabric and things seemed okay until I cut the last fabric and she told me I made her feel “uncomfortable” earlier  She then went on to tell me that I need to think before I say something lol so then I just told her a apology that it was just the policy  Then she responds by saying she used to work here and she would never treat someone like that lol   after that I just told her “Have a lovely night ” lol  I thought that was gonna be the end of it but she went to find my manager and complained to her about me  Then she made her remeasure the fabric I cut  which was the right measurement btw   Luckily my manager asked for my side of the story and understood where I was coming from but she said that the lady was supposedly a regular  She added that the lady gave some story about how she felt like she was being caught stealing  Idk I was definitely upset about it in the beginning but now I just mostly think it’s weird how deluded she was lol,1310,256
652,j2h3fv,1,52,lady was disgusted with me because we didnt sell motor oil Hello  So I work at a certain red coloured big box store  Basically  today there was this customer who needed help in a totally different department from where I work but nobody was listening to our security dudes walkie requests to help her  so I went over  I went over  and ask if she was doing okay  and she was said  no i am not      and then said  you dont look like you work here  looking me up and down   even though i was in dress code for my work  i was wearing a comfy spiderman shirt and jeans and a name badge of course    I just said  oh Im sorry about that but i do work here  and she said  I guess thats whats acceptable now  and I kinda brushed it off and asked what she needed help finding   and she asked me for motor oil  I responded saying that I had never seen motor oil  but let me look it up on the little device they give us   and started to search for motor oil  She said  Okay  but Ive been waiting a long time for help so Im going to look around  and she went into the next aisle while i searched it on the device   and surprise surprise we didnt sell any motor oil  I went and found her and our exchange went like this   l is for lady  and me is me of course  me  hey  Sorry but it looks like we dont sell motor oil at this location and only other stores will carry this specific type of motor oil  l  What do you mean    Thats ridiculous  How could you not sell motor oil   dont you think thats strange   me  Im sorry about that  but there is a jiffy lube across the street    l  Go away  How dare you say that to me me   starts walking away  alright  have a nice dayl  THIS IS A GROCERY STORE  HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT TO ME  so i just walked away  Still wondering how anything i said was so terrible but oh well,1832,359
653,j2gkng,1,17,Unforeseen Consequences of sanitizing everything all the time So in August  I went to urgent care because my fingers went numb and my hands stopped working   I couldnt hold my phone in my hand for more than  seconds without a weakness developing that I can not describe   Spraying a sanitizer bottle every couple of minutes  every shift  since March destroyed my hands   I am not alone  there are at least  other people working the front end of the grocery store that I am currently employed who have gone to their doctors or urgent care   This is one store  in one of the big grocery chains in North America   This has to be happening all over the place  Repetitive strain from squeezing a sanitizer bottle is the new sitting at a desk all day or smoking or whatever   Have any of you seen or experienced this  I feel like because I do not represent the majority of employees they will happily pay out the claims instead of changing the safety protocols for their employees   I dont know if I CAN USE MY HANDS PROPERLY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE  and nobody in charge seems to be taking it seriously,1103,208
654,j2eo30,1,75,No substitutions I work in a deli for a large supermarket  I make sandwiches   Theres different kinds on normal bread Turkey  ham  beef  etc  Theyre all premade and no special orders  We make these big sub sandwiches too that have ham  Turkey  hard salami and cheese   Well today a lady comes and asks if she can get one without the ham and salami and get beef and turkey and Im pretty sure something else instead   I said no that theres no special orders  shes like  well when do they make them  because maybe you can tell them in the morning when they make them to make one with beef   Im literally making them while talking to her    Im making them right now   well I want one with Turkey and beef   I cant substitute meats   what  I just want beef and Turkey instead of ham and that  salami    Im getting increasingly annoyed   I cant substitute  I have to make them with those meats right so and so    I brought my coworker in because this lady was not getting it   Coworker backed me up and explained that our prices are set based on meats we put on them  beef is more expensive too  shes like  I want one with turkey    I inform her  we have Turkey sandwiches over there   she gestures towards the sub in her hand  we cantdo that    THEN lady tells me  well you should tell them that they should do some with turkey and beef   I go back to what Im doing and ignore her  Im sick of arguing with her over a  dollar sub  go away  I thought FOR SURE  she was going to complain to a manager   my coworker said  let her   It was just one of those moments where I felt like I was going in circles  Now  I probably COULD have substituted and gotten away with it  but those types of people you do it once they expect it all the time AND the one in her hand was reduced  clearance  so she probably expected that price too  I cant stand people,1864,356
655,j2d9ce,1,7,This place is driving me crazy  I got a job at a gas station again  I worked at one in another state for about  and half years and it was all good  This one gas station pays a little more than min wage and its full time  But now I realise the reason why  It is crazy  They only trained me  days and they gave me the busiest shift  It only has gas and most people there are foreigners and I can barely understand the numbers they say so I keep voiding  Or their English is very poor and they think number three is  in English  Then they throw   in ones to put gas on the pump and leave  dont wait for me to verify it  For the past days I have been short and there are aspects of the register that I dont know  But sadly the training was only those  days I dont know why I was short the previous days  I take the money and count it when I give change  make sure they are not stuck  Just a few times  my coworker didnt let me count the drawer when she closed since there was a huge line of customers  I almost had a breakdown yesterday  I did a mistake with the pumps so that led me short again  I work  days and for  hours I am just on the register and getting a lot of  bills  I cant even go on a  minute break  people are knocking the station window or shout for me to come out  I wanted to share on this board  I was happy that I got a full time job but I am on the verge of crying and being terrified of being short everyday,1453,300
656,j1slhd,1,44,Please dont kill the clams  sir  So I work in the deli section of a supermarket chain  This happened a few weeks ago in the fish section  Now at this store  the fish and deli departments have the same workers and are next to each other  The only difference is that only one person is in the fish department at a time     I was helping out customers when a man comes up to me and I get him some stuff out of the case  We keep the shellfish and some other stuff in a refrigerated self in front of it  with the shellfish in buckets of ice to keep them fresh  Im not aloud to give out ice because we dont have any to give and the stuff in the buckets is for keeping the stuff fresh  So of course he asks me for ice  the exchange goes something like this   me  sorry sir but I cant give you ice for  reasons explained above   Customer this time a little ruder   What do you mean  come just give me ice I see some right there point to buckets   me  Im sorry but again I cant give you ice   customer  this is ridiculous I need to go to  town that is like an hour south   you need to give it to me or I will get a manager    We go back and forth for a bit until he takes the clams he had picked up and threw them into the bucket  I go and check only to find they are cracked  So  at the point  Im hoping he comes back so I can get him to pay for them    And what do you know  He comes back with a grocery manager who doesnt know how things work in the deli  I explain the situation to him and he understands that Im just doing what Im supposed to   I also make sure to mention the broken clams  He just tells the guy if he wants ice that he will need to buy a bag from the store  which is like  cents  and that he will need to take the broken ones  The buy argues with him for a bit and then finally relents and goes to pay    My manger gets back from break  so I tell him what happened and we all had a good laugh about it   As I thought I didnt get in trouble since we pretty much get people like that all day  On the way home I told my brother about it and turns out he went through his line  He of course complained about how we were being ridiculous about ice and all that   I wonder how he would have reacted to him had he know he was my brother,2281,478

659,j1ilck,1,35,Old bizarre story I haven’t been in retail for more than  years but I was recently reminded of one of the more bizarre interactions I when I worked part time at a furniture store  It was the late s and I was working part time in a furniture store on the weekends during college  One day I get a call from a lady who had special ordered a bedroom set  months ago  At the time she was told the order would take  months and wanted to know whether we had her furniture in yet  No problem  I asked for her receipt invoice number but the system didn’t have a record of her order  I asked for her name but the system didn’t have a record of her either  She gets irate  Tells me she has the receipt in her hands and berates me for not understanding simple numbers and how to spell  She finally tells me she wants a full refund and that she’s coming in person to make sure she gets her money back  mins later the woman shows up  She asks for the person she spoke to on the phone and when I come out to help her she yells at me for being incompetent  I’ve got a thick skin and at this point I’m really curious to see what the problem is  so I ask to see her receipt  I look at it and immediately see the problem  she’s at the wrong store  We don’t have a record of her order because she didn’t buy anything from our store  I point this out to her but she refuses to believe me  She’s convinced the store  and me in particular  are trying to steal her money  I point out that the store name on her receipt and the name in front of the store she’s current at isn’t the same  the receipt we issue don’t look anything like hers  and the phone numbers don’t match  She says it’s been  months and we could have gotten new receipts and made changes  The phone number in her receipt doesn’t work anymore and she found our store in the phone book  She trusts the phone book to be right Finally  I ask her to read the address on her receipt and walk her outside to show her the street sign to prove to her we’re not at the same location  Our store wasn’t part of a chain  it only has a single location  I tell her maybe she should got to the address shown on her receipt and get her refund there  Showing her the public street sign finally clicked something in her mind and she stormed off  got in her car  and left  Didn’t apologize or say a word  I later found out the store on the receipt had gone out of business a few months earlier,2439,477

666,j0nq2g,1,93,Um   you are in the wrong store This has happened so many times during my years in retail  that if I had a dollar for every time it happened  I wouldnt have to work in retail anymore  What I am  of course  referring to  is when a customer comes into your store  says a product is on special  and then eventually realises that it is on special elsewhere  or it was on special last week I block a lot of these out these days  but looking at an old facebook memory today  I got reminded of one of my earliest  and a classic  situation like this Back at the turn of the century  I worked for one of the two major supermarkets chains in this country  lets call them Colds  The location I worked at  was what I would call supermarket central   if you had a supermarket chain  you had a location within  kilometre distance  There were about  or  supermarkets within a   kilometre radius of our location  and just within the immediate vicinity  there were all four major chains  the two majors  a third major that was about to go bust  and a fourth which is independently owned franchises  all within walking distance  So it was common for people to start to get confused with what supermarket they were in I was working the checkouts this one day  when the customer  lets call him Mr C  comes in  I am there  scanning his items  when he notices a discrepancy with the price of an item Mr C  Excuse me  the price of that ice cream is wrong Me  How so Mr C  Well  you have charged me     yet it is on special for   Me  Let me just check on that   where did you see it advertised on special Mr C  It was in your catalog Me  Ok  let me just have a look I then browse the catalog  and find no mention of the ice cream being on special Me  Im sorry sir  but it is not in the catalog Mr C  Yes it is Me  Sorry sir  but I have just looked through the entire catalog  and it is not in here Mr C  Give that to me Mr C grabs the catalog out of my of hands  and then proceeds to look through it  He then looks through it a second time  and then throws it down Mr C  This is the wrong catalog  Why have you shown me the wrong catalog  I want to speak to a supervisor Me  Excuse me sir  but this is the correct catalog  If you have a look at the front page of the catalog  you will see the dates that the specials are on for Mr C  Dont give me any of this nonsense  Leave all my stuff here  Im going home to get the catalog that YOU guys put in MY mailbox  to show YOU what the specials are Me  Ok sir Mr C left  and I did a deferred sale  even though I was not expecting him to come back  Amazingly   minutes later  he did  And he came straight to my checkout  trying to interrupt my sale Mr C  See  I told you Me  Excuse me sir  do you mind waiting while I serve this customer Mr C  No   you pay attention to me  and now Me   to the customer on my checkout  Ill just be a second   To Mr C  Fine  show me Mr C proceeds to open the catalog  straight to where the ice cream is on special  But I had already noticed three things wrong with it  so was going to bring each of them up  one at a time Me  Firstly  sir  the ice cream that is on special  may be the same brand that you are trying to purchase  but it is the wrong size Mr C  What do you mean Me  Well  the one you are trying to purchase is a  litre tub of ice cream  The one on special is the  litre tub Mr C  I dont care   still give me the special Me  Well  if I was to still give you the special  it would be the same sort of special as there is off the  litre tub   which would mean that you would actually be paying MORE Mr C  This is just flagrant misadvertising Me  Secondly  look at the dates of the specials   this was LAST WEEKS catalog Mr C  I didnt know of the special last week   you should keep them running for longer Me  And finally  I would like you to look at the store sign above you Mr C  Ok  and   Me  And now look at the logo on the front of the catalog Mr C  And   Me  Now compare the two   are they the same Mr C  Um   Mr C at this point became very quiet  and quickly scurried out of there,4157,774

670,izv34m,1,27,Department Store Hell I work in a department store that always has sales on almost everything in the store  On this particular day   days ago  my shift was manning the registers by myself from open to close  Customers were getting mad over every little thing  They had to wait in line  some read sale signs wrong and threw a big fit  one lady started screaming because her order pickup wasnt ready even though she didnt get the email confirmation  and there were several complicated returns  Mind you  this was my fourth day working at the store  To say in the least  I was absolutely done  The real fun started when a guy in his mid s came to the register  He had one Adidas hoodie and two Nike golf shirts  I started ringing him up and the total came out to around    He immediately jumped on me saying that the total should be    I do a price check and mens athletics were BOGO   off  so my calculations were correct  He would not take no for an answer  I tried explaining  and doing the math for him several times  but he insisted that I was wrong  After about  minutes he finally said   Forget it  Youre machine is saying a different price than the sign   and promptly left  No  sir  The register is right  your brain is not  It finally dawned on me that he thought BOGO meant that he would buy only one item and get it   off  In conclusion  I think retail has finally broke me,1413,263

680,iw6g3b,1,99,Can I mix deadly Chemicals  No  Ill rub oranges on it  On mobile so sorry for formatting  I work at a hardware store for context A middle aged woman approached me today while I was in our paint department and began asking about what we have to remove rust from her outdoor metal chairs  Ive got just the thing to do it fast so I take her to our naval jelly and explain to her how you would apply it onto the rusted areas and then wash it off after  mins blah blah blah  The lady tells me how she doesnt like the idea of rinsing it off Cus then it will go into the water  She then asks if she can use it to remove paint as well and I let her know that its formulated specifically for rust so she would need to use something like a paint remover  I show her the paint removers we have and she says she doesnt want to use them because the chemicals are too strong  Her  Well do you have anything environmentally friendly that I can use Me  Sure  We have this item which is made from naturally occurring acids in oranges as well as other naturally sourced additives  Its should peel up the paint after you allow it to sit them youll take a putty knife and scrape it off Her  Well can I just scrape the old paint and rust off instead of using the chemicals because I dont want to use them Me  For the paint you could try to just scrape it off and the rust could probably be sanded down to the bare metal but thats a lot more work Her  Well what does bare metal look like Cus Ive already tried sanding it off Me  Depending on what kind of metal it is it could be a light or dark silver color and it probably will look rather dull  Her  oh okay and is there a tool I can use to scape it off Me  you could use a putty knife or sand paper Her  no I mean like a power tool Me  Well they have sanders that are in power tool variants Her  oh I dont want to sand it though  Are you sure there isnt anything else to remove the rust thats safer so I wont have to rinse it off Me  For the tight spaces that you cant sand or scrape down to bare metal youll probably need to use something like this naval jelly to break down the rust Her  Oh  well I just really dont want to rinse it off Cus then it will get in the water that will be recycled and cleaned then we will be drinking it and I dont want children drinking that  Me  I know it really sucks but other than this youd have to look online for home remedies to remove it Her  Well I tried that and used vinegar but it didnt clean it and I just cant find anything that works  Do you think if I mix this naval jelly with the citrus paint stripper that I could use them and it would make the naval jelly less toxic Me  No mama and youll definitely not want to mix any of these cleaning products as it could cause a chemical reaction Her  But the citrus one is organic it should be fine Me  Even though its sourced from more natural items like oranges it still has enough chemicals to peel off paint and mixing that with naval jelly could be very dangerous Her  Oh okay    well maybe if I just buy oranges and rub them on the chair it will get the paint off  Im just gonna keep looking Me  okay have a good night and good luck with your project She then stood there for about  more minutes before consulting another employee and leaving afterwards with the naval jelly and the citrus cleaner  I really hope she didnt bring them home and mixing them up expecting one to cancel out the chemicals in the other  Sometimes Im in awe of how customers think  Sorry if this was boring I just thought this was so absurd I needed to share Tldr  Woman wants a non toxic way to remove old paint and rust  Doesnt like how our product has chemicals and needs to be rinsed off  Thinks that maybe if she rubs oranges on her chair it will magically be clean then asks if she can mix one of our non toxic cleaners with a stronger one to cancel out the toxicity  Is told no then after thinking it over she leave with the recommended items,4034,765

682,ivqf9z,1,126,Some cant take a joke  some own it  This is a story from a few years ago  but I just found this subreddit and it reminded me I was a cashier at a local supermarket  and we have a law that if alcohol is being bought and the cashier estimates someone to be under   they have to ask for ID  While it offends some people  it is a pretty good way to get to check an ID and see if someone is over   the legal age to buy alcohol  No ID is also no alcohol I decided to have sone fun with it  and whenever I estimated someone to be over   I would also ask them for an ID  Usually this got a laugh  sometimes it got people offended  once a lady even called for a manager  who had to come to clarify to her that it was a joke  You know the type   However  one man ruled the joke  He was just buying a few beers  and I asked him for his ID because he looked way into his s  He laughed  grabbed his wallet  and handed me a card in a plastic casing  Still with a huge smile on his face  he asked me  Do you know what that is  It looked sort of like an ID  but I had never seen anything like that one   What I could tell was that it was old and something from the military  He said   What you are holding now is my military ID from the second world war  Is that a valid ID here  Because I no longer have my drivers licence  It was at that point that I was at a loss for words  This man took my joke  handed it back and won,1433,294
683,ivptcx,1,4,Customer is always right   pardon  Okay  tell me who in the world came up with this phrase and who actually believes that  Because everyone who worked in a retail would question that I work at an online retailing  Most of my inquiries are online  so at least I dont have to communicate with anyone face to face  Ive had my own share of every single kind of people  Nice and just generally sweet  people who appear just once in a blue moon with interesting questions  and then disappear   people who dont question you any questions and just buy and are happy with their purchases and then     nightmare ish Karens who appear during the full moon or before one when it is quickly approaching My story consists of a Karen  I sell clothing  and they   of the time are brand new  with tags  although I do mention if the clothing dont have tags and or the customer has to be aware of something  They are original on the cheap prices especially if they have not been bought for months and they are just dusting at this rate  so sometimes you have to make discount just to sell them  Its okay I was contacted by a Karen who bought a pair of boyfriend jeans  Alright  And today she arrives with a message asking me if those are male jeans   I told her no but I also explained her the model and that boyfriend jeans is just inspired by male jeans  Makes sense  cue the name  right  I thought this will be the end for me  Haha  you know I wish it was  There is an inside tag where you can check the model in the internet for yourself  too  I also explained it to her and said that she can compare it to what she sees in the pictures  as in to help her out   This was only the pair of jeans of that model that I was selling and I dont remember the code nor the model name  We dont write these things down Before she starts attacking me  saying that there is a defect and that jeans shouldnt look like that  because she had other jeans of this model  yet the moments ago she was accusing me that those are men jeans    I told her to send me the pictures of a defect   Did she send me one  No  I am still waiting  She attacked me with a hunch of messages right away and now that I have requested her to send me the proof   she is awfully silent I will probably keep updating OP as the story revolves  So far waiting for the pictures You know  what pisses me off the most  Is that you always have to be tactful and nice with them  But they are losing it with an each passing message and you can see how offensive they become  Yet you have to try and be opposite of them because this is what its required of you  It did ruin my mood  I wont lie  Karens are especially talented at destroying your mood,2716,514
684,iv9r4y,1,27,Customer Wants A Outlet With A Light That Last’s Forever  I just thought of this one time a few month ago where I had a customer with one of those electrical outlets the have that dim glow from a built in LED  Told me she bought it a while ago  but the light has gone out  and wanted a new bulb to replace it  I told her the outlet still works  so she can still use it normally  but she didn’t want to use it without a working light  I told her they don’t make new lights for those outlets because they are built in  so she’d have to buy a new outlet  I take her down and show her the options  She then says something that kinda flabbergasted me  She said “And the lights in these are guaranteed to work forever right ” I told her no  they will burn out eventually  She says “Well  I want something that lasts forever ” I told her that was not possible  and she asked me why not  I explained that everything goes through wear and tear  The lights in the outlets are no exception  I said to her you could get months out of these lights  or quite a few years  But eventually they will give out  and the light will burn out  She wasn’t to thrilled by my answer  and reluctantly took a new outlet  I just laughed after she left  Anyone knows all things wear out and give out eventually  It’s not a question of if  it’s always when,1335,258

690,iuq4ng,1,3,Hurricane season Since we’re waiting for a storm to hit it reminded me of this story my mom told me  My parents went through hurricane Andrew in the s in Miami and my mom worked at a large grocery chain  They decided that a manager from every store had to stay IN THE STORE during the storm  For her store the manager they chose they told him it was because “he was young and didn’t have a family” so they were literally willing to sacrifice his life for product  The entire front of the store was glass and he was on the phone with another manager when it blew in   Underground telephone lines  He told the other manager he had to go because the storm was now inside the store  They left that man to die there  She said he was beyond traumatized when they came the next day and he was just kind of sitting in what was left of the store  He didn’t even have a flashlight because all hurricane supplies had been sold  I can’t even imagine how much that lawsuit would be if there was even a WHISPER of that happening now  That’s honestly one of the worst things I’ve ever heard a corporation doing to workers at least in the modern age  If there’s a better place for this let me know and I’ll move it there,1207,232
691,iungx7,1,12,The Curse of the  Item on Hold  So  youre a sales clerk working on commission  Thats respectable  Admirable  even  Lord knows it takes hustle to earn that paycheck  more power to you  Youre a powerhouse But wait  whats this  Ah  a customer approaches  But not just any customer  Well    technically not yet even a customer  Theyve got something in their arms  but they dont want it now  they need to think about it  They need to ask their mother for an opinion  They left their wallet in the car  Theyd like to shop the rest of the mall first and then return to you at the end of the day  dont worry  though  they parked in the ramp connected to your store  so theyre guaranteed to swing through again   What do you do  Youre technically not allowed to put items on hold   against company policy  they say  Everyone does it  though  even the managers that make that claim  Exceptions are made for clients you know    or have a good feeling about  Plus  this person seems so excited about the item  Surely  holding it for them this time would be fine  Especially if you let them know that youre technically not supposed to do holds  but youll make an exception for them  The gratitude  You can see it on their faces  plain as day  They feel special  Important They go about their business  and you tuck it away and mark it as ON HOLD  You feel good  You feel positive  Youve finally made a sale today  in the future though it may be   and the ever present stress of  sellsellsell  eases off of your shoulders just slightly  You breathe  Unbeknownst to you  someone slips through your department during the minute youre in the back  on a mission for this exact item  They dont find it  and leave  dejected You re emerge onto the floor  a renewed confidence in your step  No one else asks you to put anything else on hold  Better than that   you make some sales  Something your eyes unavoidably miss  though   the coworker working order fulfillment in the back  searching for the very item youve put on hold  On their screen  it shows that your store has only one in stock  and  neither able to find it on the floor nor in the back  theyre forced to reject the request  This person has already paid for the item through online ordering  but alas  if its not there then its not there  Theyll get their refund if no other stores end up having it in stock  either An hour passes  and then two  Your shift is nearing its end  and the sun has long since set  The store itself is subtly shifting into end of the day mode  and you begin to have doubts  Another hour passes  The store begins to close  A personal stylist swans their way up to your cashwrap  asking if youve seen a specific item  Well  yes  actually  Its the one youd put on hold  They glide into the back after it and then whisk it away  destining it to a fitting room for tomorrow where it will accessorize a curve fitting Max Mara suit and sleek Manolo Blahnik heels  Its just as well  you think  Shell be the one most likely to make the sale  anyway  True enough  you never see the customer from earlier again The next day  a repeat with subtle changes  Another customer  except this time shell be back in ten minutes  You kindly and regretfully inform her that youre not allowed to put anything on hold  Shes taken aback  Shes a regular customer  she tells you  and shes put things on hold here before  Recently  even  You fully believe this and delicately explain that the policies have changed  You apologize profusely for it  She is very startled by this newfound knowledge  She buys her   hairclips  of which we have over a dozen  and are at no risk of selling out of in ten minutes   and then leaves The next day  a repeat with more significant changes  Someone wants to buy one of the few designer pieces you have in your department   a Burberry  specifically  More than that  actually  a thick  heavy Burberry cape that is  in your store  one of a kind  Its priced at over     it alone will max out your sales numbers for the day  and    you succumb once again  agreeing to put it on hold  This woman is waiting for feedback from a friend  Its an investment  and she needs a second opinion  Understandable Surprisingly  she  does  come back later  Even more surprising  Shes in  She wants it  One snag  though  You freeze  dread and resignation rising in equal measure  and immediately stop the transaction  A literal snag  going straight up the back a solid six inches  You point it out to the customer  and her jaw drops  She is  incredibly  grateful to you for spotting this  An idea does occur to you  though  You have an amazing alterations department  You cant make any promises  but they frequently work miracles and its possible that theyd be able to fix the snag  Spoiler  They are  and they do  She comes back an hour later and  imperfections vanished  she buys it You’re floating for the rest of the day  from both the praise your service received and the reprieve from the   SELLSELLSELL        that’s scorched into the deepest recesses of your mind  Thats never been your focus  youve never cared about the numbers  and my god this is a relief Two days later  a coworker from a neighboring department sheepishly walks over  shes your friend  and youd told her about your dramatic sale   It turns out that someone had come over to do a return with her just minutes before and she  of course  was tasked with bringing the item back to its correct department  She hands you your beautifully mended Burberry cape  Your heart sinks You dont put things on hold anymore,5612,983

698,it1jhg,1,19,A customer gets upset with me for spelling her name wrong  When I was working for a retail store  we had a system where if you were a rewards member  you could type in your phone number and have us type in your name for you on your receipt  this does serve a purpose but I dont want to get into that because that would disclose my workplace    Well  this one older lady and her younger  but still older  friend comes to my register   The younger older friend tells me that she told her older friend about this fantastic sale we were having on a certain item I ring up the older lady for her item and she has a rewards account so she types in her phone number and asks to personalize it with her name  again  cant mention the details without giving myself away    You see  Im hard of hearing and after fruitless attempts from both women to spell it out  I ask the older woman to write her name   I go to type it in and  by accident  got one letter wrong because it looked like another letter  and it sounded like it  too    The receipt prints out and Older Woman looks at it and scowls    Well  crap  Older Woman was upset that I had spelled her name wrong   I tried in vain to tell her that one letter looked like the other and apologized but she didnt have any of it   She was upset that I got it wrong despite her writing it out and looked at me like I was an idiot   I looked to her younger older friend who told me not to worry about it   I offer the Older Woman her receipt and she just snatches it out of my hand and slightly storms out of the store with her friend behind her,1591,316

700,isutus,1,37,Oh  you didnt need to bring me flowers  Yall ready for a wholesome story for once This happened half a year or so ago when I was working on a little tobacco store  It was pretty laid back as we were allowed to have an attitude with rude customers  We were the only one who sold cigarettes in a mayor train station so wed always have enough customers  But no one was allowed to be rude to regulars  EVER  Most of the regulars were really nice and since I worked the registers most of the time I got to know all of them a little bit  Especially this one mechanic who always got his Pall Mall Red every day at the same time between trains  Now  wed always crack jokes with people and keep it laid back  My favourite joke was when a customer happens to carry flowers and came to the register Id say  Oh  you didnt need to bring me flowers   Most people laughed and we carried on like normal  maybe a bit happier  So one day the mechanic comes in carrying a dozen white roses wrapped really beautifully in gift paper  I give my usual line of  You didnt need to bring me flowers  and he was like  Yes I do  its your birthday today right  These are actually for you  MY REGULAR REMEMBERED MY BIRTHDAY THAT I MAYBE TOLD HIM ONCE  This was so touching and what I like about retail  You build a good connection with your regulars and get to know random people your otherwise wouldnt know Hope you enjoy,1425,263

704,iseybg,1,40,So much for calling in sick to avoid customers  All the context needed here is that I work as a Store Manager at a phone retailer and I called in sick today  Suddenly  my phone rings  I dont have any friends so I immediately know its my rep calling for some help   usually his questions are quick and easy or he needs a Spanish translation for a customer  He apologizes for bothering me but hes having trouble with a language barrier  No big deal  or so I thought  put them on the phone  I spent the next  minutes or so going back and forth with the customer telling me every single variation of the same thing  Digging in their account revealed they had a family plan with us and that her son had recently taken his line to another provider  Without going into boring detail  basically no matter what phone provider you are with in the US  with the exception of Prepaid providers   when you sign a contract for a phone  the most important line is that  If you leave the provider  they will charge the remaining balance of the contracted phone to your bill  in one lump sum   The customer refused to listen to me when I told her that she broke the contract by taking the line somewhere else  Everytime I tried a different phrasing to explain to her she just came making up excuses refusing to take responsibility  even saying this was my companies fault for not bringing back the line when she asked customer service to do so  At this point I had run out of ways of asking why she left in the first place  reiterating that if she leaves its not our problem and I told her flat out  this cannot be solved in store  go talk to the other provider  they still have the line in question  then talk to customer service  Before I could say anything else  she told me  I can tell youre Puerto Rican as well  and im not here to argue with you  As I was about to answer she hung up on me herself  I was beyond annoyed and just happy I didnt have to talk to her anymore  I know Puerto Ricans are stubborn but JFC its not that hard to understand you have to take responsibility for your actions  Sorry for the long post  after this my Sunday was soured so I just felt like I needed to rant a bit,2202,417

707,is4nbf,1,31,Everyone shut up the Prophet has arrived Obligatory not my story disclaimer  This is from my sister’s job from about a year ago  I’m gonna write in first person for the sake of avoiding unnecessary verbosity This was about a year ago in the summer and I was working a long shift  I work at a store that rents and sells tuxedos and suits for prom  weddings  etc   Anything you need a suit for we can do it   This was an out of the ordinary occurrence  I was helping out a couple with their wedding colors  a wedding that would round out to be a couple thousand dollars in suits  when a mysterious fellow walked in  He announced to my store  “I am the Prophet Eric TheCrazyMan Taylor ”  Fake name  but I promise the real one was just as strange   “And God has sent a message to me ” The only other person working with me was new and has only been in the store for two weeks so I had her take over the wedding and went to help the Prophet  I knew this would be above her pay grade  Me  What can I do for you sir The Prophet  God has sent me a message  that I need a suit and a celebration to mark the end of my fast  Me  We can do that for you sir  Any specific styles or colors you have in mind Queue some on script chit chat and insane responses from the Prophet and I get his ideas  A white tuxedo with tails and a top hat  Now  we don’t sell top hats  The best we have are the small top hats that we give to toddlers to be ring bearers  Furthermore we don’t stock tails  We would need to special order from our plant to make that happen  I order everything in  I get him out of my store  He comes in a week later to try everything on and do alterations  The next week comes  I’m helping the new trainee with ringing out a Quinceañera when he arrives once more  His standard greeting  of course “I am the Prophet Eric TheCrazyMan Taylor ” Now  this man is dressed to the  nines   He’s in a bright green coat that brushes the floor  he has dreadlocks wrapped around his head  and a tall wooden staff with green  I can only assume fake  gems  I’m giving you more details than you need because you have to believe this was really a real man I encountered in the st century in an upscale formalwear setting  He tries on his stuff  looks dapper in his tails  and requests his top hat  I tell him we can only give him a small toddler sized hat and he seems pleased  He puts it on  and wraps his dreadlocks around it to keep it in place  He is a sight to be seen  Everything seems to his liking and he takes it off  but arrives out of the dressing room with his hat still on  I request it back so I can ring him out and he takes it off  His dreadlock falls on the floor  He doesn’t notice  I ring him out but he can’t pay  After a long hour of him calling around he finds a woman from his church  cult   to front the bill  After all  it is a divine god mandated expense  The bill comes to over   and the woman tells me her card details happily over the phone  stating “Not as much as I expected ” What  You expected this  He leaves with his things  and his dreadlock is still on the floor  Trainee looks at me in confusion and asks “Do we    throw it away ” I nod silently and she puts on gloves  picks it up  and tosses it in the garbage in the back  Other customers in the store are really starting to get a kick out of this  Just one more step  returns He doesn’t  He doesn’t return his things for over five weeks  racking up a   late fee  all charged to the church woman’s card  She calls and asks me why these charges are appearing and I told her this was the card on file for the Prophet  She hangs up crying  The Prophet returns in three more days  He calls his bank to transfer the charges to his own card  luckily  and puts his card on file for me  The bank has to call me to confirm everything and while that’s happening the Prophet informs me he’s missing his sermon  I tell him I can’t go any faster  so  like a sane human being  he calls his church  In the middle of my store with customers being fitted and spoken to he calls the church  and gives a sermon over the phone in complete gibberish  Passionately  Loudly  I couldn’t believe it  I didn’t know what to do so I just went to help other people but I could hear it no matter where I went  Customers are laughing and I’m apologizing profusely but they’re in complete awe of this character  This hero of a man  Finally  after thirty minutes he hangs up and passes the sermon over to what I can only assume is another pastor  but who knows  The card is accepted  the charges go through  He finally leaves I clock out early,4637,885

719,iq9hwz,1,2,Scanner Cancer  Standard on mobile disclaimer So this particular customer was    interesting to say the least She comes up with a fully loaded cart  easily   worth of items and most are    Before I can even pick up the first item  she tells me that I have to type in the SKU number for every item  and I cant scan them because her doctor told her the radiation would give her cancer I explained to that it isnt a laser  its just a light  I made up the fact that the plastic lens blocks ionising radiation  I told her that even if it was a laser the radiation they emit isnt harmful ionising radiation and it would only be a ridiculously low amount  and of course  it isnt a laser  just a red light  On top of which  the items are mostly in boxea  and paper doesnt hold ionising radiation  That she was absorbing more radiation from the sun and the florescent lights  That if she was really that sensitive she would have gotten cancer while walking to the store,982,177
720,iq8vct,1,1,One smokey afternoon A few years ago we were experiencing some nearby forest fire smoke in the atmosphere in town  Things were rather red  smokey  dramatic looking   you get it  I was working at an upscale kitchen store at the time and our customers ran the gamut from colourful  out of touch  to the downright mean  rude Tiffany clad reptiles   On this smokey day a customer comes in and they are at the til paying for their trinkets  A discussion about the wildfires is happening nearby as its pretty darn noticeable  She pivots to this conversation   an opportunity  They moan about the air quality and the lack of visibility together  We finish our transaction at the til and before she leaves she is wrapping up her air quality critique by directing at me  Its awful  I dont know how YOU PEOPLE put up with it  And she leaves Now  a  you people  should always be used thoughtfully  or not at all   but Ive always wondered what she meant  Did she think I started the fire  Or some other young urbanite set to ruin her week at the cabin I thought about her today  I hope shes happy choking down whatever air those people have subjected her to without complaint,1180,207
721,iq4uol,1,17,Thrown under the bus for saying “She throws us under the bus ” This was years ago  as I was working at a fabric craft store  We were pretty busy that day and it was one of those times that you would be darned if you did darned if you didn’t leave your post and go up to help at the register  Both lines were uncontrollable  We were short handed for some reason  My manager back then was  well to put it nicely  extremely out of shape  She’s one of those  how in the world did this woman get to be manager types  Lazy and stupid to top it off  There were two Karens who were together to return something and complain to the manager  Nothing better than a Karen who has a wingman right   I would go up and ring someone and go back to the counter and was trying to balance the lines  There was only maybe  or  of us all together on the floor  not enough of us to get rid of the lines and the manager  the only key holder  was holed up in the back  I called and called again  Kept calling over and over and she just wouldn’t come out of the office  Finally the Karens were like “Is there a manager who can help us   We have been waiting and waiting and you guys won’t help us  ” I walked by them and with my voice cracking said “I have called her like seven times  I’m trying to get her out here but she won’t come out of the office  She throws us under the bus all the time ” Which she did  She was ALWAYS just sitting in the office because she was so out of shape  It was like pulling teeth getting her to come up to the registers and I was done with it that day  As I was clocking out for the day back in the office  she was telling me and another coworker about the Karens  how awful they were and she goes “they told me that you said I throw you guys under the bus  can you believe that  ” I froze  trying not to have my eyes as big as silver dollars  Her back was to me  My coworker said “I can’t believe that  That doesn’t sound ANYTHING you would ever say ” I made a snap decision to roll with it  “Pshh  Yeah  That’s weird  Unbelievable ” It was a perfect opportunity to make Karens sound like Karens  I was in the clear  They threw ME under the bus  I was trying my best to get the manager out there and they ratted me out  It was one of the only times in my life where I had to make a snap decision to bluff lol,2331,466
722,iq4osw,1,31,Customer’s child makes my day This was a story that happened to me a while ago but I’ve decided I feel like sharing it today A couple of years ago I was working the customer service desk at a grocery store  Our store sells lottery tickets at the service desk  and as I’m sure most people who have dealt with them know  people can be very picky about their lottery tickets  Well one day a woman who looks to be in her mid late s comes up with her child who was probably only   years old max  She asks me for two Mega Millions tickets  So I get them for her and the exchange went as follows Me  Here are your  Mega Millions Customer  I asked for  Poweball Me  Uhm  I’m sorry miss but you definitely asked for Mega Millions Customer  I know what I said  I said I wanted two Powerball Kid  No Mommy you said Mega Millions Customer   looks at child then back to me  Oh  I did Me  Yes  but I can still get you two powerball if you like Customer  No that’s okay  I’ll just take the Mega Millions She then pays and they leave  but everyone I told about it that day got a kick out of it  Wherever you are kid  thanks for looking out,1150,213
723,iq0a8e,1,21,Almost made a TalesFromTheCustomer story by seemingly being disrespectful Few years ago  but Im having a bad day so I wanted to recount this silly story  I was working in Electronics at the real world version of Dane Cooks Super Club  This middle aged guy came up to me to talk about laptops  a very typical exchange He gives me enough information to know which laptop he wants  its just not on sale  Never buy a laptop from Super Club not on sale  because Newegg Amazon will have better for cheaper  So I pull out my phone mid statement  The convo went like so Me  Yeah I definitely think this one will work for you  slightly under my breath  but I dont like that price  let me see here  Proceed to check online if its on sale here but online  or if Newegg Amazon does indeed have cheaper Man  You think this one will work huh  Well I think  uh   He pauses here and I didnt really know why until he continued Man  I see  Well  thank you for your time This gets me to look up as Im not expecting such a turn  As he starts to walk away I realize whats happening Me  Wait  Wait  Im sorry I should have explained  Im looking this up to see if this is online for cheaper I turn my phone to show him before he starts to laugh  then we both share a chuckle as he explains he thought I just lost interest during the conversation  I still feel bad that I made him think this way and Im glad I showed him it was my mistake,1443,263
724,ipsoxv,1,32,Why isn’t the internet working   I topped up yesterday   So I work in a telco retail store  We have to deal with technologically challenged people all the time  obviously tech isn’t everyone’s forte which is fine  But patience and learning is always something you would assume someone is capable of  Anyway  I had this elderly gentleman come into the store for probably the third time this week  He has a pre payed plan which he tops up every month and every time he comes in he asks about his internet on his phone  in which we assure he has because it’s provided within his plan  But today he came in pretty pissed off  “here we go again” I think to myself  He’s complaining that we are taking his money and ripping him off  “why is there no internet  ” He says  I check his account and his plan is active and working  there’s heaps of data available  So I grab his phone and have a look  Not to my surprise  his Mobile Data isn’t even switched on   So this is time where my patience has worn thin and my stern grown up voice is switched on  To his defence he is a foreign older dude who struggles with English  but how can you use a smart phone  know how to txt call  use what’s app and then not know how to turn the Data on  Even when I went to show him make him turn it on he was arguing the fact that he isn’t good with tech  I just had to tell him that it doesn’t matter  I will show you and then you will know  The problem was fixed in a matter of a swipe and a click  I just hope he retains the information I provided and doesn’t come back in to endlessly grizzle about technology  It just becomes frustrating where you have a stubborn customer not willing to even listen and learn,1701,320

731,io1ki1,1,26,Woman tries to get a refund on a defective product  was using the wrong charger  So this happened today  which is the last day of my work week so that sucks TL Dr Karen brings in wrong charger for her device  blows up when it needs testing just to be shown that shes been using the wrong charger the whole time I had a lady call up first thing in the morning asking for a refund for a product that hasnt worked since the day she bought it which was  weeks ago Company policy is if an electrical appliance isnt working  weeks after purchase  it needs to be assessed to ensure its being used correctly  Had karen dealt with this when she realised the product was malfunctioning  it would have taken half a second  but alas  for some reason  she left it I explained the policy over the phone and she started ranting about Fair trading and consumer law  I explained that she was welcome to drop in  have an assessment done while she waited or did other shopping  Nope not good enough She said she was going to speak to consume affairs and hung up She comes in to the store a few hours later  says Fair trading took her side and shell be receiving her refund  I say   nope  Im checking the machine first  thats when I find the wrong charger piled up with the rest of the stuff   Sorry maam  this is the wrong charger  have you been using this charger the whole time or do you have other rechargeable devices plug in to the same area    I offer to plug her machine in to the charger of our display unit to check if using the correct charger will fix it Karen goes nuclear  demands I call the person dealing with her complaint at fair trading so I do after getting her machine on the correct charger  and I explain to fair trading that the machine has been brought in with the wrong charger and if this is the charger being used the whole time  that would be why the machine isnt working  thus no refund  I offer to plug her machine in to the charger of our display unit to check if using the correct charger will fix itBy the end of the phone call the machine has charged enough to run for longer than Karen has ever had it run  showing that the correct charger  which should be somewhere in her home  will make the machine charge normally I wish the story had a happy ending but because Karen was causing such a scene  manager stepped in and did the refund anyway just to get rid of her  but it was a joy to have fair trading go from being on Karens side to on the companys side,2508,467

733,ino4p2,1,28,That’s not how this works lady A few years ago I had this lady come in asking about her layaway  She asked me if she wanted only a few pieces out of her layaway if she had to get the whole layaway out or if she could just get those few pieces  I told her it was all or none of it and what ever didn’t get she’s getting the money back for  She said okay and continued to shop around for a bit  Now one thing to note was this was at the height of springtime for allergy sufferers  I have really bad allergies and honestly this day I was riding the struggle bus on being at work  You could tell I wasn’t at   and that all I wanted to do go home and sleep  Anyways so she comes up to the counter to get her layaway out  She picks out the two pieces she wants to keep and tells my coworker she wanted to return the other four pieces  Co worker returns the four pieces she didn’t want and gives her the money back  The woman tells her she didn’t give her enough back  My coworker looks at her confused and the following conversation takes place  CW coworker  M me  W customerCW  yes ma’am I gave you back the price of each item as it states on your receipt  W  no you didn’t  I had six pieces in my layaway  you still owe me for the other two pieces  CW  no ma’am you kept those two pieces so you don’t get the money back for them  W  let me speak with your manager M  what’s going on  CW  she wants her money back for her layaway  She had six pieces in the layaway  She paid for the full layaway  only way to get her pieces out at the time  We ran off a very outdated system   and returned four of the six pieces  See   She shows me the receipts   M  ma’am the math is correct  The register isn’t going to mess something up like that  You started with six items  decided that you wanted to return four items and keep two items  which are in your bag  You can’t get money back for the full layaway unless you return the two items you kept  W  you aren’t understanding  M  yes I am  It’s simple math  I grab her four items she didn’t want and pulled the two out of her bag and set them on top of her bag  Now you started out with these six items right  W  yesM  and they totaled to  xxx xx  you decided not to get these four items so you return them for  I add the prices up plus tax   xx xx  W  that’s right M  okay so why would you think we owe you for these two items you’re keeping  W  ugh you don’t get it  Woman walks away and leaves  Husband grabs her bag and shrugs like he’s over it while apologizing and saying I’ll talk to her  Our store phone rings a few minutes later and it’s her  She then preceded to tell me she wants to talk this out like mature adults because she doesn’t want to call corporate and complain  She said she felt like I didn’t care that we ripped her off and that I didn’t want to be there and I was very condescending towards her  I stopped her and said I wasn’t condescending and that she didn’t understand at all and that she can’t get items for free which is what she was telling me she wanted  I told her I’m sorry if it seemed like I didn’t want to be there because I really didn’t as I did not feel good due to allergies  I told her I really wanted to be home sleeping because I was having a bad allergy attack that day but I couldn’t get anyone to come in and work  I told her I didn’t appreciate the fact that she couldn’t understand the simple math problem and to have her husband explain it to her better since he clearly understood what we were saying  I preceded to tell her to feel free to call my District Manager DM  at blah blah blah number because I would be calling her as soon as this conversation was over with and informing her of this issue  DM was called and I explained the situation  DM could tell just by talking to me on the phone that I didn’t feel good  I had worked for her for a few years by this point   I faxed her the receipt information so she could look at it all  The lady called her  minutes later and DM told her the same exact thing  DM calls me after the conversation and tells me to go home and get some rest once so and so from another store gets there in  minutes,4179,824
734,inlgej,1,1,Here’s how being nice enough to help customers while off the clock resulted in my first and only complaint Old story  but still makes me cringe  A couple years ago I worked in the retail area of a drug store  mostly in the cosmetics section It was a couple hours before closing  I  along with almost everyone else  had punched out for the day  I gathered my things from the back but had to do a little shopping before heading out      So there I was  still in uniform but very obviously off duty  with my shopping basket  jacket  and purse in hand  I’m picking out an eyebrow pencil when I get a text from someone I’m about to meet up with  so I reply  After maybe  seconds I start hearing sighs and whispers from  I think  an older mother and adult daughter a few metres away  But I’m not really paying too much attention to other customers  since right now I AM a customer  I continue texting when I hear the mother say         “EXCUSE me  is this product suitable for  x y z     so I  pocket my phone and answer their questions even though I’m not actually being paid to do so  and then we part ways  Eventually I end up just behind them in the checkout line  when this scene unfolds           “Can I speak to a supervisor ” The daughter   younger woman asks the cashier on duty  who also happened to be supervising covering breaks             Supervisor  “yeah that’s me  what’s up ”          Daughter  you’re gonna need to tell your staff that it’s extremely unprofessional to have PHONES on the sales floor ”      Both keep glancing back at me in line throughout this interaction           S  I’m the only person on the floor right now  everyone else is done for the day or on break            D  i know that’s not true  You should really pass this message along to whoever is in charge of YOU   because you’ve got staff on their phones instead of serving customers       S  there’s nobody working but me right now            Both ladies are not buying it and storm off after getting their receipt  I’m just standing there completely baffled as to how they can both ignore all evidence that they’re mistaken            I felt the need to text my manager in case either lady complained  which only resulted in the manager praising me for essentially working off the clock  and reassuring me that I had no obligation to ever help someone when I’m not being paid for it🤷🏼‍♀️,2402,502

737,in9dwg,1,16,Prejudice of some Quebec customers So I live in Montreal  Quebec in Canada  And this experience always stuck with me  It shows how strongly prejudiced some French Quebecers are  When I was  I had my first job working at Winners  a retail store with racks and racks of of clothes and shoes and all that jazz  When I started working there I was not good at french  raised in a completely English family  So I wasnt always able to help customers in French  But I knew enough french to tell them I would get them help from another employee  The customer thats always stuck with me came up to ask for help with her little boy  And when I told her Id be back with someone to help  She told me no  And asked me if I speak French  When I told her that I dont speak French well  she became incredibly upset  This mother in front of her kid felt it was appropriate to berate a  year old kid in front of everyone because he is English and isnt good at french  She told me I shouldnt even have a job and couldnt believe anyone would hire me  And forced me to get a manager to complain to them about me working for them  I was   First job  At this stage I had never really experienced something like this  That kinda fucked me up for a little while  Its crazy but its like that here  just based off the language we speak sometimes  I speak French now but i still dont think inexperienced  year old me deserved that,1428,273
738,in44kr,1,1,Customers and the stock room I have had to deal with customers that insist you check the stock room after you have informed them all you have left is on the sales floor  This store I worked at had expensive clothing and we had been hit hard by professional shoplifters  So there was a strict rule about leaving the sales floor we had phones on the sales floor to call back to the stockroom  managers office ect  So I would have a customer that did not believe we were out or limited on an item  I would call the stock room and the stock person would tell me what I already knew and told the customer  I tell the customer what the stock room manager said either we were out or what we have left is on the floor Then they insist I go myself and check the stock room  When I would explain how I was not able to leave the sales floor that is why I called for you  I would have to call a manager and get their premission to leave the sales floor  I can call a manager for you  Some get so mad before they storm away  A classic shoplifter trick is to get the sales person off the sales floor back in the stock room on a wild goose chase so they can steal hence the rules So usually after the customer storms away they find a manager and tell the manager you refused to help them  Then you are being questioned by a manager you explain we are out or all we have left is on the floor I called to check  Then the manager would have to call the stock room to verify my side of the story and prove to the customer what a sales person has already told them,1551,307
739,imyjoi,1,54,Had to find a severed finger This is from when I worked in a supermarket when I was  but I thought I would share  At our supermarket you can get joints of meat cut like ham or turkey  And my coworker was slicing some beef on this machine that had a spinning blade and she accidentally cut the end of her finger off and there was blood everywhere  The walls the floor just everywhere  She was then taken to hospital whilst me and the manager had to look for the end of the finger  When we eventually found it my MANAGER threw it away in the bin inside a plastic pot  We then got a call from the hospital that they wanted the finger but my manager had already threw it away in these trash bags  The trash bags belonged to a different department that cooked meat like chicken or ribs so they were full of grease and other disgusting stuff  My manager THEN ASKED ME TO SEARCH THE BAGS for the finger SHE threw away  There were  bags  So I search through all the bags for this olive pot and probably already crusty finger tip  I get to the LAST BAG and I find the pot but the finger is missing and as I am holding the bag open looking inside like     The finger is next to my hand sliding down the plastic  Thats when I realized I hate my job xThey didnt reattach the finger and I bought my colleague a condolence card and flowers for her lost finger tip,1359,265
740,imu8pz,1,17,Lady  I’m the wrong person  So  yesterday afternoon  I’m on cart duty since I work at a grocery store   This woman comes out of the store and stops to tell me  yes me  who is very clearly on cart duty  to tell me that she’s fed up with the store  and not coming back again  yada yada yadaTurns out that she had to remind the guy bagging her groceries several times to put the cold items together and he didn’t listen I should mention that he’s only been here for a week or so  give the guy some slack    She had to spend ten minutes rearranging her groceriesAll I told her was “I’m sorry to hear that” but she just breezed right over my attempted sentiments   well I tried  She was a nice lady too  So  yeah  I couldn’t decide whether she chose me to vent her feelings to  or she actually expected me to pass along her complaints  Oh well  I tried flagging down the store manager  but that never happened and by the time I saw her again today  I had completely forgotten  So  yeah  that’s my first tale from a grocery store girl on cart duty  I love it by the way  since I get to greet customers and get carts,1122,213
741,imrglp,1,7,A common mistake I see employees in smaller shops make is confronting suspected shoplifters inside the store after witnessing them conceal an item  Theres a reason big box loss prevention waits until  after  the suspect attempts to leave the store  or at least passes up the final point of sale  before stopping them  Up until that point  the suspect still has a legally reasonable argument that they intended to pay  They probably didnt  but they could either dump the merchandise  or change their mind and pay because they got spooked  Employees who are not loss prevention or management should approach only to offer assistance  That way  the suspect knows they they have been noticed by staff  Those with authority to stop suspects should watch them at all times to make sure they dont dump the merchandise  and then stop the suspect as they attempt to leave  Bad stops are a huge legal liability I live in an area that has a  bring your own bag  law  so they suspect has an additional excuse in that they can say they were just bringing their own shopping bag We all know they probably were trying to steal  but you must remove all doubt,1150,199

745,ildbsr,1,0,Asking for Opinions About a New Job Hey  So my friend and I are looking to start a company where we help Pest Control Companies to hire great people  Weve found that many of these company owners feel like there are few people out there who are good candidates for the job  which to be good at really just requires being nice to people when to go to their homes and being able to work independently and with your own schedule while youre out and about helping people with their homes   It also seems like a lot of really nice and considerate people are out there and feel like there arent that many good jobs  I want to try to help both groups of people by helping company owners orient their businesses towards what good people are looking for in jobs and help those good people find those jobs  All that said  my question is this  as someone in a retail position who has a lot of experience with customers  what is the   thing you would want to see in a new job offer For example  many people may want to see training and development opportunities within the company to get promoted raises more responsibility  Or someone may want to work somewhere that has more long term stability and can be a great career  Etc    Would love any and all thoughts  Thanks,1270,230

754,ik96fj,1,78,The “Pay It Forward” Chain  If there’s any formatting issues  I’m on mobile    so here’s the obligatory apology  For the past two years  I’ve worked part time as a cashier at a grocery store   I’ve been privy to several acts of kindness in the past  but there’s one instance that really stood out to me as particularly rare I remember it had been a fairly busy day  and I had already been at work for about   hours or so  I think it was one of those weird middle shift days because I don’t remember closing the store that night  Regardless  I was in a good mood and looking forward to my break  I was scanning the items of a lady in line  making small talk and smiling and generally trying to enjoy myself while making someone’s day a bit brighter  She looked to be fairly young and seemed tired  but was kind  and got about   worth of microwaveable stuff  I finished bagging her groceries  all of our baggers were busy  which was nothing new  so I was trying to be efficient  and she stayed at the end of the register adjusting her purse and wallet after paying  Since she was taken care of  I started ringing up the gentleman behind her  I don’t remember much about him other than the fact that he had quite a few small items and his total was about twice that of the lady before him  When he went to pay  the card reader gave him a chip error message  I directed him to try a few more times  since our machines are pretty sensitive and if the card is even a little smudged it won’t read it  Oftentimes when a person rubs the card’s chip between their fingers it will work  try that if you ever get the error message    However  when he tried it again  this time it registered as declined  He stepped away to call his bank and I saved his order so that I could move onto the next person  but I was stopped by the lady who had yet to leave  “I’ll pay for him ” She said  and she still looked    tired  Kinda done with life  That kind of expression  I could see a bit of hesitation there  and the guy had stepped away  so I said  “Are you sure  The total was  about   ” Again  this was about twice what Tired Lady had paid for her own order  I remember that she kinda paused for a moment  but she nodded  So I recalled the saved order and she payed for his items  I bagged them up  stuck the receipt inside one of the bags  and moved onto the next person in line  Tired Lady had just left the register when the guy came back with his card  and I got to tell him “Your groceries are already paid for  the woman in front of you took care of it ” I got a really weird look from this guy  Like  he looked like I told him I was keeping a tiny man in the register to organize the change  or something equally ridiculous  He looked    confused  “She did ” I nodded Confused Guy turned and looked at the guy behind him  then back at me  “Well  I guess I’ll pay for him then ” The dude behind him was not paying attention  and had only gotten a few items  so I just sort of blinked at Confused Guy and was like  alright then  I finished scanning the items  and Confused Guy stuck in his card  which was approved  guess he got his bank stuff worked out   About this time Distracted Guy realizes that I just handed him a receipt and is about to become Confused Guy    Before he can say anything  he’s told  “The lady ahead of me paid for mine  so I’m just passing it on  Have a nice day ” I’m just sort of standing there at that point  waiting to see what would happen next  Distracted Guy thanked Confused Guy and looked me dead in the eye and stated “Well  I’m paying for hers then ” This literally repeated three times down the line  and only stopped because no one else entered the queue  The last woman who had her groceries paid for by the person in front of her was a mom of two kids  and she was floored when the guy paid her   bill  She flipped when I told her she was the sixth person in a  “pay it forward chain” and I had a great time telling my coworkers about it when I went on break   I feel like there’s a lot of perceived peer pressure that is the incentive to be kind  And  for a few of them  I certainly felt that vibe But overall  it was just people paying it forward  And it was pretty cool  So thanks  Tired Lady  I hope you had a nice day after that  because you made a bigger impact than you realized,4383,836
756,ijnglr,1,10,Elderly guy made me sad  This happened a little over  weeks ago  but I still think about it  We get non English speaking customers all the time on the floor  and it can be a frustrating event for both of us  I usually make do by using google translate to help figure out what they want  but sometimes it ends up with me being scoffed at because I cant figure out what exactly they want  I was expecting it to be the same with this guy  but no  It seemed he had others try and help him  but they couldnt figure it out  so I stepped in  After him trying to describe what he needed  we finally figured out he wanted  a couple shelving units  When I took him to the aisle  he told me thank you  He looked like he was about to cry because he told me   this is my life   It just made me sad  It made me wonder how much he had been dismissed to react like that  He was quite elderly  I forget sometimes how patronizing these interactions can feel for the elderly  especially if English isnt their first language,1009,196
757,ij21a4,1,11,Thanks for threatening me  I’m keeping your stuff  This happened quite a few years ago but after reading some stories I thought I’d share  Near the end of the video rental era I worked at a game shop that was sometimes attached to a major video rental chain in the United States  Essentially  they would partition some of the stores and sell video games out of the other side One night I was by myself closing and a guy comes in with his wife to complain about a defective game  He had purchased Wii Play  a collection of mini games for Wii which at that time came bundled with a controller  The customer hadn’t brought the game disc which worked fine but complained the controller was defective and that he wanted a replacement  If we had a used copy on hand it wouldn’t have been a problem to swap out the bundle or just the controller but we actually didn’t have any used or new Wii controllers in stock  I explained to the guy I could get one from the closest store on my way in tomorrow morning but couldn’t replace it now  He saw that we had a new copy of Wii Play on display and demanded I exchange it from that one  This led to two problems  he had bought a used copy which was cheaper so he’d have to pay the difference and he hadn’t brought in the disc so I wasn’t even getting the old copy back I explained this to the guy and he started to lose it calling me names  threatening to report me  and eventually telling me I’d better do it or he’d “reach over the counter and beat my ass ” At this point some of the staff customers in the video store were taking notice but I offered calmly again to get the copy the following morning from our other location and then it occurred to me  I hadn’t asked if I could try out the defective controller to see what the issue might be  So  I asked him if I might take a look and maybe see if I can fix it  The manager at the video store is watching at this point and tells him to leave  The guy’s wife asks him to go and we get the obligatory “I’m never shopping here again  I spend so much money in this store   blah blah ” Since he’d put the controller down  I decide while he’s distracted to sync the remote to the demo WII behind the counter and start playing Super Mario Galaxy  I look over to him and ask “you didn’t know how to sync this to your system did you ” The dude freezes in his embarrassment and without collecting the controller the couple walks out  So I put the controller in the back and finish up delighted to have made that guy look like an idiot in front of the whole store  I wait a few weeks to see if they return and when they don’t  my manager eventually decides I deserve to keep the controller for the trouble  I did see them in the video store one more time a few months later and neither would make eye contact  I think the manager must have closed their rental accounts that night because I don’t think they ever came back again,2930,558

772,ignn32,1,19,When price matching fails For a while I was a volunteer working at a thrift that was run entirely by volunteers   This is the story of why I decided I would work there  I had selected what I wanted to buy and was waiting to buy it while the lady in front of me spoke to the cashier  She had about a dozen identical pieces of stemware  Half were marked    and the others marked      Now anyone who’s ever worked in a small thrift store knows stuff is dumped at the back door then sorted and put out the front and since it’s done by volunteers  it’s done someone erratically and it’s done as quickly as possible   So sometimes items from the same donation will get separated and priced by different people  which can result in identical items having slightly different prices   Apparently this is A Great Offense to the shoppers  Returning to our woman  she demanded to know what the cashier was going to do about it  The cashier looked straight back at her and said  “Yes  you’re correct some of them were mispriced  They should all be     However since they were put out with the wrong price  you can buy them for the price they’re marked ”Visibly annoyed the woman argued for a bit with her  demanding that they all be sold for    each  then stormed out leaving the glasses  The cashier company put them to one side to reprice the ones marked   Any other store in the same town would probably have sold all those glasses for at least a dollar each  We were a very cheap thrift store  we also had very little space  so we price things very inexpensively in order to move them as quickly as possible    Basically she didn’t buy them over a price difference that would have been about what one of one of them would’ve cost elsewhere  It was a great place to volunteer because we could do things like that and there was no “corporate“ for them to complain to  DEATH says the only bad part was we were not allowed to have a store cat,1953,364
773,igmnen,1,15,A woman is calling corporate to complain about me because I didn’t scan her coupon before ringing up any items This happened yesterday  so hopefully all of the details are still pretty fresh in my mind  To preface  I work for a chain that has a coupon available on their website  so many of my customers will pull out their phones for me to scan them  Usually they just set it on the counter  so I don’t often say anything about it  This woman was next in line after a particularly lengthy return  I had spent  minutes going over two receipts to figure out just what my previous customer was returning  and many items were rung up under the wrong department  So  some aggravation was justified  She gets to me  and I ask her to wait just a moment while I move the return items to the floor at my feet  She sighs  loudly  Not uncommon  people are dramatic  As I’m preparing to ring up her items  she pulls out her phone and makes no move to put any of her items on my counter  So  trying to be helpful  I say I don’t need the coupon just yet  “Well why didn’t you say something before letting me stand here with my phone in your face ” She retorts  I’m taken aback  even thinking at first that she has to be joking  She is not  I don’t remember exactly what I say next  however I know the woman responded with “at OTHER stores cashiers will scan the coupon” “Yes ” I reply  “I just need to ring your items up first ” FINALLY she gives me items to ring  But  I can’t ring anything just yet  She needs to find the slip she got from the fabric counter  Her fabric was still on the bolt  one again trying to be helpful  I ask if she had an employee measure everything out  as cashiers working up front cannot calculate what fabric will cost  It didn’t seem to bother her too much  however she was very short with me  She finds the slip  so I start entering the prices  Things mellow out until she points out that she is taking home empty fabric bolts for free and she already spoke with the woman running the fabric counter  Okay  fine  I think that’s allowed  Frankly it’s the first person I’ve ever seen do this  Still  I feel compelled to ask if she found the cart near the counter because we keep one over there for empty bolts to be moved to the back  At this  she rolls her eyes  flags over my manager  and asks if she can have the store’s number  He tells her it’ll be on the receipt  and she corrects herself  she wants the CORPORATE number  Mind  I’m still halfway through her transaction  so she has yet to pay and actually get her items  Finally it’s time for the coupon  I’m completely over it at this point  I’d been fasting for over a day  autophagy  and was hungry and cranky  I walk her through everything   not really caring how nice I am at this point  Not great customer service  but still  Somehow she finds no reason to be upset about my sudden attitude change  She leaves without any further fanfare  and I am reeling from the interaction from the rest of the night  Frankly  I’m still reeling  Working retail is great,3054,570

776,ig3q0x,1,11,Reading is Hard and Being Told Your Wrong is Harder I am a cashier at a grocery store and I was at the first lane  That means I always have a steady flow of customers  A customer was buying a lot of items for some place that required her to be tax exempt  It started off well  but then something didnt scan the  correct  price  The items were country ribs  She believed they were  Buy One Get One Free BOGO    just like the pork chops were  So I called the service desk and they told me to call the meat department  The meat department said that the ribs were on sale  but not BOGO  The lady insisted there was a sign above and below the ribs that indicated BOGO  She then told me to call a manager  but before I could call up the manager she dragged another poor cashier walking by into the mess  He had to run over to the meat section to find the signs  He did and took pictures proving the ribs were not BOGO  just on sale  The lady then said she would buy the ribs to not hold up the line bit too late for that   but will speak to a manager to get the  actual  price  Now items can be misplaced by both workers and customers  but that is why reading signs and not just the bold letters and pretty percentages is important,1227,237

789,id97su,1,18,On my second day of work  i accidentally withdrew  thousand dollars over  As im danish  and this took place in Denmark  i apologize for my English  and if some customs seems off So this takes place back when i was  years of age  and had just started my job as a cashier down at the local supermarket  We offered to withdraw cash to a certain point above what the customer had bought in goods  which converted was about a    On to the story This was my very second time working as a cashier  and the first time i had been a cashier without a trainer helping me  so i was still new to how the machine worked  A middle aged lady wanted to withdraw a   above the amount she had bought groceries for  and i happily complied  I pressed   in  and the machine for some reason didnt allow it  No problem i thought  I will just press   in again  And the machine allowed it The lady put in her card  paid for everything  and asked for the receipt  in which to my horror  said she paid   above  meaning i had to pay out over a hundred thousand dollars in cash  My dump ass immediately notified her  that we probably didnt have that much cash in the registry  and she was  for obvious reasons  rather frustrated  and demanded to see my manager while yelling and screaming at me  As this was my second day at the job  i were rather scared that i was going to get fired already Introducing Good Guy Boss  We will call him Mike Mike came down to assess the situation  and the customer and i explained the situation to him  all the while she was insulting me and basically demanding me to get fired   Which in hindsight  is probably not that unreasonable a reaction  Mike calmly looks her in the eye  and tells her he will fix it  and she can go home without a worry Hearing this  she began to scream at Mike  How could i ever possibly go home without a worry  when Ive just withdrawn a hundred thousand dollars in a supermarket  Are you stupid or something  This very clearly annoyed Mike  and he immediately replied   Yes  because i know how banks works  Now go home   He was very doing his very best to not start a yelling competition with the customer  She begrudgingly  after some more arguing  went on her merry way home At the end of my shift  i was called in by Mike to his office  where i was absolutely certain i was going to get the boot  What actually happened  ended up being one of my fondest memories from retail Basically  he immediately told me that it was not my fault  and it was her own fault that she had paid the hundred thousand dollars  as she could see on the screen the amount that was going to be paid  After that  we spent a solid   minutes laughing about how red her face had been  and the whole situation  I was also informed that the bank had straight up just not allowed the transaction  and it had been fixed within an hour or so of the incident I didnt end up getting fired  and ended up working there for a few additional years  but i will never forget the day in which in withdrew    in a supermarket  and how amazing a boss i had at the time,3122,575
790,iczvmd,1,69,You think you can steal   worth of groceries  Think again  So  I work at a reasonably large grocery store  I’m a manager for the front end  and have a pretty good eye for people stealing  Most of the time  though  they make it extremely obvious  Well  I’m up at my computer filling stuff out  which just happens to face the front door  Now  there are two doors to the store  one is used primarily for entering  while the other is used primarily for exiting  There are no signs anywhere  it’s just how people have collectively decided to do things  I look up  and see a lady with a FULL cart of food walking out the “entrance door” with everything loose and not in bags  Obviously  she’s stealing  Because we can’t just claim people are stealing  I immediately run to the back to look at the cameras  I see her walk to the bathroom  then immediately leave the store So I run  I see he standing a few stores down from work  and sprint over there  As I sprint  a car drives up and she starts unloading  Here’s the conversation  Me  meThief  tCar driver  CDMe  hello ma’am  I’m sorry  but you took this cart pretty far from the store  and I noticed you didn’t have anything bagged  Is it okay if I ask to see a receipt for your transaction T  oh  my sister has the receipt  I’m just loading things up to my Uber  Me  well  I will need to see a receipt otherwise I’ll have to call this in to the police  T  well then  I’ll call my sister to come back and show the receipt  Until then I have to go Me  Ma’am  I saw you on camera  and didn’t see you shopping with anyone  so if anyone has the receipt it’s you T  you can’t stop me from shopping  I bought these  okay   Continues loading items into the car Me  look  I saw you walk out from the bathrooms on camera  I saw you not pay  and I saw you walk over here  You need to give me these back or I will call the police  T  call the police  then I then went to the front of the car  and took a picture of the driver  and said “just so you know  what your ride is taking is over the amount needed to be considered a felony  So if you don’t want to be involved  I’d deny this ride ”CD  I’m not her ride  I’m her friend Me  well  as a friend  I would tell her to stop or else you’ll be involved with a felony  I went back and took pictures of the license plate  and pictures of the lady loading things into the car  Me  Just so you know  if you take these items  you and your friend will be convicted of a felony charge  T  well fine then  take your damn food back  But keep it in the cart because I’m coming back with my receipt and you’ll be sorry  You’ll be fired  You’re whole store will go down Me  If you come back with a receipt  I’ll gladly quit my job  Just do the right thing  She ended up giving back all the groceries and leaving  Surprise  She never came back  Stupid people  all I deal with are stupid people,2912,550
791,icxl3e,1,38,He liked his stolen watch so much  he came back to  buy  one  I used to work as Assistant Store Manager at a retailer of primarily watches and leather goods  At the particular location where I worked  we had three points of entry and never much staff working    depending on the time of day and the day of the week   The floor plan was set up so that  even if you were trying really hard  while also not helping any customers   you could barely see two entrances at once  Additionally  we only kept about   of our display product under glass  had no security guard  and our watches were in all the        range  It was an LP nightmare  and uniformed officers and detectives got pretty used to visiting at least monthly  if not weekly during busy shopping seasons  to take down theft reports and to follow up on them  It was stressful  tedious  and probably the worst part of the job One busy summer weekend day  when I was the only manager on duty  we noticed two watches were missing from their displays  so I had to step off the floor to review our security camera footage  We had something like  different cameras  and throughout my tenure at this retailer  I had gotten extremely proficient at snipping footage and capturing stills from our security cameras to provide to our LP team and the police department  So while reviewing the footage  I found some great angles of the culprit concealing watches and a pretty good shot of his face from when he entered the store  Needless to say  I knew what the guy looked like We informed the other retail location in our area that we had been hit  only to find out the guy had gone straight there  and  in the short amount of time it took us to figure out the watches were missing and review the footage  he had already returned one of the watches for store credit  Bold Cut to  About a month later  Im the only manager working again  and guess who enters the store  The shoplifter  He has returned to the scene of the crime  and guess what   Hes brought his fiancée  And guess what else   HES WEARING THE WATCH HE STOLE AND WANTS TO USE HIS STORE CREDIT TO BUY ANOTHER WATCH AS A GIFT FOR HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATE   Knowing that  the best deterrent to shoplifting is excellent customer service   this is something I learned in luxury retail that has worked pretty well in my experience  since you can keep an eye on things while also not being the jerk whose behavior is blatantly accusatory   I started helping the guy as he and his fiancée shopped  while also whispering to all my associates that we needed to watch him because he had stolen from us before He shops with us for about an hour  playing up how excited he is about his watch and about getting one for his associate  But folks  he had no clue who he was up against  Five years of improv training  anyone  On the sales floor Im all smiles  trying on watches with him and his fiancée  but in the couple of moments I get to walk away and hand them off to my associate  Im able to sneak off into the office to call the police and to confirm from my footage that this is   our guy By the end of the interaction  Im in the cash wrap with my associate who is gift wrapping the new watch  and our thief kind of corners us to see what were up to  We can feel him getting progressively more antsy    which is reasonable  since were taking our sweet time finishing the transaction as we await the cops  We assure him our system is just slow  and he sees my associate  clearly  trying to perfect the gifts bow After weve finished the transaction and handed him his ill gotten wares  we watch as he hurries his comfortably seated fiancée out of her chair so they can get the hell out of dodge  They exit  and we see him through our window fumbling with his phone to reactivate the app based  ride share moped they were using to travel  As hes doing this  the cops cruise by and stop just a few car lengths ahead  They get out of their car  and as they approach our door  I look at them with eyes wide  frantically pointing out our thief  They go and arrest they guy literally just as hes sitting down on the moped with his fiancée  who is visibly baffled by this development After all was said and done  the detectives come and commend me on doing their job for them  shoplifting arrests after the fact rarely happen  so they were pleased to close a case   and I end up looking the guy up  because   he gave his real name   for the transaction   and I find out hes some kind of jet setting yoga instructor  I did see his yoga instructor bio  who travels the world    and literally has Instragram posts of him   wearing his stolen watch    Clearly  the guy couldve afforded it but got some kind of thrill from shoplifting and returning to the scene of the crime  As for the fiancée  while I have sympathy for her  its probably better she found out about his kleptomania before saying  I do  Anyway  I left that job a few weeks later to work at another company  where Im happy to report that I havent had to file a single police report for the entire year Ive been there,5118,930
792,icuwbj,1,2,Can you buy this for me  I used to work for a retail store and due to where it’s location was it had a homeless camp inside a small patch of woods located right behind the store    Occasionally there would be homeless people frequenting the parking lot or even cone into the store    One day a homeless person comes in and starts looking around   One of the assistant managers  Bart  saw him and was available to help so he approached asking if he needed any help    The homeless guy was looking for a new backpack    Bart showed him where they were and assisted him until he left the store    In which Bart came up to the customer service desk where I happened to be and asked me to put a backpack he was holding behind the counter    I did so and being as I witnessed part of what happened and recognized the homeless guy I asked Bart what went on   Bart said that it took the guy a few minutes to pick out a backpack to his liking and as he saw the price asked Bart If he could buy it for him or lend him the money to buy it  Bart informed him that was not allowed by the company for employees to buy things for the customers   The guy then asked if he could hold the bag for him and he will be back later with enough money   I had to leave shortly after that but to my knowledge the homeless guy did not come back to buy the backpack,1343,278
793,icp0wn,1,24,A Disorganized Supplier Can’t Do Things Right  So where I worked  we would often order a good chunk of our plumbing supplies through a certain supplier  And each time I’ve dealt with this company  it’s been nothing but headaches and just stupidity on their end which I will tell about  The first time I dealt with them  my manager placed a order with them  and I had to receive it when it came in  However  when the ordered arrived  I didn’t get any info from them on how much they were charging us for the parts  so I had no idea what I needed to charge for retail  So I contact the company  go through their auto system  going through the prompts  until I get to their accounting department  I tell them what’s going on  saying I need the cost of our order  They tell me they don’t do that  I have to speak with their sales and orders department  and they give me the phone number  I call up Sales  give them the same story  They tell me they don’t do that  that I have to get the pricing from Accounting  I was confused  and told them accounting told me I get it from you  They told me they don’t do that  and give me the number to contact accounting directly without the auto prompts  So  I contact accounting  tell them I talked to sales  and they told me I get it through you  Accounting told me they don’t deal with that at all  it’s sales that handles that  To summarize the next little bit  I phone back and forth maybe  to  times  getting the same response from each department  I forget which department was on  but the person on the other end said to me “I can’t understand why they can’t just give you the invoice ” I was getting rather aggravated  and told the person on the phone “That’s what the other department is saying about you guys ” So the person says they’ll look after it  they contact the person needed  and ask for my email to it can be sent to me  I was glad I was finally getting somewhere  so I end the call  and wait  A day goes by  still no email  Fed up  I talk to my boss  asking if he has any contacts in this company  because I still haven’t gotten any invoice  He tells me he’ll contact his rep  and get me one  Less then a hour later  my boss hands me the invoice  Now here’s the kicker  I think close to  months pass  and I suddenly see a email from the supplier  and low and behold  it’s the invoice for the order  This is just a for shadowing of what this company is like  There is still more to this story  So maybe about two years ago  my boss wanted me to set up another order with the company  I get the order sheet the company provided  and make up a order  and send it through  Not long after  I get the confirmation email  with them asking me to look through the order  and make sure everything is looking good incase changes needed to be made  I look through it  and notice I made a few mistakes I needed to change  So I phone the name that was attached to the email confirmation  and explain to the person that there are mistakes  and just need to make a few changes  The person responds with “Well  the order is finalized  so it can’t be changed ” I was flabbergasted  I said I never gave the final approval like the email specified  I can’t remember the exact wording she used  But it was along the lines of its been sent to their warehouse for the workers to pick  and changing it would be tricky with their computers  To me  sounded like they could do it  but they just didn’t want to be bothered by it  Angry  I asked them if the order can be canceled  She told me it can be canceled  so I told her “Cancel it  I’ll redo the order  and send it back to you ” So she tells me she canceled the order  and I redo it and send it in again later that day  A week later  the order arrives  and everything seems good  But  a week later  another order arrives  After a while of looking through the items  I realize the second order was the order I had originally canceled  I call the company  steaming mad  but kept my cool  as I explain to them what happened  There was some small confusion on their end  because I used the same Purchase Order for my store for both orders  so I had to read them the different invoice numbers  and tell them which one was the one that was canceled  The person on the phone says “Ok  It doesn’t look like you were charged for it  We’ll give you our shipping account number  and you can just send it back ” So I seal the box  put a shipping label on it  and the next day  it’s on it’s way back to the supplier  It gets worse  So a few weeks later  the person at my store who handles the accounting called me to her office  and says she has two invoices from the company  with the same purchase order number on it  When I looked  I saw the supplier did indeed charge us for the canceled order  which was over  dollars  I told her hold onto it for now  and that I’ll call the company  So I call again  feeling like I’m about to snap  I go through the same process on the phone where I explain to them what happened  with them being confused with the two different invoice numbers  Finally  they get what’s going on  and tell me they’ll submit the refund  but it will take  months for it to be processed  “I told them that was completely unacceptable  That my company shouldn’t be out  dollars for  months  because of a screw up that happened on their end  They told me their accounts are swamped with issuing refunds  so that is the reason for the time  I roll my eyes thinking “Gee  I wonder why ” So  we wait  months  still no refund  I call them again  They tell me they refunded has been processed  and are just waiting for it to be signed off by the head of the department  and that we should see it soon  Not long after  I had to leave a few weeks because of surgery  When I come back  the accounting worker told me she still hasn’t received any refund  So I call them again  and get the same answer from them  that it just needs to be signed off  I tell them to hurry it up  because we are out of a lot of money  and they assured me they’ll get it to me soon  So I tell my accounting worker what went on  and she told me she’ll keep a eye out  Months go by  still nothing  I phone every few months  giving them hell  and with them apologizing saying they’ll get it out right away  Probably before Christmas  we still haven’t gotten the refund  and we are going on over a year since the original order  I contact the company again  doing my best to stay calm  because I know how it feels to get yelled at for something that doesn’t involve you  The women I speak too on the phone was really good  She was just as shocked and mortified about how long we’ve been waiting to get a simple refund back  She tells me she’ll contact the their rep for our company  and he’ll call soon to get this resolved  Guess what  never got any call  I’ve since been transferred to another store  so I don’t know the status if the money ever made it too us  But I told my boss at one point  that we should look into other suppliers  because this one can’t seem to do anything right,7111,1360

801,ibuabb,1,9,The barbeque and the credit card When I worked for this retail store  I got this one customer coming to me at my register   She had with her some stuff and a    barbeque grill   She also wanted to sign up for a credit card as well   I was excited that I would be making a killer sale and getting a CC signup   This woman  well call her  Betty   was told that if she got the CC  shed save  X dollars off of her purchase   I had to tell her that she would only get the discount if she qualified and she seemed ok by that so I walk her through the process  As I walk Betty through the process of signing up for the CC  she had a little trouble understanding some of the questions that the application asked her for since English was not her first language   After answering all the questions  she gets a printout stating that she was not approved for the CC and I had to tell her that   Betty asks if she would still get the discount and I said no because she was denied approval for it   She then looks at the grill and asks if she can get a discount off of the grill because it was missing the instructions  it wasnt  she was confused as there were three kinds of instruction booklets inside the grill    Betty then tells me that she knew someone who worked at the same store and said that they would let her use the employee discount and it was X    I told her that wasnt the case here and I couldnt do anything for her at this point   Betty changes her mind and decides against buying the barbeque grill because she would only buy it if she had the discount  we had other similar items for sale that were half that price and still worked just as good  I shouldve made that suggestion    She then asks me to put the barbeque on hold for her because she was going to call the number on the denial printout and talk to them so that she can get approved for the CC AND THEN come back and get her grill with her  X discount   After she left  I pushed the grill over to the customer service department and told them the whole story   After I clocked out for the day  one of the ladies from customer service told me that the woman never came back for the grill at all so they put it out on the sale floor I dont seem to think that Betty understood the whole  discount with the credit card signup  thing,2313,460

805,ib4qgi,1,31,Faith in humanity   dwindled Back in the mid s I worked in a local music store  instruments  not CDs   We had a nifty device that was basically a PC in a KIOSK with a touch screen  The PC contained thousands of songs worth of sheet music  You could pick the song you wanted in the key you wanted an it would print out to a lazer printer a few feet away  For the time it was magic   For the time it was also a bit ahead of its time as the touch screen wasnt too incredibly durable and stopped working after a while  There was a big thing with the company who provided the PC and kiosk but in the meantime we added a mouse and placed it on a small shelf right next to the PC along with a brightly lettered sign right at eye level above the screen that read  Touch Screen Broken   Please Use Mouse  along with an arrow pointing to the mouse   This same mouse that was about  inches away     Not a single day went by where there werent fingerprints all over the screen  thick greasy ones too   ewwwww  and at least one person would stop me with an incredulous look on their face to inform me  hey    this isnt working     It made me ponder  If we had our average customer in one room with the sheet music kiosk  and an adjacent room with a gorilla  a banana dangling from the ceiling  and a tire  rope  and stick   would the customer get the music first  Or would the gorilla get the banana first  Personally  I think the gorilla would get the banana then print out a song and leave  Possibly the gorilla would have to show the customer where the mouse was  After a few years of this it started to get upsetting,1628,306

815,i9ecg2,1,59,For the fifth time  no  you cant buy those  Pretty short anecdote from a terrible shift last week that was full of little annoying encounters throughout the day  A truly cursed shift  Sorry for mobile formatting For preface  I work at a small record store business  Were on a college campus  so with school coming into season  were getting my  favorite  type of customer  people coming in looking not for records  not for CDs  or even cassettes  but posters  which we have about  of  maximum  at any given time    nobody buys them   This one kid comes in  probably just moving into his dorm  looking for posters  At the front of the store  faced right towards the entrance  we have a display of the posters we actually keep stocked  Its even complete with a big sign that says  POSTERS   x price   in massive bold letters  Like I said  there arent many  but the ones we  do  have in this display are at least new  and feature currently popular artists  Kid walks straight past this  but somehow manages to find the ancient flip book of posters that we have wedged wayyy back in the corner of the store  Its essentially as close to being in our backstock area of the store as possible  with a wall partially blocking it off  because we dont stock these posters anymore  The only ones left are rolled up in the bottom rack  covered in dust  and the ones in the flipbook are just an old display  We cant remove them without taking the whole booklet apart  which nobody has even shown me how to do  so well only sell whatever posters still linger in the bottom rack  covered in multiple years of dust  but are easily retrievable  Anyways    this kid goes to the rack  Looks at the posters for a couple of seconds  Comes to the counter  and asks if were still selling the posters  I tell him yes  as long as he can find the poster he wants in the rack below  and not just in the flip book  because we cant remove the posters from the flip book  He says great  and goes back to the posters  About  minutes later  hes back  and lo and behold  he isnt holding a poster  I know whats coming   Can you get one of the posters down from the book or are you only selling the ones from the rack   I  deep internal sigh  and repeat that no  we cant get the posters out of the book  but he can grab any of the posters from the rack  or the display by the door  I am not kidding when I say he came back  more times  each with the same question in slightly different wording  before deciding to just go ahead and buy the   sticker hed grabbed  and leave  I cannot express to you how many times a very similar thing has happened  but this was absurd  How people fail to understand information after its been repeated this many times is beyond me  TL DR kid cannot comprehend that we can only sell him the posters I told him were for sale,2856,524

823,i70cwi,1,5,Learning a lesson from my couponing customers About a decade ago  fresh out of college  I was back home with my parents and working retail for a few months until getting a more full time career For reference  the store I was working at was the merchandise store for our local NFL team  and often ran specials and cross promotions with other local businesses A few weeks before christmas I had a few ladies come in to make a large purchase and paid all in   coupons  I was actually surprised the system rang it up  but it all worked and they got a few hundred dollars of stuff virtually free  Purely out of curiosity  I asked them how they got so many coupons and they just cryptically replied  frozen vegetables  When I get home I look it up  The coupons came from a supermarket promotion  buy  items off of a list and get a  dollar coupon  One of the items on the list was frozen vegetables  which often went on sale for   each  Close to a solution  but not quite there  Then I found it  The grocery store also had matching on manufacturers coupons under    And newspaper coupons for  cents off on this brand came up pretty often Did you know you can buy bulk clipped coupons online  For about  bucks I got  coupons for frozen vegetables on Ebay  Over a couple of weeks I  bought  hundreds of pounds of peas  carrots  and corn without paying a cent  and getting coupons for sports gear with every checkout  I ended up filling  freezers at home and still donating a ton to the local food bank and my old fraternity house  Two days after I quit my retail job  I strolled back in with a fat stack of coupons  I was able to finish my full Christmas shopping list for my entire extended family  plus get myself a   dollar leather jacket  basically for free  And my whole family ate healthy for months afterward,1835,337

825,i6w9qk,1,2,My Self Respect goes down the toilet This story is going to have some rather graphic descriptions so continue reading at your own risk  So Ive mentioned before in other posts that I used to work at a Gas Station years ago   The one I worked at was right off the freeway and given how we were the only major city for miles we were normally pretty busy  and unfortunately some days our restroom would reflect that  Inside the restroom there was an additional light switch  that when flipped would turn on a blue light outside letting us know that someone felt the room needed cleaning  If you saw it on you were suppose to go check and clean or restock whatever was needed  We also cleaned it at the end of the day regardless  Now Ive seen some bad messes in there  weve had construction workers use it as their personal shower before  someone who  well  didnt make it in time  And the of course the evidence of drug use you find in there as well All that to say Im not squeamish about what Ive had to clean up in there except for one time  That time was any normal day  started my shift early and everything went normal  Had just a couple hours left when our assistant manager asked for me  She said a customer just came out of the restroom and  said there was an Issue  All he sad was it wouldnt go down and he left  She looked inside and said she tried using the plunger but it wouldnt work and asked told me to take care of it  When I asked how she handed me a trash bag and a pair of thick rubber gloves  they went all the way to my elbows thankfully  Knowing my fate was sealed I walked over and opened the door  The smell that came from that toxic cesspool was downright awful  no human being could have done this  I opened the lid and start retching  The only thing keeping my stomach contained was the knowledge of where Id be putting my face over to do so  I open the trash bag and just reach in with my thankfully gloved hands and pull out this sin to humanity and in the bag it goes along with my gloves  I take this and sprint out of the store  back exit  and throw the unholy abomination in the first dumpster  I then run to the next dumpster and settle my stomach there  I slowly walk back into the store and my assistant manager just says go home when you feel you can drive and Ill punch you out when your shift is over  I nod and without a word go to my car and drive off  Needless to say I spent the rest of the day in the shower Just as a final note I dont resent the assistant manager for this  she had her reasons for not cleaning it herself,2581,498

830,i63z5e,1,0,A short and funny tale I recently spoke to a former co worker at a big chain pharmacy and we were discussing dummy employees  She still works there so I was treated to the following story    A shift supervisor was in the backroom when the door alarm for the entrance to the sales floor went off  An apologetic customer told the supe that the employee up front was in trouble and laying passed out on the counter  When the supervisor got up front  the cashier was asleep on the photo counter  but not really in trouble   just sleepy  The supervisor began ringing up the customers while the cashier pulled herself together  Except she then put a few chairs together and curled up for a nap  while the supervisor was still ringing customers It seems she did claim she was having some sort of stress emergency but was somehow not fired  and is now wondering why shes not scheduled more,889,160

832,i5zyco,1,53,But I want my money back My work only provides a refund if the customer brings back the same card used to make the purchase  for security reasons This happened a couple of years ago  A lady came in and wanted to return something   and decided to stand there on her phone messaging someone throughout this whole transaction When I asked if she had the same card   she said  no   my daughter paid for it   I informed her    that we need the same card   otherwise I can give her a store credit   no   I want my money back I informed her again    what our return policies are   and what we can offer as an alternative  I also informed her that she had another week available to return the item  I cant come back another day   I need to do this today  I want my money back So I repeat to her    that if she wants it done today   I can give her a store credit  At this point she is still on her phone  and she looks up   yes okay fine   do that  As shes on her phone  I repeat myself again    to make sure she knows what Im doing Me   okay so Im going to return these items and put the money on store credit   is that okay   The lady   still on her phone   doesnt bother to look up at me and says  yes thats fine  So I return the items and complete the transaction  The whole time she was  of course   on her phone  Me   okay so here are your receipts and your store credit Customer  finally breaking eye contact from her phone    I said I didnt want a store credit I once again repeated    what the return policy is   and told her that I asked her if this was okay and she agreed  but I said I want my money back I called for my manager and walked her through the whole ordeal  While I was explaining everything to the manager  the customer was once again standing there on her phone  The customer ended up leaving and coming back about  minutes later with her daughter  who was in the Shopping Centre the whole time     We ended up putting the refund onto the daughters card  This whole situation could have been avoided if she had just asked her daughter to come to the store to begin with,2135,407
833,i5wxtj,1,50,Man screams at me because we dont hold meetings about him specifically Back when I worked at a gas station and was a new hire I had a lovely interaction A part of the job at the cash registers was that you had to promote sales of whatever was on offer infront of your register  usually some cheap candy  cookies or chewing gum  You get the idea This man comes in and I go through the normal interaction  confirming the pump he got gas at  asking for his bee themed reward card  etc When I asked him if he would like to make use of our offer for a packaged cookie for € he turns irate He starts yelling about how we always offer them  why we still offer it to him specifically and why we dont discuss that we shouldnt offer then to him because hes not interested  ever I was a bit shaken after the interaction because it was my first week and I was still actively trying to do the extra sales   weeks later Ive already learned that noone does the extra sales and management doesnt really care and that the customer is definitely not king Queue angry man There was a sizeable line at my register and I didnt much try to speed things up  By the time the man is next in line hes fuming and barely talks  so I take my sweet time bring extra super friendly  going through every line of interaction   asking for the pump number   asking for his rewards card  offering him a reward card with a in depth explanation of why he should get one  asking him if he was sure he didnt want a card  asking him if he wanted to join the savings program for whatever crap we were peddling to save for with stamps  explaining the entire program and the wonderful product he could get  asking him if he would like to make use of our special offer with regards to whatever was infront of our register and telling him how much he could save  finally he gets to pay and I offer him his receipt   give him a very friendly goodbye whilst he is raging internallyOther customers and my colleague were pissing themselves  the man never spoke up againGlorious,2065,379
834,i5uyii,1,9,Ill remember this for years to come Its hot out where I live right now  c or f  we are not used to that  usually summer is   with rain  and that reminded me of an old story A couple of years ago I worked in a store at a trainstation without airconditioning  It was summer break and we had a particularly quiet day  We were bored out of our minds  melting into the counter and eagerly waiting for any customer so we could finally do something  Now this was a trainstation  so people usually come in all hurried because they are going to catch miss their train  But then this guy came in and told us he missed his train and now he had to wait an hour because the next train   minutes  had been canceled  The platform was already full of people and he knew in  hour he had to cram himself into an overfilled train while it was cooking outside and our trains dont really have quality airconditioning  He looked a bit bummed  So we chatted with him for a while  suggested some books and magazines he might like  He was shopping a bit and nobody came in for over half an hour  We were eating cookies and we offered him some  It was genuinely nice to have a gentle soul in our shop  So after  minutes he went to slowly catch his train   minutes later he came back with ice cream  two spoons and two cold drinks  gave it to us and left to catch his train  We felt like the luckiest people in the world  And Ill remember this random act of kindness for a long time to come,1487,286

838,i5amom,1,2,My fault for letting a customer drop a TV  A customer I was trying to help buy a TV dropped the TV in front of me and left me there for a manager to see First time posting here and on mobile so please be with me as I cant sleep without getting some answers So I have been working at a decent wholesale club chain for not very long  It has been a really bad week  one bad event leading to the next each day today but I think this is one of the worst things you can do I had just clocked in and was moving some carts around as thats what Im supposed to do when a call comes into meet a member at the front desk  I get there and the lady at the desk asks me to help a customer out with getting a TV  Everything was going fine as I spoke with the customer saying how it was a good deal and all of that  the supposed buyer being a middle aged black woman  as the clerk searched for the tv remote We start proceeding to the TVs once the remote had been found  Now Im not exactly the muscular type  Im pretty skinny really  but I have been pushing carts and have helped move pallets of stuff in the back  I was expecting the TV to be relatively smaller  maybe around  inches or less  in the box or something like that but at the that much of a discount it just makes sense now  The TV was about  feet above ground  appearing to be mounted to a stand  At this point it would have been a good time to ask for some help but the customer then starts asking me if Im new to this in which I reply yes to an extent  She then suggests she get on a roller I had brought to bring the tv and does so saying  please dont let me fall    From here I start considering calling for some help so I can help her with the TV but she was still in the roller so I couldnt let go of it  She then finds out that its not mounted to the stand but placed on it and starts pushing it to the side for whatever reason The next thing I know it  the TV hits the stand  and she screeches  The TV was completely fine before  but now its got a good amount of scratches on the screen  Im dead pale at this point  which is interesting because I have been baking in the sun the entire time Ive been working there so Im really tan  Im thinking about how this is the worst thing that I could happen  in pure shock  and in the middle of that shock I try to get up there  trying to prevent any furthur damage  Dont let me fall   She says  as shes now just trying to come down from the ledge  I try to keep the cart stable while barely holding this TV now  She comes down and I get up to set it upright and it doesnt  I then call for back up and in the middle of all of this she saying Im sorry and that shell  be back  or something of the sort and Im still there holding the TV for an excrusiating  minutes as another guy  better built then I am  finally comes down and manages to get the TV away from me by himself  He calls the manager and I tell him the customer made the TV fall just as this manager comes around and he tells her everything He then tells me to find the woman as we  or rather I  didnt know at this point she really didnt buy the TV yet  and tell her to come to the front  Im shaken ad I dont know what this would do to me but I look around and find her on the OTHER side of the store  I come up to her and ask if she bought the TV in which she says she doesnt   Youre not going to get in trouble are you   She asks   I dont really know  I say  as that just comes out of my mouth  probably not he best thing to say looking back at it now  She then asks for my name for whatever reason and asks for my phone number but I tell her they may need her in the front  She then wants to give her phone number to me but I believe I tell her again they may need her in the front and I leave for the front desk  I look around for the guy with the TV before finding the manager in front  I ask her if the customer needed to come up and she says she didnt  How embarrassing   I thought my interaction with the woman would end there but just as I was helping with an order I hear from behind me  Im pissed now   and  Oh Im really pissed now   And low and behold its the same woman from earlier  She was heading to the front desk and we made eye contact and I turn away as I just needed to take a break  She then proceeds to go the front desk  I head outside and that was that Thank you for reading up to this point  Looking back at it now I definitely Ill call for back up when I really need it but I really want to know what others think about this situation as I havent really told anyone close to me about this situation yet  The big question being  is it my fault  What do you think the managers will think of me,4738,962

842,i4vkyr,1,0,Tired of  Get so many customers to sign up for use the rewards app   I work at a   We are launching some new functions to the app soon and so of course  we got a letter down the chain saying all employees need to get to   of customers using the rewards  phone number or the app  This isnt terrible of an option  besides the fact the rewards do nothing for anything outside of food and drink  a few coupons for specific beers and tobacco products in specific amounts  but nothing general   So on third shift when everybody is just grabbing a beer or a cigarillo pack of smokes    there is no reason to have the rewards app  Yet the corporate guys above the franchisee breath down all our necks to pester everybody to sign up  amp  xB I honestly dont mind my job  I like the customers and love the tasks  when I get to do them without interruption   but I feel blah at being pushed to ask if they have the app want to sign up  then give them a sales pitch until they agree    Especially if there is a line and Im trying to help every customer as fast as I can  amp  xB Needed to get that out before this new app stuff launches,1149,209
843,i4qa9t,1,3,Got in BIG Trouble I work at a gas station  and recently we’ve been having problems with the registers  they’re fine now Yesterday night while me and a coworker were changing shifts  the register wasn’t letting either of us log in  I had logged out on mine  and kept saying that someone was already logged in  I called the help desk and we tried rebooting it and such  The guy asked me to get my manager  who wasn’t at the store at the time  it was am and she came in around am   to use her code to see if it would let her log in I should’ve called her  problem is  she gives me really bad anxiety  She scares me and I was afraid she’d get angry that I was calling her so late I wasn’t sure what else to do  so my coworker and I figured we’d close the store  She couldn’t ring people out and we thought it was a good idea at the time  but it wasn’t This morning my manager questioned me on why I thought it was a good idea to close the store rather than call her  I froze  I couldn’t speak  I have social anxiety and when I know I’m in deep sh t I can’t talk She told me I should’ve called her  or why I didn’t as I had recently talked on the phone with her an hour ago and that we’d both be getting written up due to what we did What I did was stupid  and I feel really bad because it was my idea  I feel like I don’t have a good relationship with my manager and it doesn’t help when I do stupid things and make it worse,1433,285

845,i4d2wg,1,5,I Know You Can Read The Sign I’m out of work rn because my indoor mall in CA in temporarily closed  but a few posts on this thread reminded me of this My store has two entrances  both with gates that close from top to bottom  Corporate is insisting we keep both entrances open  use Gate  as an entrance exit so the metering associate can keep a headcount  use Gate  so customers can window shop while they’re in line  They gave us a flimsy ribbon to string across the second entrance to keep people out  and a tall sign that says in bold lettering on both sides “PLEASE USE OTHER ENTRANCE EXIT”In the short month we were reopened before getting shut down again I’ve witnessed the following happen at Gate    Multiple customers sneak under the ribbon to get inside the store without having to wait in line  Then complain and fight with staff when asked to leave and please wait in line    Customers approach the sign  take a moment to read it  look around  and proceed to duck under the ribbon to exit    Staff ask customers headed out Gate  to please use other exit  customers blatantly ignore staff or respond with something along the lines of “don’t tell me what to do”  Customers that waited in line will sneak multiple friends through Gate  once they’re inside so their friends don’t have to wait in line And my personal favorite       The ribbon is taped to two poles on either side of Gate   Seeing this  customers will karate chop the ribbon down during their exit so they don’t have to duck underneath  and then will leave the broken ribbon on the floor for the staff to reluctantly retape  Hoping corporate lets us keep Gate  closed when we reopen,1694,302
846,i40r7y,1,79,Customer complains about us not having enough of a product  but wont place an order  ShortI work at a smallish store thats basically for farmers  We have fencing and feed and stuff  This customer who Ive seen before several times comes in and asks me if weve gotten a pallet of rabbit feed in  thats  bags   lbs   I check with our receivers and they say that we dont have any in the back  I check in the spot on the floor and we have about  bags  Rabbit Guy says he needs a whole pallet since theres a   discount for  bags  He says he has been waiting for  months and we havent gotten it in and wants to know when its arriving  I explain to Rabbit Guy that the cashiers can see if its on order  but not what day it will arrive  I then tell him that he can place an order  A special order like this is held in the back and the customer is called when it arrives  The waiting time for special orders is   weeks  After I tell him this he just walks out of the store My main frustration is that we probably got  different pallets in the time that he was waiting and he just missed them being full  If he had placed an order before he needed them  we could have had it for him  and he wouldnt have needed to even pay in advance,1253,248
847,i3vy5n,1,23,She needs to apologize   Mere hours ago  I had just started my shift for the day and went to my stores front register  Not even  minutes in  and Ive encountered the first rude person of the day  Most arent reddit story worthy and I tend to brush things off  but this was something that made my coworkers laugh  On mobile so apologies for anything misspelled This older lady comes up and places her things on the counter  I barely get a  hello  in before Im cut off and it begins Me   myself  C   older lady  M   managerC   places our stores brand of allergy medication on the counter   boxes to be precise   you all normally give me   off on this   As she holds up one Me  unsure as to what she is referring to  pardon  C   you  all   raising her voice  give me   off on this Me  still visibly confused  is there something wrong with the packaging  I dont see a sticker on it for a markdown C   no  Its buy one get one half off  Me  finally understands what she is referring to  ok  did you not want to get a fourth to complete the two buy one get one half offs or were there no more of the size you were looking for   Need to ask  cant just give out discounts on a whim C   I dont want any more than these three  You never have enough on the shelves  Well that answered bothy concerns  She didnt want to mix and match  and it seems like we might not have any others on the shelf from her choice of words Change the price of the cheapest not coming up with the half off already and applied the    ring up her other items  asked is she wanted to use her saved up store currency  she paid and the receipt printed C   was that the total after the senior discount   That was today  The days just blur together  especially as of lately I even told her the total as she was watching the screen  not sure as to why she didnt say anything  before  she paid Me   ah  sorry maam  I didnt even realize that was today  Let me call up a manager to post void this and Ill re ring everything  It will only be a moment longer  As I call the manager  I can see as she rolls her eyes in quite a large ark and huffs every other second  Manager comes up  voids it  I re ring all the items by typing in the upcs on the receipt instead on unbagging everything  change the price once more  apply the discount  use her currency once again  and a good   off  She pays for it and leaves Paid it no mind  rang up other customers happily and didnt think anything about how snippy she was Until she called Maybe an hour later is when it rang  I answered the phone  cheerfully recited the company words and then recognized her voice immediately C    let me speak to the manager  Responded politely and placed her on hold  paged for an available manager to answer the call and went right on back to working the register From maybe   feet away  I can see the manager pick up the phone  Couldnt make out words but after long periods of silence the managers responses sound like a mixture of cheeriness  direct  and also a little snippy  A few minutes pass of what seemed like them going back and forth  the manager hangs up the phone and walks off  Didnt want to ask what all that was about and minded my own business without question  It wasnt until I called for something at the register that she turned around and started to inform me of the call  without even being questioned about it M   so you know that call that came in a little while ago  Me   yes  it was the lady I helped earlier  Let me guess  it was a complaint on me wasnt it M   you are correct  The manager went on by saying how the lady had started off the complaint that I was unbelievably rude to her  and she demanded that I apologise to her and that I need to be reprimanded for my behavior  Not once did I raise my voice or go anywhere from a cheerful tone  However  the manager had told the lady that she did not believe her complaint  that she couldnt see me being rude or that I had to give an apology in the first place when she knows I did nothing wrong The customer didnt tell her anything about the transaction  so when I explained what exactly happened  my minor mistake at the end with the senior discount for the first transaction  and the customers responses attitude to things  it just got the manager laughing  And the assistant store manager behind her was laughing as well They both agreed that nothing in there showing that I behaved as she had stated  But I am expecting her to call the corporate number and we might need to speak with the district manager,4614,835
848,i3s76d,1,6,Its always an eventful night on the graveyard shift This happened a couple years ago when I was the main graveyard shift manager at my pharmacy retail store  We normally have a security guard during this shift because    our store was in a crime filled city and    lots of people tweaked out on meth  heroin  etc  liked to come in and steal or threaten to hurt us during this time of night  The guard on shift this particular night was new to our store and I had been communicating with him the codes we have  our routines  and pointing out any regular thieves that came into the store  It was during one of these conversations I was having with him that I noticed a woman come inside the store  She looked extremely familiar  but I could not remember whether I knew her because she stole or because of something else  We both decide to watch from afar to see if she was stealing  The woman had walked down an aisle that held all of our seasonal summer items like pool toys  sandals  and sundresses  We kept watching from a good distance away  but then I turned my head to answer a question the guard had  When I turned my head back to look at what the woman was doing  she was wearing one of our sundresses and was proceeding to take her pants off underneath the dress  I was a little shocked at what I was seeing and it took a second before I yelled out  HEY   The woman now had taken her pants off and was trying to reach the front door to leave  The guard stopped her by blocking her path  which he technically wasnt supposed to do according to store policy  and demanding that she take the dress off immediately  She starts screaming obscenities at him but the guard doesnt budge  I call  because it looks like the woman is going to start assaulting the guard  She is screaming so loudly that the dispatcher can hear her through the phone over my voice  While waiting for police to come  the woman decides to give the dress back since the guard still isnt budging and letting her leave Now during this whole time weve dealt with this crazy woman  one of my coworkers had been outside taking a smoke break  He walked inside the store just as this woman was attempting to put her pants back on underneath the dress  She then throws the dress down onto the floor and then proceeds to take her shoes off and hurl them several aisles over  She then leaves barefooted and still screaming random obscenities out into the night  Police showed up not long after  but the lady was already gone Afterwards the coworker who was on a smoke break comes up to me and tells me that he got a full view of the womans   lady parts   as she was putting on her pants  Turns out the woman was going commando  It didnt phase him though  he previously worked at an adult store  and got a good laugh out of it  And before anyone asks  we did NOT keep the dress she wore  We just took inventory of it so that it could be thrown out for sanitary purposes  The woman had come in before to steal  which I remembered after this ordeal unfortunately  but she never did anything that crazy up until that point  She came in multiple times afterward  but I can leave that for another post if anybody is interested,3207,590
849,i3qs1l,1,24,“You need to go back to elementary school ” The other day I was working the closing shift  so  to   pm  Our store closes at  but of course people LOVE coming in at the very last second  My last customer came up to my register and I did the usual “How are you today  Would you like all your items in a bag ”  I scan her items and tell her the total  I ask her for cash or card and she went with cash  Now  I will be the first to tell you that math is not my strongest subject  Yes I’m  years old and yes I still need to use a calculator for most things  So I whipped out my calculator and just subtracted the total from what she gave me and didn’t pay too much attention to the numbers because I knew the calculator would get it right  I then hear her say something about  cents  I look up at her ask her to repeat herself and she goes on to say “My change back is  cents  You had to use a calculator for that    ” And I was just like “oh ok  yeah  cents”  that’s also what the calculator said   I continued to get the change while she began to say “WOW that is pathetic  You really have to use a calculator for THAT    I’m a teacher and that is so sad  You really need to go back to elementary school  that is PATHETIC ”  I just gave her the change and said have a good night  I think she was having a bad day and for some reason felt that belittling me would make her feel better,1394,285
850,i3pvus,1,2,Angry Potatoes Lady before i get into it  here’s our cast  RC   Rude Customer    FC   Friendly Customer  RC’s friend     CSL   Customer Service guy    Me   me   FM   Front End Manager  only mentioned   OM   Other Manager mentioned cuz I don’t really know what part she’s the manager for   For a bit of backstory  it was pretty early in my time as a cashier  so I was still learning how to do certain things and what I was allowed to do by myself and what I wasn’t  So anyway these two elderly ladies  RC and FC came in through my line and RC sets her stuff down on the belt and a couple other things on the counter with a slip for a rain check  I don’t really know how many stores actually do rain checks  but basically they’re just slips of paper that we give the customer if we don’t have something that’s marked down for that week that they want in stock and then they can come in and get that thing for the price on the slip whenever we do get it back in stock  Anyway  as I’m ringing up RC’s stuff  her potatoes end up coming up as the wrong price on the screen  She points it out in a fairly rude tone  but I say nothing and call someone up  We were pretty busy from what I saw  at least mine and a few other lines  including self checkout  so it took CSL a bit longer to get over to me cuz he had a bunch of other stuff he had to do  so I just continued ringing RC out until he came over  In the midst of me ringing out the other groceries RC had  she let out one of those really annoyed sighs that sound like you have something in your throat  looks around and then at me and says “Can’t you call over FM or OM ” I was just barely clocked in  I didn’t even know if either of them were that day  so I just shrugged and said “I don’t know  I just got here ” Her friend  FC  told her to calm down cuz I had my “I need help” light on  A few moments later  CSL walks over and asks what was wrong  I told him the potatoes came up as the wrong price and didn’t know how to change it  As CSL is voiding off the potatoes  RC asks him “Isn’t FM here ” He says “No  she just left about an hour ago ” “Well what about OM ” “I don’t know if she’s working today  I haven’t seen her ” to which RC replies with “Well is there anyone here who knows what they’re doing ” And CSL just goes quiet and fixes the price on the potatoes  I then tell him  I still need him cuz I have a rain check for RC  so since I didn’t know if I was allowed to register rain checks into my computer or not  nor did I now HOW to yet  he took the slip and the minced garlic and typed it in as a rain check  Everything went fairly smoothly after that  I rang out FC and they paid and left  though CSL was obviously very hurt about RC saying he didn’t know what he was doing  especially since you don’t just become CSLs for not knowing how to do the job and at one point RC came back through a different day and said “I’m not going through HERE” as if I did something wrong when literally all I was doing was what I was told to do by the people who trained me  I have a few more if anyone wants to actually hear them  but they’re WAY shorter  so if I do end up posting them  they’ll prolly be put into one post,3180,656
851,i3c72s,1,30,A Random Act of Kindness So  my last night at the store  I had two customers in at the same time  This woman came in and was getting water  Gatorade  Powerade  stomach medicine  and was on the phone with someone explaining that our store does not carry baby aspirin  She waved the customer behind her to go ahead and explained that she had to find a substitute  because no one else was open that time of night  true  The customer behind her  a man  looked at her items as he handed me his items  two  oz beers  and told me  quietly  to ring up her items as well  So I did  and he paid for it  Then  after I bagged his beers and handed them over he asked me to print a receipt for the paid items and put it with them after I had bagged them  Which I did  He walked off as I was bagging the items She came up to me  flustered  and said   He said he paid  For my stuff   As I was showing her the receipt he left the store   But  but why  I shrugged   I dont know   I said honestly   Its not like he  told  me why  after all    But  if you see him again  you should say thank you  Were you able to find the medications all right  This may be short  but I thought it was too good not to share  People  can  be nice and considerate towards each other  and I think that sometimes we just need a reminder of that,1322,257

855,i2usvk,1,54,Yell at me  no refund for you  This is my first post in Reddit so hopefully this is the right place Also English is my secondary language and Im on mobile  and Id classify this as long  so  sorry   Ok so  I work in a pretty popular online shopping store as a customer consultant service  one that shall not be named  Now  this really happens to all of us  almost daily  but this one I had just yesterday and I think its worth a share Whenever someone orders something and doesnt get it or returns it  of course theyll get a refund  No matter how rude they are  its their money after all  This one was a special case though CS   CustomerMe   me  A customer calls and I start with the basic  Hello and welcome to Blah  my name is Blah  what can i do for you    and without even finishing the sentence  the CS goes yelling  WHY HAVENT I GOTTEN MY MONEY BACK YET   ITS BEEN SO LONG YADA YADA YADA   Im used to these customers but I get so angry every time  I keep my cool tho  and I go to the order to check why he hasnt gotten his refund yet  While checking  I saw that he returned the item almost  weeks ago  it takes  week  seldom  to get a refund   and that this was the fourth time he called us about this  the colleagues always told him to wait and be patient and so on  I thought  Okay  Id also be a tad angry with this   but then while checking  I noticed that he paid with Coupons  Alrighttttt  Side note   coupons here are given either with special offers  buy  EUR of this  get  EUR coupon   either  usually  theyd be given to the customers from the customer service  us  as a way of apology or compensation when a package is delivered late or badly  or in general about other problems  and coupons can only be used one time and they are non refundable  since theyre considered as a discount for future orders  We also have a way of checking how it was given to them  I dont know why the colleagues kept telling him to wait  They either did not see that it was a coupon  or were avoiding confrontation  I inform the CS that he paid with coupons  and since theyre for single uses  he will get no refund  I explain it pretty politely and clearly  He doesnt understand  I tell him that since its a coupon and it counts as a discount  the item is considered to be a  gift  of some sort  Since he technically did not pay for it  he wont get money from us  After a lot of explaining and him yelling at me the whole goddamn time  he probably ran out of excuses as I explained the gist of it numerous times  he said something along the lines of  I have no idea what these even are  This is the first time Ive heard of a Coupon   Bad move  bro  I checked to see how he got the coupons and all of them were given to him from the Customer Service  and were obligated to send a confirmation email each time  so I knew this was a straight up lie  He just desperately wanted those   EUR from us  I proceed to inform him this  and told him that I have numerous  confirmation emails in front of me  and I can gladly send them again for him to see  He pretends its a misunderstanding and that he knows what the Coupons are now  Sure  Thing is  I now notice that the CS was actually abusing the system  so to speak  as hed call for extremely minor inconveniences  and ask for a coupon from us as compensation for the trouble  Things like  Why is this particular thing in your website so hard to find  The customer should have it easy  I demand a compensation    We always leave notes after every call and say what the call was about  so I was reading the notes my colleagues left from previous calls  I was smelling a Karen  Except it was a man  A Bob  Anyways  I was getting tired of repeating the same things so I basically told him that we can talk all day but theres nothing I can so as the system wont allow it  Sure enough that shuts him up and we end the convo  Since he was abusing the system and customer service  I proceeded to report him to my superiors for this  which meant no coupons anymore  and we were allowed to hang up if he wouldnt cooperate   Normally the client has to hang up  we have this dumb  Disconnect Rate  that we have to take care of   Furthermore  I actually COULD make an exception and just put another Coupon on his account on that same value  but he yelled at me all the time  so of course he wasnt getting it  The CS wouldnt know this  but I did and it gave me a lot of satisfaction  Basically  whether we  refunded  the coupon or not was entirely our decision  and it was kind of an unwritten rule to  refund  it if the customer is nice and genuinely made a mistake didnt see it  but if theyre bitchy or Karen y to us  wed give them the good ol  Im sorry  the system wont allow it   Moral of the story  be nice to customer service,4817,917
856,i2db7y,1,13,Angry Customer Spills His Tools Everywhere  So just for some clarification for those who haven’t read some of my posts  I work for a store that is under a multi store ownership  Our other store sells building material  and often customers will request it to be shipped to our store for easier pick up  During the height of the lockdown that went on in my area  a contractor who we don’t like because he is arrogant and rude came in  saying he got a call some material he ordered arrived  We look through our whole receiving area  and found nothing  At this point  the customer is getting rather angry  saying he got a call from us saying it is here  We go around  asking every staff member if they saw the other store come by  and drop the material off  Everyone said they never even saw the other store arrive  So my manager tells the guy to wait in his vehicle  and he’ll make some calls to figure out what is going on  The guy is spewing  saying we don’t know how to do our jobs  and stuff like that with the usual rant  I see the guy angrily stomp back to his truck after his rant  Since it was close to us to close  I go outside to put stuff away  The whole time  I see the guy angrily stomping around his truck  slamming doors and the tailgate of his truck  After several minutes of observing his fits of rage  I see him get back into his truck  turns it on with the tailgate open  and a open toolbox resting on the back  He then hits the gas hard  and speeds out of his parking spot  going for the exit  But his tool box slid off the back  and slammed onto the ground  spilling his tools everywhere  I bit my tongue trying not to laugh as I see him stomp out of his truck  and go back to collect his fallen tools  Just as he finished and got back in  that’s was when my manager came out  and walked up to the driver side window  I see him talk to the guy for a moment  then I see the guy give a similar hand gesture like you give when you saw screw you to someone  and then he speeds out of the parking lot  So my manager comes over  chuckling  and ask him what went on  He told me his material did arrive  but it arrived at the other store  which is who phoned him  And they didn’t send it over because he never asked to have it brought over   So a few days later  I talked to a coworker from the other store  and this person dealt directly with the contractor  They told me he was nice and sweet on the phone  when he was asking about why his material wasn’t sent to our store  My coworker is not one to tolerate much  so they told him he never asked it to be sent  that they discussed if it could be sent over  but he never said yes do it  They then told me when they said they would send it over  my coworker told them “You better be nicer to the workers at the other store when you get it ” He asked “What do you mean ” My coworker replied “Because I heard how rude and disrespectful you were to them for something that wasn’t their fault  If I hear you treat them similarly like that again  we aren’t gonna bother ordering anything for you again ” He goes “Well  I’m under a lot of stress with this job  trying to get it done ” My coworker replied “That’s no excuse to treat them the way you did  So treat them better  or don’t shop with us at all ” So his material did arrive  and when he came to pick it up  let’s just say he miscommunicated how much he actually wanted  We could see his face turning red with anger during that time  but it was funny watching him trying to keep his rage under control  Hope that gave everyone a good laugh  I laughed a lot witnessing it,3610,701

859,i27vr9,1,14,yo goes from hyper and happy to destructive in  seconds flat i used to work in a little hardware store that had a cutesy pet aisle  For some stupid reason we kept the ceramic dog dishes on the bottom most shelves  Cuz you know   thats a safe place for them  One day   around noon a family comes down there to check out the aisle nearby with camping  fishing and hunting gear  This adorable  yo is running just in front of the parents and the parents are keeping a close eye on them   I was cool with it   because its not busy in that department on most days and  so far the toddler was just burning off some energy  Then you see the switch   Its instantaneous   The kid goes from happy hyper to overtired in a blink   Suddenly the  yo isnt listening to mom and dad any more   I was nearby and had a premonition immediately   The toddler suddenly is running into the dog aisle touching everything and getting mad mom and dad wont let them touch or take anything  Mom and dad start to rush toward the yo to grab them up   I think they saw what i saw   White   ceramic dog bowls sitting pretty on the bottom shelf and kid was gunning for it    I was less than  feet from the dog bowls   but toddlers are stupid fast   I reached   they reached calling the kid to stop   the toddler reaches and wins  They snatched up a dog bowl   quick as lightning glances back to incoming parents whore almost on top of the child trying to grab the bowl back  I put my arm out to try to snag it from the toddler when   I  can see it   that split decision  YEEET  Smash goes the dog bowl  The kid is already in parents arms when it lands  The mortified look on their faces  White to red in seconds   They immediately begin apologizing and offering to pay for it   Scolding their child in between   I was understanding of course   Told them Its no big deal   The dog dish shouldnt be where little hands can grab anyway  I told them to not worry about it   just make sure the little one isnt hurt  And Ill just claim it slipped from the shelf and shattered   I waved them off   they rushed red faced to check out and i cleaned the mess  I have my own toddler now in her threenage moments and i understand even more now   You can be the best parent in the world   but that wont stop a toddler from anything really,2323,468
860,i22345,1,3,The Change Man cometh Reading these posts has reminded me of something that happened to me years ago when I was a cashier at a gas station  auto parts store on a military base  We had one guy who would come in almost every day and give us a handful of change to buy gas  He drove a big old car  one of those ones that were made back when Detroit was king and got  gallons to the mile   and rarely got more than    in gas  Even though it was years ago and you paid less for gas on a military base  that still wasnt even  gallons of gas So every time he pulled in we rolled our eyes  Wed end up having to take time to count his pennies and nickels and set the prepay amount for him  holding up the line  and he always came in after work  when we were at our busiest   Other than the  month deployment he went on in the middle  this went on for more than  months  He never said anything  just came in and told us the pump number and put his change on the counter for us to count One day things were really jumping  It was pay day  it was close to a holiday  and there was a hurricane heading towards us  In the middle of a serious rush and watching anxiously for the gas truck  we were almost out of regular   we saw the big green boat that was his vehicle pull up to a pump  We sighed  knowing what was coming  But right behind him came the gas truck  Due to the age of the tanks  amp  pumps  we couldnt have anyone pumping while the gas truck delivered  and all of our regulars knew it  so they either pumped fast and left or prepared to wait  minutes or so  Change guy wasnt aware  so he came in to prepay and handed me a   bill  I was so shocked I almost dropped it  I said Id set it up  but that he would have to wait  and explained why  He responded  super quietly  almost a whisper  that that was okay  he could wait  He just needed to get on the road soon  Oh   I said   Trying to outrun the hurricane   No   he said  shaking his head   My mamas sick  Ive been sending her most of my paycheck to pay for her doctors  but its not doing much good  Ive gotta get home and take care of my sisters while shes in the hospital  I just hope this   worth of gas is enough to get me there  Yall  my heart broke  I gave him back his   and told him I would pay  he should keep it for a fill up on the way  He thanked me and went outside  we always went outside and yelled out when people could start filling  so he was going to wait for that   When I turned around the other two women at the register held out   and told me to let him fill up and we could split the change  We never saw him again after that  I hope his mom was okay TL DR  I get my comeuppance when an annoying customer turns out to be a hero,2742,548
861,i207he,1,22,Put it on ours   I work at a grocery store  and I was just getting done  I only had one item  a sweet tea   and joined the line  still in my uniform Both of my coworkers had long lines  and  everybody  had a full cart   and they are newer  so I knew itd be a bit of a wait  The lady in front of me sees I only have one item  and insists I go ahead  The lady in front of her is already unloaded  but sees my one item  and again insists I jump ahead of her  The couple in front of her are just finishing up  and spot me  and ask that I put my tea down  and theyll get it for me  I try to refuse a few times  but they tell me  honey  you earned it  you look like you had a long day  well get it for you   So they paid for my tea  Im still floating on air from these interactions  I love my customers,808,170
862,i1z1uv,1,115,Seriously  just hand me the change I just remembered this story of my time working as a cashier  It was a fairly average day  not too busy or slow   A pair came through my line  a middle aged woman  and a younger woman who Im assuming was her daughter   The two separate their items and I ring up the older woman first   It goes pretty standard until it comes time to pay   I hold out my hand for her to hand me her cash  but instead of giving me her money she drops it on the belt  activating the sensor and causing me to scramble for it before its dragged under   Luckily I managed to get it all in time but Im pretty annoyed now   So when I give the older woman her change I set it on the counter instead of handing it to her   She tuts but steps back   Her daughter steps up and I start ringing out her order   When its time to pay she hands me the money and I return the favor   This causes the older woman to tut again  and say to her daughter   oh he must really like you   Loud enough for me to hear  Later in the day my manager talks to me about a complaint I got because I  threw someones change on the counter,1129,234
864,i1ob1i,1,1,Customer goes silent after I show him our prices compared to buying prices  Many of my stories take place in my stores old location    INCLUDING THIS ONE Like many of my stories  just heard of the store  boxed up as much stuff to sell to my store  laser focused on getting cash and not store credit because doesnt care about what is on our shelves  Nothing wrong with that last one  but we cant do as much in cash So one day it was a typical slow day and we were doing inventory  Person comes in with a Playstation  and his whole collection  Well his collection included the common PS games  MGS  Ace Combat   and sports games   Literally nothing stood out  The PS he brought had a lot of wear and read disc very slowly  like from the menu to start the game  and of course discs were scratched For the life of me I cant remember what was the total value we offered him  He was dead set on getting cash though  I remember he specifically got his ace combat  and said we were going to sell it for  dollars  that one I do remember specifically  We were offering him  dollars  I went to our shelf and showed him we sold it for    He showed me many other games claiming similar and since they were all common fodder we sold all of them for less than  dollars  He eventually after showing he cant talk down to me from a position of authority just said  I am not recommending this store to anyone  and didnt say anything afterwards,1451,272
865,i19d2b,1,52,Sir  we can’t set a tent up on a BRICK PATIO So some background  I work for a rental company that setups and delivers tables chairs and tents as well as miscellaneous party stuff  Never in my  years working for the company have I came across an issue such as this   Is also like to note we are under new management because of my old boss getting fired  long story  can repost if anyone wants to hear it  On our contracts  we specifically state that our canopies go up on grass specifically because we have to put in stakes about   feet into the ground after the tent is laid out  We go to the guys house  the guy has a brick patio but we then tell him we can setup the tent because ya know  the stakes hold up the tent  he freaks out and calls my new boss blaming her when  literally he came to the shop and acknowledged the contracts terms and agreements which he signed  Tells her names I won’t say on reddit for protection sakes and me not wanting to get subreddit banned but they were not nice things to say the least  After much heated argueing  our boss calls and tells the guys who are setting up the tent to go back and grab a frame tent and water barrels  another type of tent we offer  basically the tent we setup but on top of a frame and is secured by water barrels   after they setup the frame tent  to the guys credit  he does tip them graciously among three guys    each   and they go on their way  Goes to show that sometimes the customer is not always right,1487,286
866,i0fk9y,1,81,the largest sale i’ve witnessed yet  im on mobile so i apologize if the formatting gets messed up   i work at a chain clothing retailer and our company’s major focus is caring for the customer and doing our absolute best to assist and help them  one of my managers did an incredible job of doing that today  a mother and daughter came in looking for some new clothes for the daughter who is a first year college student  she’s moving into her dorm pretty soon and wanted to get some new clothes for college  they had never shopped with us before and weren’t aware of how our sizing works or how our clothes fit so my manager helped them every step of the way  she pulled items from clearance and regular price that spanned almost every category of what we sell  tshirts  workwear  camis  kimonos  dresses  shorts  jeans  leggings  shoes  belts  and intimates  she piled everything up that they liked and put it behind the registers  when they were done  she went through every single item with them to discuss how they felt about it and confirm if they wanted it or not  it took three of us  my manager  myself  and a new employee that i was training  to ring them out  the new employee de censored and my manager scanned items before handing them to me so i could bag them  after everything was said and done  my manager made a    sale  it’s the largest single sale i’ve ever seen anyone make in my  months of working there  it might not seem like much but it’s really exciting to me to see my coworkers who i adore so much make great sales and give customers a wonderful experience  our customers expressed that my managers help made their shopping experience so much better and easier  our team let our district manager know about it and she then emailed the story to other stores in our district  it’s also nice to have a good experience like this to reflect on during these times  we all know us retail workers are stretched pretty thin right now and have more negative customer stories than we can count since returning to work  at least in America   it’s days like these that make it all worth it  i love my team and our customers,2154,391

871,hz937j,1,14,Theres A Gate For A Reason I was on a piece of lift equipment today packing out a couple of bays  which happened to be the last two bays of the aisle for me  The machine was about a foot away from the gate  and I was facing the opposite way  I hear the gate chain rattling  and next thing I know a woman comes walking in the aisle She never acknowledged me or said anything  and starts reaching right under where the machine is raised  so I looked at her and said “You know  there’s a gate there for a reason ” She  finally  just looked at me like I was an idiot so I continued and said “I can’t have you in the aisle while I’m on this which is why it’s blocked off but if you give me about  seconds I can come down and you can get what you need ”She didn’t like that  She shouts “You don’t have to be a                           about it ” and leaves the aisle  slamming the gate as hard as she could  I could hear her going off about how I was a “                         ” to whomever she was with and how rude I was  I moved forward a couple bays and came down  but she never came in the aisle so I guess she left In my three years of working with this company  and eight years working in general  no customer has ever called me that  I’m not even mad that she said that   I feel like it’s more a badge of honor than something that’s supposed to offend me honestly   I’m just appalled at how stupid people can be   even though I should know by now  Just like I told her  there’s literally a gate for a reason  so why would you go in the aisle with a machine a foot away   feet in the air  If I hadn’t heard the gate  I  easily could have backed into her since I wasn’t facing that way  or dropped something on accident  so I don’t know why she had to get so defensive about it,1792,357

886,hwnswo,1,169,Threatened a yof because his order had burnt in a warehouse fire  Hello  i thought Id share a tale from my first ever job  Im on mobile and English is my first  and only  sorry  language  The title is pretty much it tbh I used to work at a now shut homebase store in the UK  I worked up from a check out chick to staffing the customer service desk  I started at  years and quickly rose up  The day before this happened we had been informed that one of the warehouses that made and shipped new kitchens had been set on fire by accident by a group of kids messing around in it after finding a broken door that didnt lock properly  Unfortunately the fire killed  of the kids and seriously injured the rest of the kids  Starting a fire in a wood and chemical filled warehouse was a terrible idea but they were kids and didnt deserve that end and nightmares An email had gone out to people who had ordered a kitchen from us explaining that there was going to be a delay and they can wait or get a full refund and a   voucher I had been inundated with calls and people coming in asking for refunds and such in various degrees of anger but one stood out I had just swapped a screwdriver for someone who had gotten the wrong one  The old one was still on the desk when our protagonist turns up Cast Me me  C  Customer Me   hello  how can I           C   what has happened to my fucking kitchen Me   ah sir Im afraid that a fire in the warehouse has caused us to loose the entire stock of kitchens and      C   I dont fucking care what happened to your fucking warehouse  I want my kitchen Ive been waiting for weeks Me   please dont swear at me sir  C   I will do what I like  I want my kitchen  now Me   unfortunately sir due to the fire the kitchens will not be          This man just could not let me finish a sentence it seemed C   you dont listen do you  I want my kitchenMe   Sir     At this point the customer hit his limit of sanity  He grabbed the screwdriver and started waving it at me  Luckily the desk was quiet high at about chest height and big enough to have  people work in the box without too much difficulty so I was able to back away from the mad man He was shouting at me at this point but I cannot tell you what he was shouting as I was just watching the screwdriver trying to not get stabbed  What our irate customer didnt know was that this store had a security guard  Steve  who was short  muscular  permanently angry and was a good friend of mine from all the time he spent leaning on the desk pretending to work  Steve had been watching from the other end of the line of checkouts where he was stood next to the exit to the shop At seeing the guy pick up the screwdriver Steve started sprinting towards us and fully flying rugby tackled the customer around the middle and to the ground slamming his head into the concrete floor  The customer dropped the weapon and Steve dragged him out of the shop and sat on him till the police arrived  It was when the police watched the cameras that i could see the flying tackle in all its glory  Steve was very proud of that take down  I think the customer did get his refund but I dont think he got the   discount voucher that others were offered,3269,614
887,hwh3w1,1,80,Tiny thieves After reading a very recent post about a kid stealing some white chocolate kit Kats and eating them in the bathroom  it reminded me of the one time kids tried to steal from my job but got caught  Years later  this story is still very strong in my memory and thought it would be time to write it out  Dont remember many of the words used  but I do remember the sequence things went in and what the conversations entailed About   years ago one evening  it was somewhat close to closing time  I was doing the closing duties which involved alot of cleaning  and just so happened to be cleaning the bathrooms at the time  Normally I keep the cleaning cart outside the door  blocking it  because its a little too big to bring in  So every now and then I would need to open the door to the hallway to get a different cleaner Two little girls  sisters  stood in the hallway  A younger Id say about  or   and the older maybe  or   were waiting by my cart  I politely told them  and apologized  that the bathrooms were currently closed but should be open again in a few minutes  I had just sprayed cleaner on everything  They scurried away and I went back inside and quickly finished When I came out  they at first werent there  It wasnt until I pushed the cart over to the mens restroom and cleaned a little in there before coming out to swap cleaners  that i caught the back of the older sister running into the bathroom  Few minutes pass again  finish with the mens restroom  and push the cart to the back to tidy up and throw out the trash bags My manager had come in and asked me if I had cleaned the restrooms yet  and when I replied yes  she made the follow me hand motion and we went towards the front of the store  On the way up  she faced me and was walking backwards as she explained quietly that she found boxes of empty toys in one of the tiny trashcan located within the stall  and asked if I had changed them out  I told her I did but did see the two little girls go in and described what they looked like Upon getting to the front of the store  I was told to monitor the little girls through the mirror on the back wall  who were still in the toy isle   while the manager told the cashier up front about the situation and to notify her when their guardian came up  Didnt have to wait long because only a few seconds later their grandmother came up with some medication followed by the two little girls  who were empty handed Once she was checking out  my manager came up and asked if the grandmother would like to add the toys to the transaction  Of course the grandmother had no idea what she was talking about  so the manager removed box after box from the bag and placed them on the counter  The two little girls were trying so hard to act like theyve never seen those before  So grandma stared at the boxes  looked at the kids  and started yelling  They both start tearing up and remove the toys from their pockets  Whatever is in those little blind box num noms  I assume chapstick at the time  Just kept unloading them onto the counter The grandmother was so mad  yelling that this wasnt how their family has raised them  said she would be back to purchase  and stormed out with the kids  She then came back in after minute  paid for everything including the toys  but said we could keep them in the store because she was not going to be rewarding their behavior  Profusely apologized and left  I was talking with the cashier  telling her about everything leading up to this  all she was told was to look out for the family with two little girls because of a theft   Next thing we know  we hear crying  And its getting louder The grandmother walks in practically dragging the younger one who is just nothing but tears and a red face  They come back up    with a num noms toy   and its not broken into  She pays for the toy  hands it to the little girl  and leaves with the child all without a word When I asked my manager later that night how exactly she found the empty packages  she said that she noticed the little girls run out from the bathrooms hallway and had a small feeling to go check  Noticed I wasnt in the hallway anymore  and went into the bathroom  The stall trashcan was not only stuffed with them  but overflowing too  We are talking maybe   boxes  and theyre pretty decently sized,4369,806

890,hvfd3b,1,166,The Bathrooms Have To Be Along The Back Wall   Happened earlier today  still pretty miffed about it I work in the back room receiving area of a large store whos building is older than I am  Anyway  there is a gate that normally goes across this back area blocking it off from the rest of the store with a sign on it saying   Employees Only Beyond This Point   This is a nice thing to have as it allows me to do my work without being bothered by customers with questions  since I dont know much about our stock other than how much of it we have or when the next shipment is due  But unfortunately  most of my fellow employees dont understand it  and constantly leave it open when they come through  usually to just throw away trash  I am pretty tired of having to shut it at least  times an hour and sometimes just let it stay open Today  an older gentleman comes into the back while I am working  and just stands there  huffing to himself  Normally  I try to help out lost customers the best I can  but this guy just marched himself back there  into an area that is clearly different from the rest of the store and stood there  wrists on his hips and a pissed look in his eyes  so I pretend like I didnt see him and got back to work Just my luck  he doesnt take the cue and walks right up to me and huffs in the most perturbed voice I have heard from a customer thus far   Hey  where are your bathrooms   I  already having a bad day as we are slammed with freight and the night crew left half of their work laying about in my area  look at him and answer   Other side of the store  sir   I just came from there   he huffs louder at me   and they are most certainly arent there  Me  still not caring enough to deal with him   I am sorry  sir  but I know they are  They are between Electronics and the outside retail doors    crosses arms and narrows his eyes at me    I didnt see them  I went up and down the back wall and its not there  I sigh as I realize whats going on  I have to answer this same question daily   The bathrooms arent along the back wall  its on the side wall  But still on the other side of the store  He then goes into a mini tirade about how there should have been a sign  there are  and they are bigger than me  and how all bathrooms should be along the back wall Me  now getting pissed   Sir  its not on the back wall and cant be on the back wall   Why not   Because neither I  nor you  where here when the building plans were being drawn up  Now  if you want the restrooms  they are on the other side of the building  He starts huffing and trying to say something further but I cut him off   Sir  if you want I can show you to the bathroom   He scowls at me  but agrees  I walk him towards the rest of the store and point above the racking at the ceiling on the other end of the building   Can you see the bathroom sign  sir   Yes  finally   he huffs once more  Good   I say as he gets to the other side of where the gate goes  and I slam it close   You can handle the rest from here   I cant say what his face was like after that as I turned on my heels and returned to work  but I do know he stood there for a hot second before stomping off towards the bathrooms,3235,615
891,hv7t2e,1,8,The confused shoplifter Saw a post about a dumb shoplifter and it inspired me to tell this story While I was working on my degree  I worked at a gas station to make ends meet  This gas station was in a pretty low income part of town  Not dangerous  just full of    interesting people I should add that I hated my job  They were greedy  and didnt care about their employees at all  we were expendable  For example  I got robbed while working there and was assaulted in the process  Had a black eye and everything  I found out upper management specifically asked the police to investigate me for involvement  After having been there nearly a decade  in both management and regular positions  and never having had my till come up short  Really proved to me that I was just a warm body to them Anyways  I was working late shift one night  It was about a m  when this girl  probably late teens early s came in  She was obviously drunk  She was also the only person in the store  I saw her walk to the beer cooler and grab a couple of Mikes hard lemonades and then meander around the rest of the store  Lo and behold  she comes to the counter with a stick of gum and nothing else  Best part is  she didnt even hide the beer well  I could see it in the inside of her jacket  which was open  Me   Should I ring up the beer  too  Her   what beer  Me   those   pointing at the cans in her jacket She looks sheepish and takes them out of her pocket and sets them on the counter  apologizing Im thoroughly entertained at this point and chuckling  I tell her it was a good try  ring up her gum  and tell her the total  She obviously thought she was going to be in trouble so she looked really bewildered  I wasnt about to get this girl in legal trouble over a hilariously bad attempt at shoplifting  though  Hell  if it wasnt alcohol  I probably wouldnt have even stopped her  F    their profit margins Anyways  still looking confused af  she was like   so    am I in trouble  Me   I mean  youre not getting the beer  and you shouldnt steal  Her   So can I still come to the store  Or are you going to ban me  Me   Nah  just dont try to steal next time   Her   uh    okay  Sorry  again  She paid her    for her gum and left  still looking thoroughly confused  I spent the rest of the night laughing to myself over the whole interaction No big climax or crazy people  just a drunk girl being dumb and getting caught  It just still makes me laugh to this day  so I thought Id share  I have a lot more crazy  and more eventful  stories from my time in fast food and convenience stores that Ill share sometime  Just was reminded of this one today,2677,483

896,htqaak,1,386,I TOLD YOU that you DO sell them here   I used to work at a medium department store popular for its overpriced furniture  imported foreign food and candy  and wine selection  Our stores tend to attract a lot of   The customer is always right   types because most items are just on the cusp of  high end  retail  A customer walks in and wanders around the snack section for awhile before flagging me down  Customer   Yes  Im looking for these chocolate Italian bears    Me   Im sorry  Ive never heard of anything like that here    I should point out that Ive worked at this particular location for five years and was the head of the gourmet department so I did all the inventory and stocking by myself  I also have a huge sweet tooth so if something new comes in  I dont miss it    Customer   No  no  I bought it here last Christmas  I know you carry them  Theyre little chocolate bears in CLEAR cellophane wrapping   I ask her if she can remember any part of the name and shes stumped  but insists theyre here Im thinking it must be a Christmas exclusive item so I go to our Italian aisle in Christmas and start looking around and then back to our regular chocolate aisle  I suggest a few similar Italian chocolates  maybe she just meant there was a bear on the package because Baci does have a polar bear on some of their boxes and thats Italian   After thirty minutes  I give up and try to search keywords into our AS system  For those of you who were blessed to never deal with this system  its an archaic application used for inventory but you have to spell things EXACTLY in order or the system either spits out  retired SKUs or nothing at all  The customer is starting to get irate that Im trying to find the item in the computer and I can tell my actions of trying to go above and beyond are just annoying her because it doesnt look like Im physically doing anything  so I finally just tell her that it doesnt look like that particular item is in stock anymore She leaves back to the chocolate section and not even five minutes later  comes stomping back to the register waving a white and red box in the air  I FOUND IT  I TOLD YOU that you DO carry it   she says in this sing song smug as fuck voice I look at the box and reply   Maam  those arent chocolate bears  Theyre Happy Hippos  And theyre German   As much as Id love to tell you that she saw the error of her ways and apologized  she instead says   Well  you should have known what I meant  Edit  For people complaining that Kinder is Italian  in America  all imported items come with a fat paper label to give you the nutritional information in English  On any Kinder product  it says Product of Germany  In my store  items also have special labels on the shelf to say where it originates from  which ours says Germany and it is always grouped with the German candies  Kinder was also created in Frankfurt  Germany the year before it was introduced to Italy  Americans consider this a German product  so if you said Italian  youre not going to get what youre looking for unless youre specifically like   The ferrero brand   and even then  its going to take the cashier a moment to figure it out  Theres no giant logo aside from Kinder on the boxes   So yeah  made by an Italian company  but imported and made in Germany  Considered German here,3368,602

899,htacx1,1,25,Customer wants refund for   reward she got for free  This just happened an hour or so ago but it was so frustrating dealing with this fucking Karen So I work at a home goods store in the returns department  It’s my last customer of the night so of course she had to be difficult  Customer wants to return some items she paid for  okay no problem But then she shows me the receipt and I see that she used multiple   rewards that were given to her from her ‘Store Brand’ credit card  Problem is  these   rewards are a one time use and deducts a certain amount of cents from each item on the receipt so it’s not just one line item you can return  So if she bought something that was    the   reward only took off    or    depending on how many items she bought I try to explain this to her and say that the    reward is a one time use but she wasn’t buying it  It was so hard to explain to her that she wasn’t getting the reward money back and I could only refund what she spent by credit card  I ended up calling two managers over who debated with her back and forth for TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES  She got the reward for free  but she was acting like we were stealing from her  She kept saying she might as well burn up the reward paper she had with her  No matter what way we tried to explain it ‘you only get back what you paid for with your credit card’ ‘you didn’t pay for the   it was given to you as a reward’ ‘rewards are void after use’ she just WOULD NOT GET IT Eventually I got her to complete the return but she also tried to return some clearance items that we rejected straight away cause they were final sale  But JFC this lady just got on my motherfucking nerves,1703,331

901,ht98s6,1,9,A not so normal return I am putting my two weeks notice in tomorrow as I head off to college  This was my first retail job  and let me say  retail is a whole new breed of work  When I first entered the store  I was a timid sales clerk that stumbled through my sentences  Now  I am funny and love to interact with customers of all types   I look back at this one customer  and you know what  I realize that some people are a whole different type of shopper  To the story  I work at a retailer that supplies a lot of home appliances and furniture  We have some of the best customers I have ever worked with  and we pride ourselves on being customer friendly  I have only had a handful of customers that get on my nerves  but most of my customers are lovely people  We opened before a lot of other stores in our area  and we had a lot of people coming in and out  We were also one of the few stores accepting returns  Us associates have very strict instructions to follow with returns  and some customers get confused  amp  agitated with those instructions  Eventually  they get their money back  and we are able to quarantine those items  Most times  It was a sunny afternoon when I was working on the return desk  we had a specific register for returns at this time   The queue was rather thin  and the story was empty  I was one of two cashiers up there at the moment  and the other cashier was fetching a price check for something  The queue is set up where you have to go around a certain section to get to the front  The end of the queue is near the front of the store  so people typically realize they enter the wrong side of the queue and follow the directions on the floor  But  no  not this person Lets call him Richard  for obvious reasons  I am getting ready to help the next people in the queue when Richard storms in with two bags in his hands  He is agitated  a blind man could see it  He cuts through the queue  the wrong way  and slams his receipt on the table  Return these for me   His tone immediately sets me off  I couldnt tell if he didnt see the people standing right there  or if he innocently went the wrong way  Sir  there is the queue  you came in the      No  I didnt  Return them  now   I was taken aback by his tone  I would have thought he was joking  honest to god  But  no  This guy was furious  for no reason  Folks I will be right with you  okay   The two people in the queue nod and I get to work on the return  He proceeds to put the bag on the desk and a piece of torn off cardboard falls in my hands  The front of the tag is cut off  keep that in mind  I look at the first item and notice it is a set of bath mats  I look at the receipt on my screen  and it shows that there were two bathmats purchased  I look at the tag  as it is the one that goes to the mats  It clearly states that it is    The other purchased mats  that he didnt bring  are     Alright  sir  So this one will be refunded    If you could put your card in  it will go right back on there   Give that to me   he snaps as he takes my receipt  He then points at the    That is    I dont know what you are talking about  This is ridiculous   I give a small prayer up above before nodding and marking that return at    I wasnt going to fight him  As I am almost finished with that return  I notice he has a bag in his hand containing a small rug  Do you sell this here   I nod at him before he throws it on my counter  I look at the receipt and to the rug before realizing there is no way that this rug was on the receipt   Sir  I am afraid this rug is not on this receipt  There is not a tag on it either  However  if you give me a moment I can get you a price  I will need to see your drivers license   This is ridiculous  put it back on my damn card already  I dont have my license  why do you even need that   I take in a silent breath before excusing myself to get a price  I come back and notice him tapping his fingers on my desk  he is looking at his phone while muttering something under his breath  It is   sir  I need your drivers license through or I cant give you the return   I told you before  I dont have it   Then we cant take it   He snatches the rug away  but he leaves the bag on my desk  I say a small prayer before finishing the transaction  or so I thought  Sir  I am afraid we are unable to take the bag  It is for our safety        Why  Its your damn bag  Youre acting absolutely ridiculous at this point   I feel like the only work he knows is ridiculous  I start to get teary eyed as he continues to rant at me  The people in the queue feel bad  but no one bothers to say anything  Just return the damn r     I am going to get my manager   I am starting to cry at this point as I cant handle being yelled at  You dont have to cry just      I didnt hear him as I walked over to one of my managers and tell her that she can go deal with Richard  I am sobbing and take a moment in the break room  I never had a customer that angry before  After ten minutes  I composed myself and ignored my tear stained cheeks and bloodshot eyes  My manager asked me if I was alright  and I managed to choke out a yes  The rest of the customers that saw it apologized and asked if I was okay  I was My manager ended up giving me a small thing of candy as she felt bad  I never thought I would have to deal with that  and I pray he doesnt come back

902,ht3tlm,1,66,Sir  those break pads were installed upside down    This was probably  years ago at this point  but I worked at an auto parts store right out of technical college   We sold brake pads with a lifetime warranty   The warranty covers manufacturing issues as well as  long term wear  you wear those brake pads down from normal use   You can then buy new ones and bring back the old ones for the warranty  or  bring us the old ones and we can swap them out right there    What is  NOT covered is improper use  installing on something other than the  vehicle s  the pads were intended   modifications to the pads  or  as in  this case  improper installation  Cast   Mekanik   the  mechanic  guy who purchased and apparently installed the pads  Me   yours truly   Boss   my boss  duh   CW   my coworker who was a master mechanic at a car company with a blue  logo before a motorcycle accident prevented him from actually working on cars anymore   I say that all because hes the guy who would know what hes talking about    He was also in the back of the store and didnt hear any of the interaction Mekanik guy comes in with the brake pads he purchased a short time ago   They are not at all usable anymore   He bought our top of the line ceramic brake pads   These pads were a fairly new product in our store at the time  and we didnt know how they actually performed   But they  were marketed as the best ceramic pads you could buy for every day  driving as well as a little high speed fun on the weekends   So to have  them go bad in a short amount of time was odd to be sure Mekanik    These pads are garbage   I bought them a few months ago and theyre already trashed   AND they ruined my rotors   So you guys need to give me new pads and pay for new rotors too  I explain that were sorry about the issue and wed be glad to help  in any way we can and blah blah blah     I take a look a the pads and  immediately notice the odd wear pattern  It looks like the pads were  installed upside down Me    Umm    Sir  these pads look like they were installed upside down    Mekanik    UPSIDE DOWN   No   I am a mechanic   I have been working on cars for loner than youve been alive     this goes on for a hot  minute but the conversation followed those lines   how dare you  who do  you think you are  threatens my job blah blah blah      Boss man hears  the commotion and steps in to try to calm things down Boss man    Hi sir  what seems to be the issue here  Mekanik    This punk seems to think he knows better than me and claimed I installed my brake pads upside down  Boss Man    Sir  the wear pattern on these pads show that they were installed upside down   With that being the case  unfortunately we cannot warranty the pads out   The warranty does not cover improper  installation  Mekanik    What kind of a store is this   Is this how you treat all of your customers      Blah blah blah    you know the drill Boss Man    Sir  if it would make you feel better  we do have an employee who was a master mechanic for   car company   and keeps his ASE   Automotive Service Excellence  certifications current   Would you like  him to take a look  Mekanik    Absolutely   Get someone up here with a brain      Boss Man    Hey  CW  Can you come up here for a second  CW    Yeah boss     walks up to the counter   Whats up  Boss Man    CW  do you notice anything odd about these brake pads  CW    Yeah  looks like they were installed upside down  Mekanik guy is fuming at this point   He finally leaves with no new  pads  and no new rotors   My coworkers and I had a pretty good laugh  about that as well as a conversation about how the hell he installed the  pads upside down   Some context   I did look like a punk   I was   years old  long shaggy hair  and was fresh out of mechanic school   I was in no way assuming I knew everything about cars   I just noticed the wear pattern and the notches worn out that indicated that the pads were installed upside down ASE certifications are needed to get a job at any reputable mechanic shop   Getting one is tough  and getting multiple takes specialized  training and studying   Master mechanic certifications are even tougher to get because you need specialized training from a specific company   car manufacturer  semi manufacturer  agricultural machines manufacturer  motorcycles manufacturer  etc       So CW absolutely knew what he was talking about  Anyone who has done a break job before  its really not that hard if you have the right tools and a little know how  knows its pretty difficult to put new pads on an old caliper the  right  way   The pads and caliper are literally curved with the curvature of the brake rotor  How this guy got them on upside down is beyond me,4783,914
903,ht188j,1,31,How should local retailer boycott credit card processing fees  CC processing fee has eaten a large part of profit  Its usually     of the total transaction amount  We are in a small town  only  grocery stores here  One store recently become cash only except EBT  but their customer base are mostly Hispanics who are used to carrying cash  while ours are mostly English speaking Americans who dont usually carry more than   of cash Debit PIN transaction is secure  fast and has a much lower fee of     so we would prefer being paid in debit PIN transaction than credit  How should we boycott CC processing fee  On the business side and legal side  what can we do  Retail companies cannot legally organize all  to stop accepting CC because that will be a  cartel  with antitrust violations   Can the retail workers union boycott CC  if the stores promise   of the saved CC processing fees will give them a salary boost,942,163

905,hshiy4,1,0,Customer complains about paper bag being placed on floor to be unhygienic for her clothes I am a till operative in the UK at a clothes goods store  Since lockdown has been lifted to an extent  our store has reopened with the typical health measures  glass panel per till  more space etc   This was my first shift back and probably  customers in  Every customer I have served I have placed the paper bag their items go in on the floor beside me for security purposes  also there isnt so much space on the counter now due to the panel   Ive been doing this method even before lockdown and we have all been told to do this anyway  Anyway my customer and her friends approach my counter and I start bagging their items up  bag on the floor facing upright  and her face drops and gets nasty and she bluntly says to me  Are you putting my clothes on the floor    I got annoyed and lifted the bag up  with her clothes inside  and said  No   And then she snaps at me and goes  youve been putting my clothes in a bag on the floor and now I want you to put them in a new bag and put this new bag on the counter right now   She then rambled on and said  what you just did is very unhygenic I cant believe you did that  First of all it doesnt make much difference where I put this bag  if I put the bag on the counter then technically its still unhygienic because people put their hands through the glass panel to give me money or to grab their bags  think of the lack of hygiene there      Secondly the only part of the bag that is unhygienic is the bottom and its hardly likely shell keep the bag once she goes home so whats the big deal  Also her clothes wouldnt have been affected Thirdly if hygiene is a big deal to her then maybe she shouldnt be out shopping in a busy store filled with people and limited social distancing Has anybody experienced strange things like this going back to work from lockdown,1927,359
906,hsdbxe,1,113,Maam  the store is on fire  I was working at a large chain store   This all conspired towards  the end of my shift  go figure    I was just taking some trash back to  the dumpster when a customer stopped me to inquire about a smoky smell   I  call my manager on a radio Me   Hey    boss    Ive got a customer telling me they smell smo    Fire alarm blares  That answered that   We  escort guests out of the store and make sure all staff is out  with  section leaders making sure all of their staff is out   What happened  next is    just plain stupid   Some Karen was flabbergasted that the  manager of the registers wouldnt go in and ring out her groceries Karen   Hi I have a cart full of groceries   Can I just check them out really fast  Manager   Maam  the store is on fire   Its against company policy  not to mention illegal  for me to return to the store   K   Ill give you my card and everything   Its not that much stuff    but its a cart full of groceries  M     I am not going in there to ring out some groceries   The building is  on fire   At best  I can have the fire department retrieve any personal  items  K   But I need those groceries  M   There is a   different store   the next block over   Im sure they have the groceries you need  K   But I already did my shopping here   There are frozen items  M   Im sorry  but I am not going in the store while    its on fire     This  went on much longer than it should have before Karen eventually huffed  off   My manager explained multiple times that THE STORE WAS ON FIRE   but she just couldnt grasp the concept of how dangerous and stupid it  was to demand we risk our lives for her groceries Mind  you  there was no mistaking that the store was definitely closed for  the evening because of the fire   Fire trucks were all around  cops   ambulances  ect     But there were still people driving by asking if we  were open For those wondering   our trash compactor caught fire   Turned out some teens thought that  lighting garbage on fire was funny   They were caught  arrested  and  charged with a felony   Fortunately  the fire was contained to the trash  compactor  no product was lost  the building was not damaged save for  the smell of smoke the next few days while it aired out  and most  importantly no one was injured,2337,444
907,hsar60,1,21,JUST READ Ironic TLDR  Lady doesnt want to read the sign  nor pay for her sh  tI dont know about you guys  but I cant stand these customers   the ones who stare at a sign  seemingly have some kind of brain cell between their ears and then turn to ask exactly what the sign answers Did you not just read it   This story takes place a few months ago  prior to this whole rona  during a popular holiday in my area  This holiday is very similar to Halloween with one exception  the customers love to print labels  I honestly dont know what they do with these labels  but they really   really   need them right that second and no one orders them in advance or actually has any clue what theyre doing  Which means a lot of repetitive explaining  pointing at signs  and frustrated and angry customers The thing is  my printing center doesnt actually have any label paper for them to print on other than this very simple return address label which you have to order through our website  Thats it  Theres no magic system in our computers that can magically set up these labels to print perfectly on whatever sheet our customers find lying around their house  So if you want us to set up your design for you  thats a fee  Also it takes like  hours  which they never have since they need it RIGHT NOW Also we only have two giant  industrial ready  LASER printers  If a customer brings in paper thats meant to go into an inkjet printer  a more high quality photo like printer  it will absolutely get demolished in that machine  It will and has broken our fuser in the machine  a   part   So no  I wont just  try it  when they demand that its worked before in the past  You could be lying  and I wont stake   on it and be stuck with a broken machine until new parts come in For all of these reasons  we had to post signs  MULTIPLE SIGNS  which basically read  gt   For any   Holiday   Label printing      gt    gt      If we set up your file  you will be charged a minimum    design fee  plus the price of printing  Here is how to set up your file with labels bought from  the retail part of the store     insert instructions       gt    gt      You paper MUST say  Laser safe   We will deny any order that is placed with label papers that does not have the original packaging      gt    gt      Turn times depend on how busy we are  You can pay an extra   to get your order faster  however the P amp M Associate will determine when that is based upon current order queue   Regardless of the sign  the customers still ask the same questions  So a woman comes in with a USB in her hand  After waiting in a lengthy line which Im doing my best to serve as fast as possible  shes a bit huffy when it gets to her turn Now Ive already told the customers ahead of her to look at the sign regarding our labels before placing their own order  So  hopefully  when she comes up she will do the same Nope Label Lady LL  Me ME LL   Jabs USB towards me  cuz f  ck me I guess   I have a picture on here I would like on x sticker paper ME    Okay  is your picture already set up to go on x label paper   lol I wont grab the USB stick until I know for sure shes going to place this order  I know from experience if I touch the damned thing  its assumed Ive accepted the job and wont charge for anything  LL   I want sticker paper  and no   you set it up for me  ME   while Im saying this  I also gesture to our sign thats printed in a large format and mounted right in front of her face    Label paper is what we print on  and we charge an additional    fee for any set up we need to do  Also  we do not have x label paper behind the counter  but you can—  LL         Thats absurd  You guys did it for me last time and set it up and everything  This is outrageous  Where does it say that   ME   literally points to it on the sign   You mean last   holiday    that was a year ago and the policies have changed recently  However  you can just go to this website here and—  LL   I never had to do anything like that  This is ridiculous  ME   Regardless  this is the policy now and I have no problem walking you through the steps on how to do it  You would just need to buy the paper from aisle— LL   and now Ive got to buy the paper too    she puts her hands on her hips and glares at me ME   Youve always had to buy the label paper    At this point Im just angry and probably not doing a good job at hiding it  ME   I interrupt her since I can tell shes just going to argue again with me   This sign will tell you how you need to set up your files  We are a print ready shop  as in you come in with your prints ready to go  If they are not already set up  we charge a fee for that  LL   I want a manager or someone who knows what theyre doing  They didnt charge me for this last year  I dont deserve to pay this  So I call a manager over and they dont know anything about the printing department so my manager turns to me and asks MANAGER   So  whats the policy this year  ME    states exactly what I told her  MANAGER   Okay    repeats exactly what I said to the customer   LL   furiously tries to stammer out that its ridiculous yadda yadda MANAGER   Okay  so know our policy  would you still like to place this order or not  LL   turns around and walks away,5363,984
908,hs75zd,1,216,Customers get trapped in the store because the closing announcements didn’t apply to them  I guess  I’m a cashier at a shop in the UK that sells clothing and home goods  For some reason we’ve had a bit of an uptick in    interesting     customers ever since we reopened post lockdown so if you guys want more stories I have a couple more to share  but this one is probably my favourite so far I tend to cover a lot of closing shifts  and a lot of the time I get to do the announcements to let customers know the store is closing  At       and   I say  roughly  “This is a customer announcement  The time in  shop  is  X  and we are closing in  Y  minutes  Can all remaining customers please make their way to the checkouts so that we can finalise your purchases before we close  Thank you ” and at  the announcement goes “The time in  shop  is  o’clock and we are now closed  Can any remaining customers please make their way to the checkout so we can finalise your purchases ” Basically  if you’re in the shop after   it’s pretty hard to miss the fact that we are in the process of closing up On the day this incident occured all the shopfloor colleagues got to leave right on the dot of  because they’d finished all their tasks for the night  so after we closed there were only three of us in the shop  me  my supervisor on checkouts  S   and my colleague  M  who was acting as the manager on shift  After I did the last closing announcement we waited a couple of minutes in case any more customers appeared  finished cashing up the tills  and then M locked the shop and went to the cash office while S and I went to the warehouse to do some jobs there  By this point we had been closed for about   minutes S and I have been in the warehouse for a couple of minutes sorting out returns when  suddenly  the warehouse door  which doesn’t lock so people can get in and out easily with heavy cages  flies open  And a customer  accompanied by her   year old son  pokes her head in I’m like “Um    hello ” because frankly my brain is refusing to process this situation a little bit  and the customer  honestly less stressed than I would be in this situation  goes “Can somebody let us out please  ”I call over to S  who’s further back in the warehouse  and she asks me to call M  who has the keys and can let them out  The only phone that the cashiers have access to is at the checkouts on the other side of the shop  and I don’t really want the customers to wander off again  so I go “Okay  if you just follow me over to the checkouts I’m going to call my manager on shift so that she can let you out ”And this customer’s face LIGHTS UP  And she goes “Oh  Are the tills still open ”Please bear in mind  it is  minutes after closing  This woman is actively trapped in the store  The shutters are down  There has been nobody on the shop floor  let alone at the checkouts  for several minutes  She had to go into an employees only area to get help  And now she thinks the checkouts are open and she can buy something At this point I feel no obligation to be polite and I’m honestly also just baffled so I go “No   There were actually several announcements letting you know the store was closing ”“Oh  I know ” she says  and at this point I feel such a boiling rage overtake me that all I can do without getting myself in trouble is shut up and walk over to the phone The story wraps up pretty quickly after that  I call M  whose verbatim response to “Hi  there’s some customers stuck in the store” is “Oh  for fuck’s sake ” M lets them out  but not without also locking herself out of the cash office because she didn’t bring those keys out with her in the rush to let these customers out  And I lie awake at night wondering how on earth I can make “We are closed  Either come and pay NOW or get out of the store” into a polite and professional closing announcement for future use,3916,735

917,hr98ss,1,23,Tales of disgruntled customers I work as a cartpusher for a retail establishment  one of many upsides of being a cart pusher is you don’t have to deal with disgruntled customers as much as people on the sales floor but not on this day  I’m pushing up a line of carts to the grocery side when I get to the garage door for the grocery entrance  I hear what sounded like incoherent screaming I turn around to see a man parked by the grocery pickup area    early s   mid s  pacing back and forth in front of a white Honda Civic   not sure year or model looked like a newer model  Him “yeah you   ” Me  visible confusion  Him “because of your dumbass one of the carts you left over there  the wind caught it and blew it and it hit my car  ” Me  visible confusion  as he’s standing bare minimum  feet away from me with no carts near his car  “right well   unfortunately sir there’s nothing I can do for you regarding this would you like to talk to a manager ”Him “no I don’t want to talk to a manager  Look at what you did to my car you f cking dumbass ” Me  gets radio out  “I need assistance out here I got a man accusing me of damaging his car  He is screaming at me  cussing at me  He’s very dissatisfied ” Less than a minute later the asset protection manager  support manager  and assistant manager come out  I quickly met them right outside of the garage door and quickly tell them that I have no idea what happened he just started loosing his mind accusing me of damaging his car  We all walk over to his vehicle and  the man has his finger pointed at an incredibly small dent in the front left side of his vehicle  If he didn’t have his finger there screaming “LOOK AT WHAT HE DID TO MY VEHICLE   ” I wouldn’t have even seen it  The guy starts going off yelling at the managers how I’m a dumbass and  this is all my fault that the wind supposedly blew a basket over  feet to hit his car  On a smooth flat surface with no hill incline and  no strong winds that day Him “Do you have any idea how hard I work to keep a spotless vehicle and his dumbass f cks everything up  ” At this point I couldn’t hold it back started letting some laughs out because  I didn’t lay a finger on this mans vehicle and I don’t control the wind  Assistant manager “stop laughing” I left to go to a cart carol to get more baskets because   I was thinking if I kept laughing this guy could attack me or something  I get back up about maybe a minuet or  later with more carts parked them right by the door and walked back over and the guy is still loosing his mind screaming at the managers  At this point the guys wife comes out of the store doesn’t even question what’s going on just walks right by it and sits in the passenger seat of the vehicle Him “Are you even going to pay for this  Look at my car ” Assistant manager “sir  if our associate did not damage your vehicle but  rather the wind picked up a basket as you told us then this is an act of nature we are not responsible for acts of nature ” Him “So the store even won’t pay for this  ” Assistant manager “sir you can file an incident report with us and we can do an investigation but there’s no guarantee that we will be held accountable for the damages ” Him “FORGET IT   ” Guy sits down in his vehicle and I turn to the managers  Me “I have no idea honestly where this guy is coming from I didn’t see a single basket near the c   ” Turn around to see him sitting in the drivers seat  one hand on the steering wheel the other hand flipping me off while repeatedly screaming “F ck you    ” Me  gives the guy the biggest smile I can while waving at him goodbye as he’s backing up  In the end I didn’t get in trouble for any of this and  there was no investigation launched regarding this issue,3793,719

921,hqt8sn,1,0,Playing it unsafe When I worked for a thrift store  I had this interesting  yet frustrating story   As a thrift store  we got all kinds of random stuff  including sporting equipment   We would occasionally get rollerblades from time to time among the sporting goods   This is important I was doing my thing by putting away newly arrived merch and go backs when I saw a kid that looked no older than  or  messing around the store   I didnt think much of it as people would bring their kids while thrifting   A moment later  I saw the same kid crawling around the store with his hands in a pair of rollerblades  gliding down the aisles and I have no idea where his parent or guardian is   I tell him politely that he cant do that because its not safe   He smiles me and ceases doing this activity for what seemed like five minutes  And then hes at it again I ask him kindly  again  to stop scooting on the floor with the rollerblades and he smiles at me and ceases doing it momentarily and then starts it up again   I tell him AGAIN to stop doing this  He stops and starts again  rinse and repeat   I am sick of this and quite concerned that he could seriously hurt himself so I pull my supervisor aside and tell her that I have been watching this little imp scoot around the store with rollerblades on his hands for the past   minutes and ignoring me  She nods in acknowledgement and leaves to do something else   At this point  I didnt know if he was trying to be defiant and do what he wants  my logic was that he ignored me because I wasnt his parent or guardian  About  minutes or so passes and I go to ring a Hispanic woman at the register and I ask her if she had any discounts for seniors  military  etc   She looks at me funny and tells me something along the lines of  no English    Standing with her was her son and it turns out that he was the Wild Child that was scooting around the store with rollerblades   Turns out that the kid ignored me because he didnt understand English  From what I observed  this woman did NOTHING to corral her kid or tell him to knock it off  She was off hanging out with her friends and perusing through clothing   Parents need to parent,2202,422

923,hqp0q4,1,10,You Have Fun With That  This incident happened a couple years ago so Im going off what I can remember There was this kid  no more than  years old  who would come in occasionally during the night and graveyard shifts  More times than not the kid was high out of his mind and would just say the dumbest things that made no sense  He also tried to act like he was tough s    t all the time but to me he was just an idiot  Some backstory  The city my store is located at is notorious for its crime  Weve been ranked in magazines as the worst city to live in in America  So I am fairly used to encountering people on drugs  theft  and violent people at this store  One night I was working in our stores photo department  entering in something on the computer  when the kid comes up to my counter  Ive already had it with this kid on past occasions  so I was less than polite with him as the following conversation ensued  Kid  You gonna give me a hug Me  Nope Kid  Aww why not Me  I dont know you like that and youre not worth it Kid  Thats cold By this point I was done with the conversation and went back to the computer  This blocked my view of the kid to where I could only see his shoulders and head  He said something else to me  but I wasnt paying attention to him anymore Me  Well you have fun with that Kid  What Me  I said  you have fun with that Kid  Damn  you tough He then lifts up his shirt  but since I was behind the computer I could only see the hem of his shirt was by his shoulders  I just thought he was being weird from the drugs again  He then walks away  My coworker  lets call him Steve  walks up to me a few minutes later Steve  Hey  did you see that guy Me  Yeah  proceeds to tell him about my encounter with the kid Steve  Dude  he had a gun Me  WHAT Steve  Yeah  he was telling me that he was high on thizz and he showed me his gun under his shirt Me  Why didnt you call the police  Or tell someone immediately  Steve  I wasnt gonna snitch on him   I think thats what I remember him saying at least So I was very lucky nothing worse happened that night  Im assuming that the part where he was talking and I was not paying attention was him talking about his gun  to which I responded with  Have fun with that   My lack of fear must have made him lift up his shirt to show off said gun  and since I could not see anything I did not give the reaction that he wanted  Who knows  but I never saw that kid again after that,2501,470

926,hpyrqh,1,31,Marilyn Manson Gets Mad About Cigarettes First post here so hopefully I’m doing this right  Shouldn’t be too hard  right  Ok so here’s the story I work at a convenience store in south Texas  It’s like a mom and pop type shop  so it’s a single store  not part of a franchise or whatever  I’ve been working as a cashier here for almost a year  it’ll be a year in August  This happened about half a year ago or so  Honestly I can’t remember exactly when  I wasn’t the cashier involved but it happened when I was working  Anyway   I come back from break  or out of the bathroom or something  and I see one of our regular customers yelling about something  He’s a tall guy in his late ’s early ’s and goth  Think  Marylin Manson lite  He dresses in the same style  I’ve seen him in the store many times and rung him up a few times as well  but never really spoke to him  This particular day he’s yelling loudly about some cigarettes  He said they expired and he wanted a refund  At our store we are not allowed to do exchanges or refunds for tobacco products  The only exception is if they come back within like maybe ten or less minutes after buying it  and it’s unopened  And even then we don’t really do anything like that  So I guess it depends on the case  but I digress  So my boss tries to see the date at the bottom and can’t see what it says  it’s scratched off  Then he asks the guy if he has his receipt  He says no  So my boss is saying there’s nothing he can do  but he’s willing to give the guy another pack of the same cigarettes  for free  or maybe a lower price     Wouldn’t be a refund or an exchange  Sounds like a deal right  Not according to this guy  He started yelling about calling the cops on us and getting us shut down  My boss was done at that point and told the guy to go ahead and do it  but whatever he did  he’d have to leave the store before he did so  Then the guy said this “I’m going to call the—the—the  searches for word  ASPCA on you guys and you shut down ”I was laughing so hard after he left  He never did call anyone and he hasn’t been back since,2098,407
927,hpvn9d,1,18,No Haggling Here The pharmacy retail store I used to work at also had a photo department where I worked at a lot of the time  By the time I was hired they had stopped processing film in store  so we were basically just a glorified print shop  There were a couple touch screen monitors for customers to use so that they could upload photos and create an order for us to print  About half of the customers I dealt with had no idea how to use this machine  so I would walk it through with them until they understood  One day I was helping a woman at the monitor  English was definitely not her first language  so I was making sure to ask multiple times if what we were choosing to order was what she wanted  She said yes  even after I would point at the print size and amount of each print she had told me to order  I placed the order and started to print it Her order had a few x and x pictures  and x photos were around    each if I remember correctly  Most people did not pay attention to the pricing until checkout  but when I help people at the monitors I make sure they look at the total amount they have to pay before placing an order  That way they stay happy and we dont waste materials printing out photos people dont want to pay for  This lady still wanted all of her photos even though she was going to be paying quite a bit for her xs  In the case there is a mistake made when printing  or if someone does not want a certain photo  we do not simply throw it away  There is a special box we place the photos in that get sent to be shredded in order to protect the privacy of customers  So after I print out the ladys photos I bring them up to the counter and let her inspect them before paying   L   lady  Me   me L  I did not want these  pointing at x photos Me  You dont want any of them  I had made sure when ordering them that this is what you wanted L  No  I dont want  Only these  pointing at x photos Me  Okay Im a little frustrated at this point because I spent a lot of time making sure we understood each other  I just blame the language barrier and start to adjust her order so she is not charged for the xs  Then I take the x pictures and put them in the shredder box L  What happens to pictures if I dont buy Me  They get thrown away to be shredded L  I pay    then Me  So  you DO want the pictures L  Yes  but I pay    since they getting thrown away Me  No maam   we do not haggle prices here  If you want them you need to pay full price Lady ends up not buying the x photos  I couldnt help but think that the ladys plan the entire time was to try and get those photos for a significantly cheaper price,2704,518
928,hprxdh,1,144,How dare you give me the correct change  This happened   years ago  It was the weekend so the store was filled with people  My next customer was a middle aged woman with a short blonde hair cut  eyelash extensions that needed refilling  etc  She paid with cash and when I was about to give her change  she decided she didnt want one of the items anymore  So I refunded her the item  I gave her the change from the first transaction  original purchase  plus the amount for the item she returned  She looked at the money I gave her and said it wasnt right  I explained the whole process   you gave me this much   then you returned this item  the value of that item was this much   so this is what you get back   At this point she was adamant I was wrong and she was right  She did the whole dramatic sigh and eye roll thing and began talking very loudly  so other customers could hear   that I had given her the wrong change  I told her again that the amount I have given her was correct  One of my managers was nearby and told the customer that we can count all the money in the register to make sure the correct change was given  Side note  I have social anxiety  so being talked down to  in front of a whole line of customers   and then having her stand there and watch while I counted all the money in the register was horrible  I was shaking the entire time   As soon as my manager told her I had given her the correct change  the customer stopped looking at me and acted like I didnt exist  She directed her conversation only to my manager and made up excuses that she must have gotten mixed up  She then left the store  completely ignoring me  I guess an apology was too much to expect,1712,326

930,hplbvs,1,24,I Cant Understand You I used to work at a major pharmacy retail store until last year  I have many stories working at that place  so Ill probably be posting more soon The story starts off with a regular customer shopping in our store  He was always very serious looking and never responded when I greeted him at the cash register  like many do   so I just assumed that is the type of person he is and didnt think any more of it  We have weekly and monthly deals for tons of items in the store that we mark with tags  It specifically says on the tags that you can get the sale price if you have a rewards account with us  Many people do not read this  but it gets quickly solved when we explain at the register So one day I am ringing up the regular customer for some dish soap that is on sale  Before I can ask if he has a rewards account with us  to get the sale price   he starts to what I can only describe as yelling at me  but without saying a word   He is literally trying to noiselessly yell at me about something  pointing at the screen and using body language that gives the impression that he is very angry  I am utterly confused as to what is going on seeing as that he has never done this before  I apologize to him and explain that I do not understand what he is trying to say  His response is to keep repeating what he has already been doing  He stares right at me as he silently speaks  and since I am a terrible lip reader  I apologize to him again  It then clicks that perhaps the man is deaf or mute  since he was always so quiet in the past   so I quickly grab a pen and paper near me and ask him to write down what hes trying to say  He ignores this and continues to silently yell  I try to get him to write several more times before asking my coworker at the next register if she can read lips  She is also at a loss  and we now have a large line at our registers because of this guy  I finally tell him that I cannot understand him if he is not going to write anything down for me  as I cannot read lips  Then all of a sudden he blurts out about the price of the dish soap  I am now extremely pissed off because we just wasted a good  minutes trying to figure out what this guy is saying  when he could speak the entire time   I then have to explain that he needs a rewards account to get the sale price  as he should already know being a regular customer   and ask if he would like me to enter that in now  He refuses and buys the soap at regular price,2492,495

932,hpa6rd,1,146,I dont know how to email  cant you just do it for me   Our store allows customers to email their print jobs to a server which will then send back a code straight to their inbox and allow them to input it on the machine for quick and easy printing  All of this is fairly obvious  we have signs posted everywhere not to mention we tell everyone how to do it when they ask us  This is a SELF SERVICE option  any order placed with me  a full service employee  is done online or in person and it’s obvious you are expected to pay more for that service  We explain this to every customer Not only that but once you get to the machines it is printed clear as day on how to follow the steps  what the email is  and how to input the code once you get it  The steps are simple  Press your option  print   put your card in  select how you are printing  by USB or Email   put in your USB or your code  then print However  if you’ve ever worked retail  you know just as much as I how people DON’T READ Regardless  for the sake of customer service I swallow all these thoughts down and try my best to help A Woman comes in and tells me she needs to print from her email  I tell her how and she is almost immediately angry   W     “I don’t know how to use email  can you show me how ”   Me     “I actually don’t know your email or the service you use  you would have to find your documents and then I could—  W   “Why can’t you just print it ”   Me     “Well  you need to email it over to this first so we can access it and I’ll show you how to print it over on our self serve printers ”   W     “You have printers back there  just print it”   moves phone closer to me   Me     steps back slightly   “Unfortunately I can’t touch your phone due to   the rona   and this is our full serve area  If I were to print your documents there is a mandatory       upcharge to have them printed on the spot  You can come back at   time   to pick up your order if you’d want to waive that fee ”   W     “It’s one page  you can’t just print it  I need this now  I can’t wait”   Me     Trying to hide my frustration since this is the third time I’m having this conversation and I’ve got    jobs that need to be finished  Her    job doesn’t matter much to me    “No  I can’t ”   W     “Fine  how do I do it again ”   Me     tells her   W     “I can’t get it  something’s wrong ”   Me     looks to see that she is getting an error that she’s not signed into her email    “You just need to enter your passwo—”   W     “I DON’T KNOW MY PASSWORD” Me   stammers   “I don’t know your password either ”   W     “What good is that   My phone service just changed and my husband needs these documents printed so now I don’t have access to the right email but I NEED THESE DOCUMENTS” Me  “ Well you can just hit “reset password” and follow the—”   W     “No because it’s gonna try to text me the code and I don’t have the same phone service WHY DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND IT’S SO SIMPLE”   Me     trying not to hit this woman   “Ma’am  we are not your phone company  neither are we your email service  You are using our self serve area  I’ve done everything I can for you but this is something you will need—”   she goes to interrupt me but I raise my voice so she can’t   “—to solve  If you can’t access your documents  there is nothing I can do  I can’t print what’s not in front of me  I can’t pull it out of thin air ”   W     “Your job is to help me ” Me   “And your job is to have your documents ready to print  Now I have other customers I need to help  when you get your document ready I’ll be glad to help you ” At this point I just ignored her while she sat there and shouted every so often “ It’s still not working ” There was nothing I could do  every avenue I tried to go down to help her she blocked off  Besides  I had a line of six or seven behind her  I’m only one person and I can’t sit there for a half hour and play IT  That’s simply not my job She ended up calling the manager over who spent nearly two hours with her  only to find out those documents weren’t even in her email  She threw a fit  but I was so busy I didn’t get to hear it,4179,770
933,hp3tla,1,18,Tale from the Copy Shop  I’ve worked for retail for the past seven years and I’m glad to say I’m finally out  Which gives me the perfect opportunity to share some stories while working here  The good news is that I have a great relationship with my managers  so they are a bit more lenient on what I’m aloud to say  Seven years hardens you and makes your temper all the much shorter  To start this off  I live in an area where there is a lot of families – as in everyone drives minivans or used Toyota Camry’s  Most are dented and worn down since the area isn’t very rich  and practically no one owns the vehicle they’re driving  A father comes in with his kids in tow and briskly walks to the back of the store – our furniture section  He has five kids  ranging from oldest being around  or   to the youngest toddling behind no more than two years old  I’m working the copy area  however from my perch I can see straight back and I watch with horror as his five kids break off and begin running around the store  They start pulling product off the shelves and whack each other with it  expensive equipment too but they don’t seem to care  I don’t like this obviously  since everything they’re throwing around is going to have to be damaged out  considered too damaged to sell  or put back on the shelves neatly since it’s all laying on the floor  My supervisor doesn’t like this even more and I can see his face turning red The entire time the child tornado is making its rounds up and down the aisles  the father is intensely studying the chairs and holding up my other associate who is glancing back at me wondering what to do about the children  My supervisor finally has had enough when one of them tries to climb up the employee ladder  which is chained and situated against a far wall for the express purpose of NOT being climbed on  SUP   interrupting the conversation between my associate and the father  “Excuse me sir  could you please watch your children  They can’t be grabbing and throwing product off the shelf – thank you ”FATHER   “I’m trying to buy a chair  what do you expect me to do ” SUP  “ I don’t know  watch your kids maybe ” FATHER   looks to me   “I don’t understand  what do you expect me to do  I’m trying to buy this chair ” ME   “Watch your kids  they are wrecking our store ” FATHER   shushes his kids which gets them to settle down for all of  minutes My supervisor and I hear a crash and the toddler starts crying  Thankfully no one was hurt and they had just knocked down a heavy product which hit the ground and scared the youngest one  This sets off my supervisorSUP   “Sir I need you to watch your children  or you can leave ” FATHER   softly  “ What do you expect me to do” At this point we just kinda stare at him  since we just TOLD him what he needs to do SUP   “I’m not the one who chose to have that many kids ” This gets him to decide he wants the chair he’s been staring at and the other associate helps him get situated  I man the copy center as it got suddenly busy but my supervisor runs to help clean up and follows the group to make sure they don’t make any more mess on their way out  After they leave  I hear over this the radio SUP  “ Someone get his plate number ” MANAGER   “Why  what’s going on ” SUP   “He can’t fit the chair in the trunk of his Camry  so he put down the seats  made the kids get in the trunk and put the chair on the folded seats ” What the hell is wrong with people  Unfortunately  he was gone before the cops arrived   I never saw him again  so I wonder if someone along the line got him to stop,3623,663
934,hp15n1,1,5,Two injuries for the price of one This all happened today while I was at work  The people involved are ok  as far as I know  Fall   To give y’all an idea where this happened in the store I was at the raw meat section and the person who fell was by the cheese and breakfast sausage  I was doing my job filling orders when I heard a commotion coming from there  So as a good employee I walk fast over to see what is happening  When I got close one of the people yelled that someone needs to call   Freaked out at this point I sprinted over and saw an elderly woman on the floor bleeding from the head  Thankful she was fully alert and moving around and talking   Note  I didn’t learn this till later by another coworker that a  year old boy pushed into her knocking her over  It was an accident and the child was remorseful  The coworker that called  said “They are on their way  Op you should go find a manager ” So I did  I straight up ran to the managers office and saw one coming out and told them “To just follow me a customer is hurt ” She followed shortly after a pharmacy tech with a pair of the medical examiner glove on  The big boss of the grocery store I work at came in while the technician was talking to the customer and told me and my coworkers to go back to work and their handle thing from there  Last I heard about it the woman needed stitches and went to the hospital  Story   I was putting up my trolley after my shift and saw some elderly woman on the ground outside the store  I asked them if everything was ok and was told she just fell over  I looked under the woman’s head and noticed some blood and told them  So I went and got some paper towels and the same tech from earlier was already there  She told me to get big boss and I try and find him  Got no luck  The woman’s husband just drove her home because she didn’t want to call   Tl dr  two people got hurt and only one went to the hospital,1939,382
935,hov42y,1,9,You’ve got my computer  A couple of years ago I worked at an electronics store and  one evening  found myself cleaning the products after we’d closed  In our big  open store I had the whole floor to clean by myself after most of my colleagues had gone home  BANG   BANG BANG BANG  I looked up to see a smartly dressed middle aged gentleman rattling the locked front door  frantically trying enter the shop “LET ME IN ” he bellows ferociously “Hi  Sorry  but we closed about  minutes ago  We’re open as normal tomorrow ” I say as I look up from cleaning  This was a common mistake of passers by so I didn’t think much of it “YOU’VE GOT MY COMPUTER ”“Sorry ”“IN THE BACK  MY COMPUTER IS IN THE BACK   GO AND GET IT ”“Sorry but we’ve been closed since half  and everyone from the repair team has gone home  We’re open first thing tomorrow so if you come back then  we can help and sign it out for you ” I calmly explain through the door “Listen  I know you’ve got it  so just go in the back  get it for me and open this door ” he menacingly mumbles at a volume still audible through the door “I don’t know what else I can say  I’m really sorry but we are closed  We can’t operate when the shop is closed and staff are not here ” I reply  beginning to lose patience  I feared that I was going to have to explain to this person the very definition of the word ‘closed’ “I travelled half an hour to get here  and you’re telling ME that you’re not going to give me MY laptop which I KNOW you have  Is that what you’re saying ” the confused  angry man continues  This went on for a good few minutes  and it struck me that this man was actually not going to ask for my manager  Perhaps he suspected that his best shot of reaping the benefits of his epic  minute trek was to bully a shop floor employee into submission  I had no other option  I had to do an FRK  Full Reverse Karen   I told him that I was going to speak to the manager  As I walked the length of the store into the back  I could hear the gentleman exclaiming his fury to the world in hope that his needs would be miraculously fulfilled by the universe if he poured enough anger and bad language into his immediate surroundings  the outside of our electronics store My manager walked up to the gentleman at the door  patiently listened to his concerns  simply explained once that when the store is closed we cannot conduct business and told him that his only option was to return at a time when we are open  My account of events and the rage on the gentleman’s face were enough for my manager to see that his only option was to deliver the news and remove himself from the situation  As I resumed the cleaning of my devices  I could hear the gentleman bellowing with the might of Zeus about the ridiculousness of such a farce and that he would be having some serious words with head office the next day Finally  he retreated    as his terrified   year old daughter sheepishly followed him away into the night,3008,551
936,hotepi,1,0,Snow Tubing Hill Stories I work at an indoor snow tubing hill in a very popular tourist area  The entire area is extremely busy right now  us included  so I thought I would share a few stories of idiocy from my time here First  background  we have  positions in here  Ticket booth  gift shop  and the  spots on the hill  Bottom and Top Carpet  who work the conveyor belt that takes you up  helping people on off and checking time  Air  who makes sure everyone is seated in their tube correctly and pushes the button that sends you  and Bottom Hill  who helps people ferry dropped items off the hill and keeps people behind the fence and line of bags that separates the bottom hill area from the rest of the place so that people dont get hit  Bottom Hill is also supposed to give Air a thumbs up when theyre ready to go  but Air almost never pays attention to it and will send people regardless  even if theres someone visibly in the area The positions will be called by their abbreviations from here out  BC  TC  Air  and BH Im mostly working either BH or TC  Or first story comes from a day I was working BH Nowadays  i have developed the habit of standing near to the entrance to the BH area  so I can more easily catch people entering the area  However  I didnt do that yet at the time that our first story takes place  I do this because people are in this area when theyre not supposed to be a lot  People wander into there trying yi find where to go  kids go running into there when they get loose from their parents  and a lot of people stand up from their tubes  walk to the back of the area  and get set up to take pictures videos off their friends and family coming down This lady  however  came walking into the area  to directly in front of the exit to a lane  and got set up to take pictures of her son coming down I  of course  see this and go walking over to her and tell her that she cant be in this area  she has to stay behind the fence  She says that shes just trying to get pictures of her son  to which I say that thats fine  as long as shes behind the fence  because this area is dangerous  I have been hit standing at the back by the bags  She was right in front of the exit to a lane  She refused to move I told her that theyre not coming down until she leaves  which convinces her and she starts to put her phone away when she realizes that there person who was working Air that day has  indeed  pushed the button and they are currently on the way down  She gets set back up again and starts taking pictures  completely ignoring my protests that she has to leave the area I know that it could be my job if she gets hit  so I just walked to in front of her to block that from happening  Thankfully  the kid was small and didnt even reach me  but Id he was even  pounds  he probably woulda plowed clean through us both For the second and third stories  I was working TC  Theyre both pretty short  so Ill try to keep them brief Part of TCs job is making sure people stay on the conveyor belt once theyre on it until they reach the top  controlling the flow of movement through the top area  there are  rings that we can block off or open up depending on how busy we are   and ensuring nobody walks on the conveyor belt  A group of people came in  about  adults and  little kids  The kids looked to be around  or   and twins The twins were constantly stepping off to the side  walking down  jumping back on  and walking up  Wouldnt listen to me telling them not to at all  And not only did the adults from the group not tell them to stop  they started walking up it to  We were busy enough that I had it open to the second ring  and these people would just jump over the chain into the first  cutting in line and completely ignoring me telling them not to do that either After a little while  the manager had some business with the snow machine  which is out a back door from the top area  While he was up there  he saw them doing this and asked me what was going on  To which I said that Ive told them not to at least  times by then and they refused to listen  So he tries taking to them and they dont listen to him either at all  It was the first time Ive ever seen him get frustrated  But not even he has the authority to kick someone out unless theyre trying to stay a fistfight or something  so they got away with it all night The last story comes from last night  Similar to the previous  kid keeps walking on the conveyor belt and I have to tell him to stop a few times  But opposite to the last story  the kids mom actually controls him  telling him that if someone had to talk to him again  hes done  I told her that I really wished more parents would say that to their kids  She was extremely nice and the rest of the night with them went great,4836,928

940,hoo911,1,7,You break it  you buy it  A long time ago  I worked for a tiny  family owned candy store   One day I was working alone with the owner   He left for a bit for his lunch break  and  women came in with  small kids between them   They told the kids they could each pick out a lollipop   The moms continue to browse  and I saw  of the kids drop their lollipops on the floor   When they were done  one woman came up to the counter to pay   She said  “they broke these two   Can they just pick out two different ones  instead ”I was so caught off guard   If I broke something in a small store like that  I would pay for it   “You break it  you buy it ” right  Especially since these were just lollipops    it wasn’t going to break the bank or anything   After a moment of trying to figure out what to say to this woman  I blurted out  “if you did that  then some other kid that comes in here is going to get these broken ones ”I saw her face slowly turn from happy to steaming angry   She snatched the lollipops out of the hands of all the other kids and slammed them on the counter   She said  “come on  we’re leaving and NEVER coming back again ”  The other women looked bewildered and asked what was wrong  they hadn’t been paying attention to our conversation    She just reiterated “we’re leaving ” And they all left   I did feel bad after that  but I was sure I’d done the right thing   When the owner came back from lunch  I told him what happened   I knew he would tell me I’d done well and it would all be forgotten  but it was just the opposite   He said  “if you’re in a grocery store and you knock a jar off a shelf and it breaks  they don’t make you pay for it ”  To this day  I think back and don’t know what I should have done   If I took my kids in a small store and the broke something  I would absolutely pay for it  no question   It’s not the same as a large grocery store  but even there if my kids broke something I would feel responsible   But when you’re trying to make the customer happy  the cost of a couple of lollipops isn’t a big deal  I suppose What would you have done,2106,427

944,ho2lvg,1,77,Not the place to skateboard  This was about  years ago when I was the manager of a video game store  We were right next door to a place that sold haircare products in a box mall setup We would have an issue with the local school kids skateboarding on the sidewalk in front of our store  Even though  they was a skate park about  blocks away  A few times  a kid would not be paying attention and would run into an elderly lady leaving the neighbor store  The worst one  the poor lady was knocked over and broke her wrist  and had bruising on the side of her face  Her head hit the ground pretty hard The neighbour store manager and I talked and we agreed to ask kids to stop skateboarding the second we saw it  We would also let them know about the skate park    understood  and would go to the park  But this is a story of the   I was putting out stock on a quiet morning when I saw a kid go whizzing by on his skateboard  I stopped and watched for a minute to see if he was passing by  or not  Sure enough he is going back and forth  I popped out the front door and advised him about the skatepark and we dont allow skateboarding on the sidewalk due to accidents  He shrugs me off and walks away   min later  he was back with his friends  I advised them again  they shrugged me off  I got a call from the neighbour store manager  she said she told them the same thing  but they told her to  Fuck off  I then went to the front door as one of my regulars was coming in  I told the regular I would be a monet  he didnt care  I stopped one of the kids again and told him he cant skateboard here  same spiel as always   Due to some accidents  we dont allow skateboarding here  you are going to have to leave  There is a skate park  blocks north    Kid shrugs at me and walks back to his buddies I go back to my front counter because the regular was ready to buy his game  We finish the transaction and he walks to the front door  I see him stop at the door and pause for a minute  My immediate thought was he was watching for the kids and didnt want to get hit  He then whips the door open  but doesnt go through  and I hear this loud bang  He turns to me and says  Hey Rob  youre right  Accidents do happen when you skateboard in front of your store    and then proceeds to walk out  I grabbed some paper towel and walked to the door The kid was laying on the ground crying  and nose bleeding all over his shirt  I handed him a peice of paper towel and said   You guys should go to the skate park   I then wiped the grease stain left on my door and went back to work  Never saw those kids again,2620,514

950,hnrff1,1,22,I dont think youre a customer here    I work at a dry cleaner which is owned by my family  I have a lot of nice customers but theres a few because theyre wealthy  they like to treat me as if Im garbage or since I dont have as much money  they think Im not worthy to be talked to respectfully    To begin the story  a woman walks in dropping off her bosses clothes  She was on the phone and pretty disrespectful to begin with   Me   Hi whats your last name    I E  So I know whos clothes I have   Her  The last name is  M   Me   Im sorry  I cant find it  is your boss a new customer    Her  almost yelling   No  hes been going here for years   Me   Are you sure    Her  still yelling   YEAH  Im sure   Me  trying to avoid making her madder   My mistake  Ill just take them   She storms out   A week or two later  she comes back and her demeanor completely changes saying her bosses dry cleaner was someplace else and she dropped the clothes off at the incorrect place  my dry cleaners   She never apologized about her behavior which doesnt surprise me  This happened a couple of months ago but even today someone rudely accused me of  losing their clothes  when in reality it was under their husbands name  As soon as I mentioned this fact  their tone suddenly changed and obviously no apology Its tiring to be a party to this rudeness  In certain situations  such as the woman I dealt with today  I can somewhat understand why someone would be upset but its a bit tiring to be spoken to as if Im an enemy  Im merely trying to help people,1572,298

953,hnmn7u,1,8,Wrong entrance This happened about  minutes before writing this  I was on my unpaid  minute break  eating and chatting in the break room  when I heard the doorbell ring  This door bell was for an employee only entrance  so I figured I would let them in  As I came out of the break room and turn the corner to the door  I saw that they looked like a customer  I figured they might be with a third party selling things in our store  set mywent to go ask what they were doing  As soon as I open the door  they asked  “ is this the entrance to the pharmacy ”As I said just a bit ago  the door she went up to was the employee only door  It’s how employees get in and out of the building when the store is closed  and it leads directly into an employee only area  I kindly told them that it was an employee only entrance  and luckily they understood and I gave them directions to the pharmacy that was inside the store,919,180
954,hnmdan,1,41,No Public Restrooms So about  years ago I worked at a candle store located in an outdoor shopping center  It was a slow day so my manager just had me straightening stuff on the shelves  This customer walks in and I go to greet her   M  me  C customer  SM store manager M  “Hello  can I help you find anything today ”C  “No but do you guys have a restroom ” M  “Unfortunately we don’t  but  insert store name across the street  has public restrooms you can use ”I went back to straightening shelves while the lady was looking around at candles  A couple minutes later I see her go up to the register where my manager was but didn’t have any items in her hand  Our store is pretty small so I could hear their conversation SM  “Hi  can I help you with anything ”C  “Hi  do you guys have a restroom ” SM  “Technically yes  but it’s for employee only  We don’t have restrooms open to the public ” C  “Oh  okay ”I then hear my manager say  “Uh ma’am  what are you doing ” At this point I look over because I’m wondering what’s happening  I see the customer is behind our counter right in front of the door to our back room C “You just said you guys had a restroom ”SM  “No  I’m sorry it’s just for employees only ” C  “Well I’m the only one in here can’t I use it real quick ” SM  “No  I’m sorry  It’s against policy to let non employees in the back room  I could get in trouble for that ”She then tells her there’s one across the street and after a few minutes the lady leaves  It just baffles me how people don’t listen and still try to do something even after being told no,1592,290
955,hnl6aa,1,68,A Customer Handed Me Drugs So this was when I  F  was new to my job at a popular convenience store in the north east  and I was on register  This was in  like  August of last year So a guy comes up and asks for a carton of cigarettes  No big deal  people ask all the time  and it was a popular brand  I took the carton out and told him his total  which was like  something dollars   and he proceeded to hand me a   bill that was folded I open the register up and unfold the bill to find what looks like a tiny bag of either cocaine or heroin  I didn’t know what to do so I kinda just slid it back on the counter for him to grab  The moment he realized I had the bag  it was like he got hit with a huge wave of anxiety  as he quickly took back the bag and started shaking  trying to complete the transaction as quickly as possible Coming from someone with really bad anxiety  I could tell he was thinking “is this teenage girl gonna call the cops on me” so the only thing I could say was “don’t worry  I don’t judge ”He got his change and BOLTED out the door  and I immediately washed my hands and wiped down the counter   everything I touched I told my mom  who works at the same store as me and was in deli at the time  the situation and she bursted out laughing  She said that even if they did call the cops  they wouldn’t have gotten to him in time,1369,272

967,hkqusn,1,9,A surprise customer About  years ago I was working at a little kiosk in a mall in Montana that sold custom T shirts   Most of our customers were tourists that wanted a shirt with “Montana” on it somewhere   One night  it was VERY slow   There was hardly anyone in the mall   Just before closing  there was a group of about  or  people that came walking past  when one girl stopped and told the group to hold up  she wanted to look at something   She asked me for a shirt with “Montana” on it   I showed her some of our most popular designs  and told her we could print the word “Montana” on any of them   She said she wanted something in a smaller size   I held up an adult small  and she said smaller   I thought  “ok  maybe she wants this for a kid she knows ”  I show her the kids’ shirts  and she picks up a pretty small one   She holds it up to her chest  pulls it tight  and asks her friend if she thinks it will fit   I tried to keep my chin from hitting the floor  I mean  this was a size for maybe a  year old   The friend was leaning on the counter looking extremely bored   I also noticed how remarkably short this friend was   She says  “whatever  just hurry up ”  I’m thinking  there’s no way she’s going to fit in this tiny shirt  but whatever   So then I have to help find her a print that will fit on a shirt that small that doesn’t look like it was designed for a toddler to wear   I showed her what I could find  but she didn’t like any of it   It was all too babyish  because  well  they were meant for young child   To make it worse  the friend was huffing and sighing and being so impatient and kept telling her  “LET’S JUST GOOOO ”  She finally gave up and they both left  along with the other guys who had been standing back not saying a word the whole time   As I started putting away all the shirts and prints I had pulled for her  I thought about how odd the whole episode was After they walked away  I saw a large group of people start running after them   One grabbed a pen and scratch paper off my counter as he ran by   As I watched this odd spectacle  all I could think was that maybe this was some important person they wanted autographs from   Then it hit me    there was a Christina Aguilera concert in town that weekend   Now I recognized her    the short  impatient “friend” at the counter    was her,2346,474

969,hknkqf,1,9,Irritated customer claims he can buy the store When I worked for a retail store a long time ago  I got to assist this customer   He needed to make two separate purchases of items and wanted to pay with checks   Fine  we accept checks   I go to make sure all the details were in order but on both checks  something felt off   Maybe its my unfamiliarity with check numbering but something felt weird I noticed that the check number on the top didnt match the bottom completely   It was one digit off   I let him know and Irritated Customer  IC  said that they came from his bank  etc   So I call for my supervisor and let her know what was going on and that I didnt process the checks because of the check numbers   Supervisor then asked him if his bank normally does this and IC  becoming well  irritated at this point  said that everythings legit   We ask him for his ID and he produces it   Supervisor then processes the two transactions separately During the first transaction  Supervisor let IC know that if his check bounces  he could be charged a fee   IC then argues with my supervisor that he has plenty of money in his bank account and isnt worried   Supervisor then has to repeat herself  saying that he needs to verify it on the pin pad and IC gets more irritated  saying that he has enough money and that he has enough to buy the whole store   Supervisor turns to me and rolls her eyes and finally convinces him to verify on the pin pad   IC still kept repeating to us how he had more money than the store and that he could buy the store if he wanted after we rang him up for his second purchase,1616,312
970,hkm9bp,1,49,The time a customer made me cry on my birthday I dont give permission for this to be shared or used by anyone else On my phone so please forgive formatting and mistakes BACKGROUND When I was at university I worked a few summer jobs over the years until I got an engineering internship which led to a part time job One of these summer jobs was a manager for a cafe inside a large British homeware shop starting with a D and at the beginning I thought it would be great as I was told it was shift work so I would only have to work  hours a day or so for  days a week However it turned out that the cafe was the most understaffed department with only  of us so we would have to work  hours a day and no one wanted to transfer to the team as it was known for being stressful  But hey more money right On to the story  As the cafe was small and the kitchen smaller  we could only cook a small number of paninis and toasties which led to queues and backlogs in the summer weekends On one of these weekends it was so bloody hot me and staff kept ducking into the kitchen to stand next to the fridge to cool down and tempers were short Cue Karen  She came up with her grandkids and started complaining how there was nowhere to sit and other people were getting their families to save tables while they queued which apparently wasnt fair  I informed her we didnt police the seating area and it was a busy weekend She scowled and handed over her food and then started hovering around an elderly couple until they left to grab their table Now  we usually give a small side salad with paninis and toasties but we were so busy we had ran out and only had tomatoes and cucumbers and so I plated up her food and dropped it off at her table and made my way back to the till She came marching up to me and starting yelling at me for trying to stiff her and how everyone else had salad leaves and that how stupid I was that I couldnt even put leaves on a plate All the while her grandkids where complaining they were hungry and just wanted to eat I apologised  explaining the salad was free and we were out of leaves but she wasnt having it and just kept yelling until I was on the verge of tears When she saw this I think she realised the scene she was making and deflated slightly before taking the food and leaving the cafe I had to excuse myself to the back storage room and had a cry as I had never been exposed to such anger over something so stupid This was the only retail job where I was screamed at and I still cant understand it,2557,486
971,hkf89s,1,0,This week I met a male Karen  First story I decided topost on here First of all I work in a bigger construction store here in Germany  trained in the gardening section and now stuck being a cashier So last wednesday  I was working my usual shift and waiting for a customer to show  It was a usual day of idiots and nice people showing up every now and then  Since they werent storming in and I didnt have any people waiting in line at the moment  I sat down and crossed my legs Then it happens and this guy shows up  being a bit rude and not greeting me back  when he reached my counter  I didnt mind it  because usually people are less talkative with those face masks  He places his only item on the counter and I scan it  ask him if that was all he wanted to buy and he angrily grabs a bag and almost slams it onto the counter  I scan that also since bags are  cents each and tell him his total  Be whips out his card and pays In the meantime I opened the bag  since they are usually a pain to open  But I didnt place his item  A bigger canister with a carrying handle  inside the bag  but asked him  wether I should hold the bag open for him  so he could place it inside easier Cue the Karen start up  From now on Ill be referring to him as MK  Male Karen  and me is me  S for supervisor and B for Boss  MK  You know thats your job  not mine Me  I give him a puzzled look MK  Packing my bag is your job  despite all the Corona non sense  Me  For further clarification  My counter is protected by a glass window with a small space underneath where I can grab and turn items to scan them  That also makes it really hard for me to pack items into a bag  despite it not being my actual job  Im sorry what  MK  Packing my bag is your job  And stop rolling your eyes The costumer is always right  You should know that  I am a sales trainer  I know what your job is  but you apparently dont Me  Alright  You should also know that it is not my job  Also  only as long as you behave  I will treat you with respect MK  Call your boss here now  I will wait  Also your sitting position tells me  you dont even wanna do your job  You arent interested in doing your job at all  like those damn people your age are anyways   I am a  year old female  but I appear to be a bit younger Me  Gadly   I start calling my boss  who said he was busy and couldnt come there now  so I should call my supervisor  Which I did At this point in time a line starts building in front of the register and MK tells the customers to walk up front to a different register  because  This will take a long time  I am not moving So my supervisor was busy at the entry and taking care of other peoples problems and told me to send MK to the front I told MK  that my supervisor was waiting at the front for him and should go there MK  No  it is my right as a customer  I demand someone to come to me  I will not move The customers told MK to move aside so I could do my job and he just placed his hands on the counter to further make clear he wont move So another worker and I start calling the boss again  because this guy wont move and keeps verbally attacking me Me  on the phone looking around the section  Usually Boss is walking around in the gardening section  but I dont spot him MK leans around my glass wall and stares at my face Me  lowering the phone from my ear  Excuse me  but what I am looking at is none of your business MK  The only thing thats missing now is that you start crying Me  Alright   I hang up the phone and stare at him  Telling the customers in line that I am sorry  but I am unable to work with this guy in my face MK suddenly turns around and starts walking out of the store in a fast pace  Then my boss arrives B  Wheres the customer you called me here for earlier Me  Just saw you and left B  Mustve not been that important then  Boss left Customers in line were sorry for me having to deal with MK and kept telling me  that he was at fault and just rude towards me And that concludes the story of how I met a male Karen  demanding the manager  talking about his right as a customer and so forth,4175,795
972,hk7egt,1,19,Underwear in Dressing Rooms   My friend told me some of the craziest retail stories when he worked at a Department Store  which is no longer in business   This one  is probably the craziest one ever  It was in the early s  He was working at the Kids Department  A mother and her  year old son   NOT a Karen   flagged him at the dressing room and said there is a problem On the floor of one of the dressing room was a boy’s white underpants  They looked at each other  “Are you going to pick it up ” The mother said “I need to get a glove first  Who knows if that thing is dirty or not  I’ll call my manager  Please don’t touch anything ” He told her  and walked away He later returned with the manager as he picked up the underpants and place it in a bag  He was surprise that he saw that the mother was still there  “Sorry for the wait ”Later  another customer approached us holding an open package of boys white briefs and asked  “Why are we selling open package of underwear  with one pair missing ”At this point  they figured out that an idiot customer open a package of underwear  have them try it on in the dressing room  and then left it there ”The boy asked  “Who does that ” Everybody shrug  Needless to say  my cousin’s manager was very upset for this strange theft  Or whatever you call it,1320,241
973,hk5u1z,1,23,Got yelled at for asking a customer to maintain his distance A couple of days ago I was at work  I’m a cashier at a garden centre  I get this old man and lady come to my till  I’m guessing he’s    The first thing out of his mouth is that he wanted something out of the locked cabinet  Now only a few people are allowed to have the key as it contains chemicals and poisons  and its mandated by law that the person taking the item out of the cabinet has to tell the customer how to use it I attempted to tell him that while I don’t have the key  I can call someone who can help him  I got as far as saying “I can’t”  before he began to yell at me  He was saying that it says to ask a cashier  aren’t you a cashier  Now I hate to be interrupted  I think it’s rude  So immediately I’m pissed but I’m trying not to show it  I tell him that I was trying to tell him I’ll get help for him  I proceed to call  the lady runs off to get what they wanted  and I continued to ring up the rest of their items  I did have to tell him after the initial yelling to please stand behind the bright yellow line that’s in place for where customers need to stand  I could tell he didn’t like being told that  but he complied  Btw he was not wearing a face covering  you know the word the starts with an m and ends in a k  While I was bagging their things and standing to the side of my till where there’s no plexiglass  the old man decided that was the right time to take his basket and place it beside me where one other basket was  At no point during this  did he stay away the recommended distance As I say to all customers who think they can be closer to me than my own kids  I said please stay behind the yellow line  With that he freaking loses it  and yells at me that he had to put away his basket  I told him not to yell at me  that it was for his safety and mine  He doesn’t say a word  The garden centre manager comes up to me and asks if I was alright  I said yes  she goes up to him and reiterates what I just said  Of course there’s no mention of him yelling at me The lady with him never said a word about his behaviour to him or me  I’m wondering if he’s abusive to her too and her way of coping is to just ignore it Please  when shopping  pay attention to where the lines or X’s are  They are there for a reason  Yes I know this is a strange new world  and we have to learn a new way to shop  but don’t yell at the employee when asked to do something  The rules are there in place,2497,509

977,hjt41w,1,0,Kid coughs directly into my face Hi  this is my first post in this section so please let me know if I mess up on formatting or names I work in a bookstore in Australia which didn’t have to shut down during the outbreak  We’re currently in a second wave right now which is making things difficult A woman came in with her child and proceeded to pull every Bluey book off the shelf  if you don’t know the character  it’s a current cartoon on tv that kids are going crazy for  so he could look at them  And  by look  I mean rub his hands over all of them  cough and generally be gross  Note  the child was about  or  so I don’t have issues with him not understanding the gravity of the situation The mother was a talker so brought me over to talk about the books  She then launched into a complaint that the kindergarten his little sister went to hadn’t taught her to read and write yet because “that isn’t my job  it’s theirs ”I nodded  pretending to look interested  She picked her son up and held him on her hip  She then complained about his school not having enough “screening” for any sick kids coming in and that her son had gotten sick from one of the other students who had the flu I basically became that side eye meme where I looked at him and then back at her   I have asthma and I live with someone who is high risk when it comes to the current virus so I’ve had to be very careful The child looks straight at me and coughs  Not just a small cough or with any attempt to cover his mouth  Just a straight  chunky cough right into my face  his mother wasn’t really adhering to social distancing either so it was a real face full   I look at his mother in shock and she says  “See  Sick ”I had been expecting her to tell him to cover his mouth or turn his head away  We were in the middle of a pandemic after all  or at least from basic respect for other people  I don’t blame the kid because he was young and when things haven’t been explained or they haven’t been told not to do something  it’s not an action he’d fix by himself at that age She had the gall to complain about the other kids not being screened but had no issue with her kid spreading a virus  I asked if it was “just the flu” to see if he’d been tested and she waved it off about all this “virus drama”  She wasn’t attacking me but was acting like the world was “crazy” for not wanting to get sick So  to protect the bookstore  myself and the people I live with  I had to go get tested Thankfully  I was clear even though I did end up with a rotten cold from the situation It was just so shocking to me that she didn’t care what he had or if he was spreading it  Good thing was that she bought a few books which really helped the bookstore out so I can’t complain about that,2774,532

982,hjfaw0,1,3,Trying to spice up retail backfires This was several years ago  I was working in a supermarket at the tills checkouts  This  as Im sure many of you know  is a fairly dull task and chances are youre stuck there for hours  For context  I have a strong British accent  This was a fairly small shop and we mostly just get regulars buying their weekly shopping One day I decided on a whim to try something new  When the next customer I didnt recognise came up to me to be served I said  Hello  Welcome to   supermarket    how are you today   I said in the first accent that came to mind  It was Russian  I am not very good at this accent The lady gave me an odd look before answering  She didnt have many items so it didnt take very long to finish the transaction  but there was enough for a small conversation to be necessary  Thank you  have a nice day  I said in a  Russian  accent that had by no means improved since my first attempt  The lady mumbled some thanks and left the shop  I decided that I would definitely not be trying that again  it was pretty awkward Fast forward to tomorrow  Im working my magic at the tills when the same lady comes in and buys some more things  Im far to stubborn to admit I was faking it so when she greets me I don a hopefully not too dissimilar accent to yesterday  Hello again  how are you today   Yup  still a terrible attempt  What an idiot  Im exhausted  My husband and I have just moved in to the area and are very busy unpacking at the moment  I expect Ill be in here a lot more often as I live just around the corner    amp  xB Anyway  long story short I doubled down and carried on with the accent for the remainder of my time in that shop  I can only imagine the confusion of anyone standing behind her in the queue when I greet them in perfect English,1828,335

987,p9jb15,0,1,Went no contact with my dad and wrote an email stating that he needs to get help for his condition  This was his response  Im so mad and just feel utterly hopeless about him ever changing  For the time I saw my dad as he truly is and that he will never acknowledge my heartache and the abuse I and my siblings suffered at his hands  Despite this  I still cant shake this stupid  learned behavior that I need to consider my dads feelings while he can walk all over mine  My letter outlined  with specific examples  the negative impacts on my life hes had  I was homeless at  and he didnt once think to reach out and see how I was doing or offer to help   out of  of his kids have now decided to go no contact with him  Anyways this was his response nothing to be It is very difficult to respond to your letter   Your letter covers two decades of heartache that I was unaware of  and has me grieving the loss of our relationship that never was The pain described in your letter and your decision to go no contact leaves me deeply saddened  Especially now… as you said there are many things left unspoken between us Your letter was heartfelt  well written and triggers a sense hopelessness in me  With so much content to process all I can say right now is I love you nothing to be We live in difficult times that are hard to navigate  The world today is so much different than it was in the recent past  All this is driving a need within me to reconnect with God  Who unfortunately  I’ve been running from since my darkest years that culminated in divorce from your mom In your letter you describe your experiences and memories  those  belong to you and you alone   That’s how your memories feel to you  that’s how you remember them  Also in your memories you presume to know my thoughts  Those don’t belong to you  you can’t possibly know my inner thoughts and motivations  I would go so far as to say you don’t really know me The absence of hate isn’t love nothing to be  I wish things could be different between you and me  Maybe we could talk about it someday  You have had a long time to consider this and have your reasons  I respect your request for autonomy  So  until my heart is right with God and He influences my path  I will need time before I can willingly consider action that further contributes to the sadness and vulnerability I feel today I love you nothing to be …dad,2414,437
988,p9j3h2,0,1,I just can’t get a break I recently had to move back in with my nparents with my dog  There’s also two siblings that live with them that are in elementary school  They acted nice at first trying to push me to move in with my friend but my friend said there was too much going on with their family and house so understood  I told my nstepmom cause she was saying before that they would be happy to give me a place but the moment she received the news she flipped sides and showed that she didn’t want me here  She gave me a lot of stipulations while saying “but you’re an adult so it’s not like you have to do all the things you did as a teenager” but she manipulated me into rehoming my dog saying she only wanted the best for him but she actually just wanted me to get rid of him and didn’t give me other options  She eventually put me in a situation where I had to stay at a friend’s house while I figured out a home for my dog  I ran out of time so I just had to leave my dog at my friends’ and they said they’d help me and figure it out for me in order to take it off my hands  I came back to my nparents’ house today without the dog and my nstepmom accused me of dumping him on the side of the road  when I got home she ignored all my texts asking if she was home and when my little sister tried to talk to me my nstepmom wouldn’t let her and yelled at her  I feel like later in the evening they’re going to sit me down for an old fashioned talk where they just make me feel like scum and probably to tell me that I need to find somewhere else to live  All the while my dad never says anything  I’m really afraid cause I’m starting to feel like they’re watching me  I wouldn’t be surprised if they found out about this post,1729,353

1005,p9h41c,0,1,Dreaming of narc grandma Three years ago I started noticing the mask falling off of my narcassitic grandmother  I went no contact for a number of reasons  Major reasons • My mom had me at  and tricked into signing over guardianship to my grandparents  • I didnt meet my biological dad until I was  because my grandparents threatened to literally kill him  They held him at gun point  For  years my grandparents said he was a consistent drug addict and that he cheated on my mom  He wasnt  He is very stable  only smoked pot here and there through high school  Dad was a cop who suspected my mom was being sexually abused by grandpa  which she was  I believe this is why they actually ran him out of town  • I always confided in my grandma as a child about my step dad abusing me  My grandma lied to everyone and told my mom nothing was happening despite my constant confessions of abuse  I was abused for  years     When I was a teen  my grandma gave my mom constant advice for my  acting out   Resulted in a lot of beatings and different medications that led to a drug problem  Grandma was playing both sides of the field by telling my mom I was a rebellious teen and telling me that my mom didnt love me and that she was always there for me to act on my behalf  Learned all of this at  after I went no contact after meeting my dad  My mom also went no contact and we got closer    despite her being a terrible mother for years  Thats another post for another day  •  months after having  contact  I started having terrible nightmares of abuse that happened before I was  or   I was wetting the bed and waking up screaming  I had such an abusive childhood that I blocked so much out for years  Went to therapy and added another abuser to list  There is honestly so much more and I feel like I could type all day  I just wanted to give a little background Im having what feels like nightmares because in my dream Im talking with my grandparents and either defending my experience or my moms  Its like its in the future and I know she is narcissist but Ive given her another chance  We talk about the years I didnt talk to her and then we just carry on  I feel like Im going crazy  Last night I dreamed that my grandma had convinced me that I was wrong about her being a narc and I missed time with her  It was like all of the love bombing wasnt love bombing and it was real  Like I woke up thinking  what if she really wasnt that bad and Ive cut out the only person that ever cared for me growing up   Ive been stuck on the couch all day with racing thoughts  My only way to cope with this kind of thinking is to remember every little fucked up thing shes ever done  Has anyone else experienced this,2748,523

1009,p9gtde,0,1,Should I go no contact   Read in full if you give an answer  Ill try to keep a long story short but not spare important details  Essentially  I feel disrespected and pushed around by my siblings constantly  so much that I had to tell my mother because she caught me on the verge of a literal breakdown last month  When I told her about how my siblings were making my fight or flight flare up more and more  she essentially said  get help  and nothing else  I asked her multiple times to talk with my siblings  she said yes  which later turned into her not wanting to because  It makes her anxiety act up to get involved in drama   I told her I felt like if I were to become so bad mental health wise and end my life  I dont have these thoughts  just a hypothetical  that nobody would know how it got to be that bad  She said itd leave alot of trauma and that we should talk about it as a family  which never happened  because she said shes too anxious to bring us together to hash it out  So essentially  the massive split that caused me to tell my siblings to not talk to me anymore has never actually been resolved  Fast forward to us doing a family activity at the pool  Im minding my business rubbing in sunscreen when my sister aggressively tells me to stop standing over her  to which I calmly reply  Ill be away from you in a moment I just want to stretch and moisturize   My other siblings jump in  I calmly repeat and tell them Im not trying to make anyone uncomfortable and literally just want to do what I was doing before getting in the pool and being away from them for  minutes  In enters my mom  who scolds me in front of everyone  with more anger towards me than any of my siblings for any past aggression ever  I just feel beyond done  I plan on not sleeping in my home tonight because if I communicate why Im upset shell end up yelling and telling me Im  the problem child  then acting like nothing happened  Should I just go no contact  I already have the worst sibling blocked and Im not far behind adding the others to the list  Or am I overreacting  Please  be honest,2104,399
1010,p9gs2e,0,1,Nstep mom thinks her future baby is my  obligation     My father and I have always had a fairly rocky relationship  especially after him and my mother  separated   long story short   years have passed without them actually divorcing  though theyre both  engaged  to other people   Shortly after their separation  my ndad found a woman who was pretty nice at first  Since I was only  and my mother had moved out of state with her new  husband   I latched onto my new stepmom and was quite happy to have a  mom  figure to look up to  She didnt even seem to be a narc at first  though being with my ndad soon changed that  I think its called fleas  and both my nmom and now nstep mom have them  since they exhibit traits similar to the way my ndad has always been  but only after spending enough time around him    So  my ndad came into my room one day  right at the start of the Covid waves  last year  late winter  early spring  He screamed at me and my so for being lazy  and preceded to tell me hell be taking my door off the hinges to give me a reason to come out of my room  This was because me and my so were still relaxing at noon on a Friday  our school only went Mon Thurs   and were not yet up and cleaning his house     I still dont know what in me made me do it  but after years of putting up with him barging in or beating down my door to scream at me  that day Id finally had enough  and I asked my so if I could stay at his grandparents house for a few weeks     Though my nmom turned my life upside down from there  my nstep mom was the sole supportive family member  and had told me the whole   if thats what you think is best for you  then go ahead   line  So a year passed with me stuck at nmoms until Im almost    very long story  before moving back in with my so  where Ive spent the past ish months    The surprising thing is  though no one saw a problem with me not doing my senior year at my nmoms house  as soon as Id moved back with my so  my whole family just had to tell me how badly Id failed them for not sticking with school and   just hunkering down and getting it done   I quickly got my stuff together though  getting my drivers license and Ged within the first few months  though my nfamily all had the same sentiment of  a GED isnt nearly as good as a diploma  how are you supposed to get into college with that     Of all the family members disappointed in me  I was only surprised by one  Nstep mom tried to be  nice   while telling me every other sentance how much my little sister   a severely autistic  year old  misses me  and how I should come  visit  her on an all expense paid  vacation  Since my nstep mom used to understand how much stress and anxiety my family gives me  I was shocked when she blew up on me  and acted offended that I wouldnt accept her generous request    That happened a few months ago  and at about the same time she had sown the seeds for the title    yes I am getting there  but it makes no sense out of context       So my nstep mom and my ndad are living in ndads home city  a days drive from where I live  and I have no vehicle  Nstep mom came from where Im living now  so shes been quite out of her element in ndads big city  and  while we spoke on the phone  would make it clear she was unhappy there  She had no friends or family there  and deep down always wanted a horse  yes  a horse  Now  that wouldnt be a problem  except the fact that my ndad cant care for ANY animal  let alone children       Anyways  during a phone call with nstep mom  she had asked me how Id feel if her and my dad had a baby  Keep in mind  Im  and my father has ALWAYS treated me like a burden  not to mention told me that Ill be caring for  the little r tard   yes both my parents have always called my little sister that  I grew up thinking it was normal   So when my nstep mom said that  I had no clue what to say  and first stuttered out something like    sure  thatd be nice  I was in such deep shock I couldnt think  and I think  weeks passed before I texted her again   And once I did  she was even worse than before  She tried hard to guilt trip me about my sister  telling me how much she missed me  how shed been asking for me  and how hard it is to take care of her every other week  Dont get me wrong  I do miss my sister too and really want to see her  but putting pressure on me to come visit her on everyone elses time  while Im trying to get a job and save for a car    it just cane across as selfish  and after the baby thing      So I sent her a long paragraph explaining that  this is the reason we havent spoken in weeks  You put alot of stress on me and I cant really handle it right now     It honestly broke my heart the way she responded  she basically went on a long tangent about how SHE just wanted me to come and have a nice  vacation   and how she wouldnt be offering me a vacation like this again    I then reiterated that helping with my little sister and jumping through the families hoops is anything but a vacation  and for her to please stop offering it  I also  heaven forbid  mention something about how I dont have a support system down there and need to focus on getting support   All of this caused my nstep mom to seethe with rage  and she merely responded   I see    Me  Sorry I just dont like not telling people what going on in my head  since it is such a mess  and I know if my dad one half of what my life is he wouldnt accept it     No Im not a stripper  I just have a trans bf    Nstep mom  All I have to say is if you have to hide your life  you arent doing it right  Live a life you are proud to share with everyone  And last thing  a job or college arent the only paths to success  but they are the only options to survive  Dont make a fool out of yourself trying to prove everyone wrong   And lastly  dont worry I wont be a support system for you anymore since it seems I never was  Good luck on your own  maybe  sos dead name  will be able to help you adult  Im out Me  I mean  I have to hide it from the abusers Im related to  so theres not much I can do there  aside from that I am proud of my life  And of course jobs are necessary  no sh t  but I cant hack a full time right now and thats whats important  And what the f ck are you talking about  youve never been a support system   I mean that line speaks for itself  You were a good support system  but now youve become like my father and and I dont even know  youre thinking this is somehow an attack on you  And yeah  my boyfriend  sos real name  has made it easier and greatly helped me learn how to adult  as you used to before you were all full of obligations for me  I hope you are happy with my father  but after youimplied that I could stay with him for   months  I realized youre in a completely different headspace    After that  she sent a slightly shorter text about all the obligations of life  basically saying  Im sorry you cant handle having obligations   though what effing obligations is she talking about  Im obligated to drop what Im doing and help her care for my little sis AND her baby      Just wanted to post this cause  though Im used to my parents acting like this  I was broken when she did this     I thought I at least had one  parent,7329,1457

1021,p9fhlv,0,1,Advice needed Hi everyone  I have recently decided I need to try a way to cut ties with my parents completely  Its like Im suddenly realizing and understanding how deeply messed up I was treated as a child and even now as an adult  Im only    I have current health issues and I spoke to my doctor about this and she said I can even tell my parents its doctors orders to take a break from them for at least  weeks  and that what I have isnt just PTSD from my childhood but it is just considered ongoing psychological abuse at this point   I just really need some advice on how to do so  My parents currently help me financially by letting me remain on their health insurance  this is a major one for me due to having health issues and I know paying for my own insurance would leave me with higher copays for medications in addition to paying for the insurance itself  and my job doesnt offer insurance plans with any decent mental health coverage   paying for my car insurance  the car is paid off   and I am still on their phone plan  I do live on my own and pay for my apartment and bills associated with it and just daily living expenses on my own  Ive debated trying to go low contact or very low contact  but I dont even know how to say that without my parents flipping their lids  Its mostly my mom  its just nonstop expecting I speak to her on the phone at least  times a day and when I dont I have to explain myself as to why we didnt talk  I get guilt tripped constantly with nonstop gaslighting  All my mom does is nonstop call me to rant and basically suck all emotional energy I have  and Ive been grey rocking her nonstop which just makes her say things to upset me and try to get me to interact and fly off the handle at her  which then turns around to me being the liar  being manipulative  putting words in her mouth she never said  etc    Ive been in therapy for about  to  years now  just in the interim looking for a new therapist currently   and I really dont think I am any of those things because I think a therapist would have pointed that out to me by now  Is it better for me to just endure dealing with them for now so I get some financial support  this makes me feel guilty  but I also kind of feel ok with it after dealing with a life of bullshit from my family   I really dont think Id mind just having contact once a week or so  When I lived with my parents growing up I really do feel that my mom told my dad things so he would fly off the handle towards me  since moving out and being on my own my father and I havent had a single issue  we talk maybe once a week or once every other week and its usually short  I still hold some anger towards him since he was verbally pretty mean growing up and things got physical a few times  and dont want to be close but I think he is fine with not being close anyway and he always tells me Im an adult I can do whatever I want at this point   My dad anyway is the one who provides any financial support  when I chose to go to college my mom attacked me for trying to get back at them by only applying to expensive schools to just further drain them but my dad told me that its up to me and hes the one paying anyway so to ignore her   Im sorry this is kind of everywhere  I just really dont know exactly what to do in this situation  I always end up letting my mom in again thinking things are different and better but then I am always let down in the end  but things just really feel different this time and Im really ready to limit end contact  Does anyone have any advice  Thank you,3590,702

1023,p9f7kt,0,1,Is this considered verbal abuse  Ill just get to the point of this  My parents are the type of parents who says crying means youre weak  They can be sometimes judgemental too and ones who sometimes gossip behind your back  Back in  I was already dealing with being bullied and feeling isolated in school from my peers  At home I did so too  Being home use to be place where I felt comfortable being myself  I use to be kid who cared and say I love you mom and dad whenever I sleep and gave out hugs  Compared to now its not the same for me  I seriously hate it and thinking about some of these things makes me hate myself sometimes  When I felt depressed for first time in  from having tough time making friends and trying fit in within my peers  When I tried tell my parents about it  they wouldnt believe me that I was depressed  I honestly cried from that point when my parents denied me what I was feeling and going through  They called me weak  bitch  a sussie   youre nothing blah blah all because I cried and tried tell them I was depressed  I ran to my room and cried and cried so much  I felt sad and frustrated with myself in life  I honestly punched and slapped my face out of frustrations and felt so low in my life in th grade  For first time in my life I felt alone with no friends and no parents thats there to comfort you or at least talk things out  I stayed in my room for days  only came out to eat and go back to my room without a word  With me being bullied at school and not being able tell your parents without being called weak  Made me felt like I was at my breaking point of my life  I was truly at my lowest point of life  where I had thoughts hurting myself  What stopped me from harming myself was being afraid of hurting myself Even when its about things like Im older than you I know more than you  Whenever Im right about something or appeared to do my research or just know a lot about the subject  Theyll call me know it all or get mad about it  Theyll just put me down about it  Whenever I enjoy something or found something I liked  my parents would often make fun of me and say this is weak or this is stupid  why youre watching that etc  From there the last ounce of me being comfortable around my parents ended  It was like a switch turned off to me  I use to feel comfortable and open being with my parents  Now its like I feel out of touch with them  Where Im quiet and often feel uncomfortable talking things to them  Even the simplest things like shaving makes me feel uncomfortable to asked them about  Even when something happen to me  I always feel hesitate to talk to my parents about certain things  Which is why I mostly keep to myself  I always know whatever I tell my parents about something I want to be kept between me and them  theyll straight up be ready tell the whole family  The word just spreads crazy to everyone in the family  Its one of the reasons why I feel uncomfortable towards them  Example  I know this can be embarrassing to some people  I loved Professional Wrestling ever since I was a kid  I use to watch Raw or Smackdown every Monday and Friday night  Whenever my dad comes out to see it  hell make fun of me watching it  Would often make comments about it and laugh about it  If I tried to say something about it  hell get mad about it  Automatically say Im talking back when I was just trying explain myself  From there my dad ruined my love for professional wrestling  which was something at least I looked forward to watch every week in my life  Even on my birthdays they always find a way to ruin it for me  My last birthday my dad often picked on me for smallest things and yelled at me on my birthday  Overall I look back at myself feeling lost in this world due to me feeling isolated from my family  and my peers  I feel so empty and drained  Where Im use to this feeling of emptiness  like I cant say I love you anymore  I often have aneixty attack and depression on my shoulders  I cant really word everything that happened within past few years  I dont understand why I cant but this is all I can say about it  The last person I ever felt comfortable going to was my grandmother  She was always there for me whenever I needed her when I was little  In the future I do plan on seeing therapist when ever I can  This is just glimpse of what I felt and experienced but Is this considered verbal abuse or somewhat,4447,849
1024,p9f1fg,0,1,Asking Nparents for help knowing they wont Has anyone had that experience  when your nparent needs help he she expects you to drop everything and solve their problem  But when you ask for something once a year its a major inconvenience and they let you know youre bothering them  So after noticing that I tried something  asked my nmom to lend me a nice sum of money  that I actually dont need   So naturally an argument ensued and now we dont talk  I assume she thinks I need the cash bad so Ill contact her again An interesting spin on the NC method I think  making them believe they are in control and are punishing you,631,114
1025,p9f0yv,0,1,Parents keep breaking promises  So a week ago I was supposed to return to college on Tuesday and help my girlfriend move in to our new apartment but my parents told me that it was too late    hours to get there    hrs total for my parents to go back and forth   and told me to reschedule  Luckily for me  my girlfriend was able to move in by herself  and although I felt really sorry  shamefully I said “ok  fine  I can reschedule” to my parents  even though they promised me that they will definitely drive me back on that day  When I chose last Saturday to go back  they started making excuses like  “oh  we need you to take care of chores because stepdad is busy  mind you  my mother has too many pets and my young brother that need a lot of care ” or “oh  we need you to take the animals to the vet on Sunday”  now that my gf was able to move out by herself  When I suggested I could use  paid by myself  public transportation  they flipped out and told me if I can’t even wait “a bit” just to go to campus  I’m so ungrateful and I’m not welcome in their house  Uh wtf  So I ended up not being able to go back last Saturday  and because the only apparent available day they had was this Saturday  yesterday   they told me they DEFINITELY can get me on campus by that time  Deja vu  because my parents came home too late  due to “stocking up pet supplies” that they didn’t even need yesterday and had today  Sunday  to get  and because it was too late to drive me and go back atp  without the restocking  I could have left home at pm  but my parents returned at pm  which is too late   They did try to attempt in telling me they could drive me yesterday night  and when I agreed that if they can drive me yesterday night then I would like them to  my school starts literally tomorrow  but they made snide comments like how I was a ungrateful girl who can’t think for how tired they would get driving me so late  how I will be basically disowned if I chose yesterday night  even how I’d never get a boyfriend with this kind of attitude  I’m not even straight…   etc I ended up just not wanting to argue anymore because the situation made me physically sick and dizzy  probably because of how much I was angry  even though I should be grateful to them to take time out to drive me back to college because I don’t have a car   I’m waiting today  but at this point I don’t even know   if I’m gonna get back to college lol,2436,469

1032,p9ehqg,0,1,Hit me because Im such an awful mum   Today I had yet another argument with my mum over something that is so insignificant  It also made me realize that my mum has narcissistic tendency  Note  Im raised in an Asian family so sometimes Im confused whether it is a mental illness or the culture thing  As a teen  I was sent to a boarding school in another state to fulfill my grandpas wish as he always wanted one of his grandchildren to be in the same state as him  When I graduated and moved back to the city  my friends soon ignored me and any attempts to be friendly with them ends up with cold shoulders  It stressed me out and the fact that I lost contact with my friends from my hometown just made me feel even more isolated  Not to mention my whole college years is online  So  the only person I could look up to for comfort and love is my mum  I told her how lonely I am and how I feel demotivated  Of course  since the problem never solved I kept telling her the same stories everytime I wanted to vent  which I try to keep on a minimum as to not frustrate her   This time  I was telling her how my bestfriends did not show up for game nights  made me wait for hours only to apologize the next morning  This has been going on for multiple times that I decided to let it out  We were in the kitchen trying to make dinner Me      And yeah sometimes I regret going to school at  state  because I have no friends here  The friends from  state  avoid me  Mum   You talk like your friends from  state  are evil and mean  Me   No  I did not  Mum   You just did by telling that statement  Me   Please stop putting words in my mouth  Mum   Look  you keep venting about the same things on and on and its going to make you mentally ill    Things went downhill from there  I tried to tell her that I just wanted to think about what she just said in silence  but she kept on ranting how I have a pessimistic view in life and that I might have issues  Its ironic since last week  I tried convincing my mum to send me to therapy but she said that Im just fine  Suddenly I am not  During the whole argument  she refused to listen to my points and continued talking until one point I raised my voice to tell her that I respect her as a mother  but she needs to consider my feelings  Oh  I was wrong for doing that This made her even more aggravated because she runs to me  grabs my arms and started to make me hit her while  screaming   IM AN AWFUL MOTHER  HIT ME  HIT ME BECAUSE IM A BAD PARENT   then she sat on the floor while mumbling   Maybe Im just about to have my menopause    She whispers some prayers to herself before washing her face and leaves the house  My younger siblings tried to search for her but then I stopped because she always does this whenever she had a fight  The fucked up part is  no matter who was right or wrong my mum will always paint me as that one sick  rebellious child to my younger siblings  I dont know what exactly she told them but whenever there is a disagreement  my siblings would think Im the bad one,3075,579

1034,p9ea7x,0,1,Outsmarting a narcissistic parent  Share your stories  We all know how it can seem almost impossible to beat a narcissistic parent at their own games  Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent  I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom  Feel free to share yours   I wrote about the following in a reply to someone elses post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent I grew up in the s and s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes  Even when I was elementary school aged  I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes  I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking  When I entered my teen years  I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore  She eventually stopped asking However  one day  I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends  My parents had no objection  Later in the day  my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends  I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore  I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing Anyway  her sweet demeanor suddenly changed  and through her clenched jaw  she informed me   Fine  Then you will NOT be using the car this evening   However  her threat didnt sway me  and I told her fine  I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said   Sorry  we cant go to the movie  My mom wont let me use the car because I wont go buy her cigarettes  Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend  her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment  The narcissist in my mom couldnt stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car  Her demeanor once again suddenly changed  and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line  she exclaimed with fake laughter   Oh wait  wait  Hold on  You know I was only kidding  Ha ha ha  So not only did I get to use the car after all  I semi shamed my mom  and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again   I have been living in Japan for about  years  I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family  Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me As you can imagine  it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year  plus spending money while Im there  etc  Despite this  I have never played the  poor card  and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket  My mom  on the other hand  has offered a number of times to either  chip in  or  go half  on the cost of a ticket  A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket  However  I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached  In fact  out of all these offers and in all my time living here  I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight About eight or nine years ago  the last time I ever accepted her offer   she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas  I initially refused and told her it wasnt necessary  However  she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent  She was going on about how she knows its a lot of money to come home twice a year  how she does things to help my sisters  but  because I live in Japan  she and my dad cant help me as much as they would like  etc I finally relented  but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad  which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do  before she went offering to buy an almost   dollar plane ticket for me  She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours When I phoned back  my moms caring and supportive attitude had completely changed  She was now using her half annoyed half righteous tone with me  the one where she elongates the last word in every clause sentence   So I talked to your faaatherrr  and he and I have deciiideeddd    She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden  She told me that she and my dad would  help me out  this time by paying for my ticket  but  its about time you considered moving back to Canada because we cant afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan  I thought to myself   Okay  here we go again   But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered  but if it were too much trouble  it wasnt necessary  and not to worry about   No  No  Thats fiiiine  Well buy your ticket this tiiiime  But you need to think about moving baaack   Of course  I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket  I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my moms attitude and he had no say in  their  decision that I should move back to Canada I got off the phone and though  F    it  Im not going back for Christmas   and I meant it  I waited until the next day  and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story  I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible  I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket  but it really wasnt necessary  It was so nice of him to support my moms offer to pay for my ticket  but I really didnt expect them to buy it  I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer  but it was too generous and I wouldnt be able to accept it  In fact  Ive decided to stay in Japan over the holidays Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad  my phone started ringing  Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return  I had apparently  misunderstood  what she had said  she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket  and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas  All I needed to do was book my ticket  let her know how much it would cost  and she would put the money on my credit card   When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a  bad back   in reality  she couldnt stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work   she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care   after school care because it was a waste of money  Appreciative of my moms offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month  my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer  Big mistake To give my mom credit  she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part  but even that has its limits when shes feeling like holding one of her pity parties  It doesnt help that my niece  since she was a small child and even now at  years old  is prone to outbursts  breakdowns  and temper tantrums  As my niece got a little bit older  my moms over reactions to my nieces over reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over react to the slightest misbehaviour When she was seven years old  my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school  and not to be outdone  my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself  She phoned my sister to work in hysterics  not the first time  literally bawling about my sisters  out of control  disrespectful  hateful  horrible child   you get the picture   And my mom sobbed on and on about how  I just cant take it anymore  Its just too much  Ive had enough  YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter  My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background  who knows where my dad had escaped to   My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone After getting off the phone  my sister realized that saving money on day care   after school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse  So before she went to pick up her kids  my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after school care for my niece and nephew When my sister arrived at my parents  my mom came running to the door in hysterics  her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind  ranting about my sisters ungrateful daughter   You need to do something about YOUR children  my nephew was now apparently caught up in this   WAAAA    As my sister is trying to get her kids coats and boots on  she told my mom to calm down and that  having a temper tantrum over your seven year old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isnt going to solve anything   My mom for the umpteenth time   YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter  I cant take it   WAAAA    At which point my sister told my mom to  grow up  and that she didnt need to  take it anymore  because from the next day  the kids would both be in after school care and walked out the door  At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming   No    No    Why     nieces name     No    Why     as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away My sister didnt go no contact with my mom after that  but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again  my sister refused and kept them in

1039,p9dyba,0,1,My mother isn’t allowing me to see my younger brother I’ve been no contact with my mother about two years now  It has been a roller coaster ride of emotions but mentally I have improved so much since I stopped interacting with her I am   My little brother is my half brother who still lives at home with my mother and step dad  He is   The last time I saw him was last year during a small wedding ceremony of one of my other brothers  He spent the whole reception with my husband and I discussing video games he was playing  We ended up buying him a video game that we thought he would like for his switch  He loved it Since that interaction my husband and I have been discussing how we would love to do things with him again  Before we went no contact with my mother we had started taking him out and doing stuff with him  We took him to a really cool old arcade and out to pizza  He had a blast and I heard after that outing his new favorite restaurant because the restaurant we took him too About a month ago my husband texted my mother to see if it would be possible to take my brother somewhere  We outlined that we are adults and would never talk bad about her or her husband to my brother  We just wanted to have a relationship with my brother and would love to work something out with them  A week passes and we don’t get a response  My husband reaches out again and same thing   No response We get another one of my brothers to ask her if she is receiving our messages  She said she was  He asked her if she was ever going to respond and she says no  This infuriates me and my husband  I had discussed with my therapist that if I didn’t get a response from my mother that I would start making care packages and give them to my brother to give to my youngest brother  We ended up picking out a card  candy  and a Nintendo gift card so he could get himself a game  While filling out the card I say fuck it  let’s go over  I want to give it to him myself You guys understand how hard that was for me  I haven’t seen that woman in two years  besides my brothers wedding   I was just so pissed that she was doing this   We get there and give him everything  My step dad calls us in the back yard  He acts normal  He tries to chit chat and be pleasant which I appreciated  My mom doesn’t say a word  Both my husband and I could tell she was irked  I mainly talk to my brother about how he’s been and what things he is in to now  Mainly video games and books   He’s such a smart and cute kid  Seeing him really made my week We didn’t stay long   only about   minutes  In that time my mother said not a word to me  A few days later I talked to my grandma and she lets slip that she had talked to my mom and she mentioned our visit  Apparently my brother was down before we got there but seeing us made him happy The next day my husband again reaches out to my mom to say I’m glad that my brother was happy after our visit and we would love to work something out with them to do something with him  She doesn’t respond  The following day   I break down and text her  I am polite  No response It infuriates me that she’s using my brother as a pawn to get to me  He is an innocent kid  All I know is that I am going to stop reaching out to her  I can’t do this anymore  It is upsetting me too much  I will write my brother letters and post cards and give him packages through my brother  I am going to document every thing I do in the hopes that when he gets older I can show him that I never stopped loving him or carrying about him  I just don’t want him to feel alone or abandoned like I did  I am so pissed off at my mother   More pissed off then anything she has ever did to me and she has done some mighty cruel things,3747,740

1045,p9dk8e,0,1,Parents are Narcissists  ruining my relationship My parents have caused a lot of issues in my relationship   Since my relationship with my girlfriend even started   I came out to my parents  🏳️‍🌈  I introduced my girlfriend to my family as my friend in the beginning because I was still in the closet   My girlfriend starting coming over for only a couple months in  then My parents told me that she can no longer stay the night   Which I thought was strange considering the fact we still went places and talked still  We don’t have a huge gap in our age   I am  now and my girlfriend is    I did move out the end of  and spent a lot of time with my girlfriend and her side of the family   not  Necessarily with my family because me and my girlfriend was always together   So if I would come over to my side of the family she wouldn’t be able to come inside so she would be in the car   This went on for the first half of our relationship   They would not speak to her at all which they did before  when I came out to my parents I didn’t get the greatest response   My mom said “  I have opened myself up to the devil  amp  sent me multiple bible scriptures   My Father said he figured it out and he hates my decision and that he is not proud of my decision   He said he doesn’t want my girlfriend around my sisters because he doesn’t want them seeing me with a girl is okay   Right then and there I should have said okay then I won’t come around because we are together   It doesn’t stop there   There a was a situation  months later where my mother feels as if my girlfriend disrespected her because my mother wasn’t listening to me  which has always been the issue even before my girlfriend came into the picture  so my gf basically said how she doesn’t listen to me and don’t get treated the same   My mom was so stuck on how does she know about the favoritism and shit  so of course I confided in my gf  On my graduation I almost didn’t get to walk because my mom was getting her nails done and time was cutting close  it was like she didn’t take it serious   When it came to my younger sister competition or practices being late is out of the question   So I have express this to my girlfriend   So she knew how I felt about my parents not listening to me and not receiving the same treatment as my siblings   She called my girlfriend a manipulator a devil multiple times  My mom called my dad and showed up not listening to anything I had to say he man handled me and threw me in the car and drove off   because Ihave never seen my parents completely out of character and took me away from my girlfriend   I was freaking out trying to explain to my dad what happened   He completely shut me down from trying to explain to him what happened and said he will take me back to the hospital if I continued    that day I was released from the hospital from  trying to commit Suicide the main reason was them not accepting me and they were FULLY AWARE of tha   he drove me to my grandma house and she made me read bible scriptures basically trying to push me to believe being gay isn’t right   They took my phone and car   car is in my name    because they felt like  “they were trying to protect me “  Still to this day they feel like they were just trying to protect me  because I was weak and not in  my right mind   I didn’t talk to my parents for a whole year   And in that one year all my parents could do was make assumptions of why I wasn’t talking to them  In there minds they think “ my girlfriend was keeping me from them “ in reality it was them who caused this to happen   When I wasn’t talking to them my dad came to my home and wrote his name on a piece of paper and put it in the driver seat   He still has my back up key to my car   He didn’t knock on my door nor tell me he was coming   He disconnected my phone because I wasn’t talking to him   I believe he forgot that he told me something otherwise   They try to justify there behavior all the freakin time   It’s like they constantly blame my girlfriend for everything and try to view my girlfriend as this negative person because to them “ she disrespected my mom” which she didn’t   I am mentally tired of there assumptions and how much they have caused in my relationship  My girlfriend feels like she is reason that my relationship with my parents is the way that it is now is her fault and I tried explaining to her no it’s them   I don’t know how to get her to understand that they caused this by what they did and what they say   Still to this day my dad keeps saying he rather me be with a male   Ask strange questions like does my girlfriend have anger issues   And asking me if I am eating   Like mentally I feel like I can’t deal  Me and girlfriend did come to conclusion that they were reading our messages because I already know my parents track me because they have in the past … I am trying to figure out what boundaries I need to set to get pass this,4956,1005
1046,p9dizm,0,1,Does anyone else wish it was worse so you could justify your negative feelings   LONG  Hi everyone  I just discovered this sub and after reading so many similar experiences I feel really understood  Thanks for setting this up  heres my piece My parents were never physically abusive  and they have a tendency to love bomb after doing something wrong  which makes me question what my own instincts tell me about their behavior  For example  they basically made me visit them over the summer and a few months ago they came downstairs at midnight while I was playing video games and proceeded to scream at me until am  wouldnt take any self defense which they framed as me being selfish and disliking it when I was called out  wore me out until I simply just told them what they wanted to hear to make them stop  and the next day gave me a blank check to go out to dinner and a bar with some old high school friends  all fully vaccinated and masked  Meanwhile  they wont give me the simplest of apologies  The same trip home I jokingly told my mother about a time a few years ago when I put off watching Good Omens for months because she said in one text that she wanted to see it  only for her to get bored of it in  episode  Which felt kind of shit at the time since I was looking forward to it and wanted to show her the adaptation of my favourite book  but isnt an abusive action by any means  When I brought it up though  she heavily implied that I was making up false memories  She couldnt even apologize over a tv show  but will scream at me until am and expects me to apologize for things that arent even wrong  but she thinks they are because I dont perfectly conform to exactly what she wants me to do about things involving my own damn life Still  theyve never laid a finger on me  I come from a pretty comfortable upper middle class background since my grandfather was big in the oil industry during a lot of lucky boom years so I never hurt for material things  I always had a big  warm roof over my head and nice new family cars  I always had food  heating  clean water  a safe neighbourhood to bike around in  new clothes  and those REALLY expensive shoes and winter coats that last for years  I got the latest game consoles for birthdays and went on twice yearly vacations to places like Sri Lanka and New York City  I went to a private high school and they let me move to the other side of the world for a pricey university  I was able to come and go as I pleased growing up with the freedom of transit passes and a pretty lax curfew  I had a lot of great things and opportunities basically handed to me that a lot of  if not most  kids dont get  so in a lot of ways  I feel like Im a spoiled  ungrateful  toxic piece of shit for feeling the way I do about my parents actions  Because I got all these great things by luck of birth lottery  but I still struggle to return an  I love you   They never restricted my movement  but they would snoop through my journals and somehow get through my laptop password when I was away  If they found anything they didnt like  it was justified  and sometimes they would act like a family emergency happened just so I would get home quicker  thinking someone was dead  only to get cornered and yelled at for hours because they invaded my privacy  To this day  they say it was justified  We would go on long expensive vacations to new countries to explore the world  but if I expressed any distress about how they treated me  they would bring those up and call me an ungrateful asshole because to them  throwing enough money at your kid negates anything wrong you might have done  I remember a dinner one night when I was  where  after they had gone through my phone without permission and read all my texts to my friends where I had expressed how I didnt feel supported by their extremely negative reaction to my coming out to them  they said  Sure  we send you and your friends to comic con last week with  bucks and a ticket to meet William Shatner  but I guess we dont support you   To this day  they deny how they reacted when I told them I was trans Now  their tune on that has changed a bit because they know they cant stop me anymore  but they still act as though I need to defer to them how my own transition works  They act like Im evil and vindictive for being out and open before I told them again at the age of   Like I need to put my own life and happiness on hold and continue living a horrible lie because they werent personally comfortable with it yet I feel like they think that  just because they gave me more than enough material things and never hit me  that was enough  As if material objects and enough money thrown at someone was a substitute for genuine connection  And now  I just cant forgive them for how they treated me in the past  but they wont even acknowledge it ever happened  and if they do  they pull the  youre the real bad guy because this hurts my feelings   I got a lot of hugs and I love yous  but they felt empty when they were contrasted against their actions towards me I find myself genuinely wishing sometimes that they were physically abusive  just so I could feel like my feelings are justified  As if this would only be valid if I was beaten and scarred by them  because its hard to believe the kid who had everything would rather be anywhere else  especially when all the stories you hear about narc abuse come from kids with less fortunate backgrounds  But the truth is  I would rather have a loving and understanding and poor family than what I got Does anyone else get this  Like your feelings arent justified and youre just a piece of shit because so many other people wouldve killed to have some of the things you did,5776,1070

1056,p9c6ij,0,1,I no longer need Nmom  and I feel free Im   and last year I moved into the college dorms for my freshman year  Now as a sophomore  I’m living in an apartment and I’m entirely financially independent  While in the process of signing my lease  Nmom kept making remarks like  “I’ll still need to help you”  and “Wait and see  you can’t afford to live on your own”  I honestly considered getting her help and dealing with her BS for another year or so  but I knew that if I did that  her arbitrary rules and strings attached would still make life miserable  Now that I’ve been in my apartment since May  and got a higher paying job   she’s starting to realize I don’t need help and has turned to starting arguments and trying to control tiny aspects of my life  Meanwhile I’m pulling away from her  because I’m dealing with relearning how to live without being in survival mode constantly  I don’t have to be scared if I’m hungry later at night and wanna make food  I don’t live in a hoarder house boarding on squalor  I don’t hear comments about how much I’m eating  or what I’m wearing  and after seeing what life should have been like my entire life and childhood  the feeling of resentment and hatred is so strong  I’m also nannying now  so seeing how loving parents act towards their kids  and feeling such an instinct to protect the little kiddo is making even more resentment for me  How can anybody abuse or belittle a kid  Or let them live in a hoarder house with mold while letting the water and electricity go off  I’ve never felt actual anger towards her before  usually it was pity or just sadness that she put me through so much  but right now  I’m so angry at her and everyone who ignored our screaming matches and the words she yelled at me with the windows open,1777,328

1058,p9bvs6,0,1,How do you all explain your relationship with your nparent s  to your significant other  This may be a question which has already been asked here in the past  My boyfriend and I have been together for  years  By now  he knows a lot of details about my Ndad and what a difficult relationship I have with him  but there are still some moments where my bf doesn’t seem to quite understand the relationship or my thoughts actions surrounding my behavior with my Ndad  and the problem for me is  as I know a lot of us have experienced  that I sometimes don’t really understand my own emotions around it so idk how to explain it to my bf  For example  it’s been very difficult for my bf to understand why I am still in contact with my Ndad  The reality for me right now is that I feel like it’s just easier this way for many reasons  Thankfully  I live in another state from my Ndad  so I’ve been able to gain a lot more control of my own life and keep some distance from him  and I also know that if I attempt going NC  my Ndad would find a way to make my life miserable again  Maybe one day I will find a way to cut off all communication  but as it currently stands  I would essentially have to disappear and restart my life all over again if I wanted to go NC  I’ve told this to my bf  which he still doesn’t seem to fully understand  but has at least accepted as an answer for now  However  there are still moments where I will make certain comments that seem to confuse him  which I understand because I have a lot of conflicting emotions surrounding my Ndad as well  and I don’t really know how to explain them to someone who isn’t in this situation  As we all know  one of the hallmark traits of narcissists is making themselves the victim of every situation and throwing the blame around for their actions to other people  most often the real victim themselves  in our case  the victims being their children   So that creates a lot of confusing feelings for us growing up because we end up feeling guilty and responsible for situations that we didn’t cause  And narcissists know how to make you feel sorry for them as well too  so we grow up simultaneously feeling like we have the blame for things that are out of our control but also resenting the people who make us feel guilty  Like a constant battle between feeling like the perpetrator and the victim at the same time  The other day  I made a comment to my bf about feeling sorry for my Ndad about a current situation he is having surrounding his house  which could cost him a lot of money and stress  My boyfriend responded by saying “did you just hear what you said ” As if he was shocked by me saying I feel sorry for my Ndad  I also recently had to spend a few days with my Ndad on a trip that he was insisting we take for the last two years  My bf kept asking me why I was being nice to my father  and it was difficult for him to understand when I said that it was just easier this way  It was easier to just be nice to my father in certain moments  even if it made me uncomfortable  I was just in the mindset of trying to get through the trip as quickly and conflict free as possible and I knew that my Ndad would throw a tantrum if things didn’t happen the way he wanted them to happen and them every situation would turn into a whole big thing  I guess I’ve been rambling a bit and over explaining things that we all already know and experience  but this is also me venting a little bit  Ultimately  of course I know that my father is a toxic person and I may benefit from cutting him out completely  but I just feel like right now cutting him out would end up causing me more stress than anything  But I can understand  how my bf would be confused about the situation when I vent to him about my Ndad but then also say that I feel sorry for him with his current house situation  Which honestly confuses me too  but it’s something that been so ingrained into my psyche since I was a kid that I don’t know how to turn it off  And that’s what narcissists specialized in  manipulating their victims to feel whatever way they want them to feel  Despite all this   my boyfriend is still very supportive of me and has helped me a lot  but I guess I was just wondering if others had experienced this same situation with your partners and how you have managed to communicate with them so that they would understand  Anyway  thanks for reading all of this and for any advise you may be able to provide  ❤️,4479,854
1059,p9br0c,0,1,How to get Ndad to stop being angry  So  it all happened two days ago  I was going through a bit of a down mood  and mum happened to see it  she told my Ndad and he was adamant that I go to the room he was in and talk about it I said no  and at first he was like  come on whats the worst that could happen  I was insistent that I didnt want to talk about it because it was a personal issue and he started to get really angry at me Saying he just wanted to get rid of my anxiety I went to my room and Ndad came up  saying that I had left him in a state of worry because he didnt know if I was going to be a threat or not Also going on about how I did it on purpose to wind him up and that I wanted to control the house or something He also said I was trying to wind him up on purpose I told him that I was not going to talk to him about it and hes immediately like  if you are going to be a threat to me and try to control the house you can get out of the house  So then we arranged that I would leave once I found an appropriate accommodation But that wasnt enough  he started saying I had to leave immediately  this instant  because my presence in the house was angering him It was the middle of the night and I had no temporary accommodation at this point He tries to grab me to throw me out of the house and I call the police  which makes him finally leave me alone The next day  he says he wants to talk to me for five minutes  I say yes  hoping to get somewhere but his little conversation is just trying to get me to believe Im an anxious wreck that has a phobia of him and I cant function on my own  so I need him to tell me whats what He goes on this weird rant about scientific facts and evidence and teeth and this anecdote about one of his friends that got all his teeth removed and got dentures instead as some kind of lesson  I have no idea what he was trying to say to be honest I state that conversation is pointless and leave the room  since I know it would have gone on for hours And to be honest  Id rather be shouted at him all day than lectured by him  at least when hes shouting I can actually do things and dont just have to sit and listen to him for  hours And because its frustrating that hes trying to manipulate my thoughts about myself  to get me to beileve his twisted narritive His justification this time is  that Im being rude and disrespectful   But he doesnt invade my personal space a or keep me up all night this time because I start to audio record him and block the entrance to my room whenever he tries He does however  tell me that if I contact the police again  that theyll arrest me for wasting police time I contacted the police after this and they did tell me to indeed call the emergency number if I needed them Its the third day now  no doubt hes gonna keep going at it Frankly this is causing mum and Ndad so much stress  I say that and theyre like  youre causing it  its your responsibility to calm us down  Unfortunately  my mum just goes along with everything my Ndad says  because hes been conditioning her for years with his delusional stories of how the world is out to get them So whenever he gets angry  she gets angry at whatever he is angry at too  because theyre a team I guess They even forced my sister to say nasty things to me  and she did because she was scared not to and now dad is using the evidence that my sister hates me to as further proof that I need sorting out I think Im gonna go out to the park for a majority of the day  I dont care if he smashes up my belongings tbh I frankly dont think theres any way to calm him down and not be in a situation that is triggering to me Because I dont like to have my time wasted But I guess thats the only way to make dad think he has control over me What would you suggest Tldr  Ndad has been angry at me for two days straight because I wont buy into his bs  and its starting to affect my ability to do normal everyday things,4015,774
1060,p9boxb,0,1,Small Victories  Outsmarting a Narcissistic Parent We all know how it can seem almost impossible to beat a narcissistic parent at their own games  Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent  I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom  Feel free to share yours   I wrote about the following in a reply to someone elses post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent I grew up in the s and s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes  Even when I was elementary school aged  I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes  I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking  When I entered my teen years  I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore  She eventually stopped asking However  one day  I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends  My parents had no objection  Later in the day  my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends  I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore  I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing Anyway  her sweet demeanor suddenly changed  and through her clenched jaw  she informed me   Fine  Then you will NOT be using the car this evening   However  her threat didnt sway me  and I told her fine  I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said   Sorry  we cant go to the movie  My mom wont let me use the car because I wont go buy her cigarettes  Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend  her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment  The narcissist in my mom couldnt stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car  Her demeanor once again suddenly changed  and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line  she exclaimed with fake laughter   Oh wait  wait  Hold on  You know I was only kidding  Ha ha ha  So not only did I get to use the car after all  I semi shamed my mom  and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again   I have been living in Japan for about  years  I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family  Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me As you can imagine  it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year  plus spending money while Im there  etc  Despite this  I have never played the  poor card  and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket  My mom  on the other hand  has offered a number of times to either  chip in  or  go half  on the cost of a ticket  A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket  However  I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached  In fact  out of all these offers and in all my time living here  I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight About eight or nine years ago  the last time I ever accepted her offer   she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas  I initially refused and told her it wasnt necessary  However  she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent  She was going on about how she knows its a lot of money to come home twice a year  how she does things to help my sisters  but  because I live in Japan  she and my dad cant help me as much as they would like  etc I finally relented  but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad  which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do  before she went offering to buy an almost   dollar plane ticket for me  She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours When I phoned back  my moms caring and supportive attitude had completely changed  She was now using her half annoyed half righteous tone with me  the one where she elongates the last word in every clause sentence   So I talked to your faaatherrr  and he and I have deciiideeddd    She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden  She told me that she and my dad would  help me out  this time by paying for my ticket  but  its about time you considered moving back to Canada because we cant afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan  I thought to myself   Okay  here we go again   But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered  but if it were too much trouble  it wasnt necessary  and not to worry about   No  No  Thats fiiiine  Well buy your ticket this tiiiime  But you need to think about moving baaack   Of course  I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket  I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my moms attitude and he had no say in  their  decision that I should move back to Canada I got off the phone and though  F    it  Im not going back for Christmas   and I meant it  I waited until the next day  and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story  I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible  I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket  but it really wasnt necessary  It was so nice of him to support my moms offer to pay for my ticket  but I really didnt expect them to buy it  I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer  but it was too generous and I wouldnt be able to accept it  In fact  Ive decided to stay in Japan over the holidays Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad  my phone started ringing  Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return  I had apparently  misunderstood  what she had said  she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket  and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas  All I needed to do was book my ticket  let her know how much it would cost  and she would put the money on my credit card   When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a  bad back   in reality  she couldnt stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work   she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care   after school care because it was a waste of money  Appreciative of my moms offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month  my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer  Big mistake To give my mom credit  she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part  but even that has its limits when shes feeling like holding one of her pity parties  It doesnt help that my niece  since she was a small child and even now at  years old  is prone to outbursts  breakdowns  and temper tantrums  As my niece got a little bit older  my moms over reactions to my nieces over reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over react to the slightest misbehaviour When she was seven years old  my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school  and not to be outdone  my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself  She phoned my sister to work in hysterics  not the first time  literally bawling about my sisters  out of control  disrespectful  hateful  horrible child   you get the picture   And my mom sobbed on and on about how  I just cant take it anymore  Its just too much  Ive had enough  YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter  My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background  who knows where my dad had escaped to   My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone After getting off the phone  my sister realized that saving money on day care   after school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse  So before she went to pick up her kids  my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after school care for my niece and nephew When my sister arrived at my parents  my mom came running to the door in hysterics  her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind  ranting about my sisters ungrateful daughter   You need to do something about YOUR children  my nephew was now apparently caught up in this   WAAAA    As my sister is trying to get her kids coats and boots on  she told my mom to calm down and that  having a temper tantrum over your seven year old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isnt going to solve anything   My mom for the umpteenth time   YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter  I cant take it   WAAAA    At which point my sister told my mom to  grow up  and that she didnt need to  take it anymore  because from the next day  the kids would both be in after school care and walked out the door  At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming   No    No    Why     nieces name     No    Why     as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away My sister didnt go no contact with my mom after that  but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again  my sister refused and kept them in after school care Any stories from any of you about poetic retribution,10082,1897
1061,p9bm8u,0,1,Father playing the victim by saying his daughters are racist towards him So I think I just need to rant for a bit I   f  moved out of my parents house about  years ago and went no contact with them    My father is a very racist person which was always really confusing for me because my parents both immigrated in the country that we are now living in  But he didnt see the irony in it  He says a lot of to put it mildly offensive crap about black and brown people  He especially hates refugees  which is even less understandable since he was a refugee himself   but I guess when they are not white it means for him that they do not deserve to come to this country  My father knew even back when I was living back home that I did not share his  opinions   I rarely spoke up to him in general because he was extremely terrifying to me back then  always screaming and beeing very aggressive  But in that regard I really couldnt take it  The disgusting things he said still haunt me to this day  like for example our chancellor deserves to be r  ped by refugees because she  let  them into this country     So when I finally spoke up to him  he just smiled and said that he wasnt beeing serious   Why would you ever say such a think in general      When I finished school I immediately moved out  I had planned this for a long time since it was an extremely toxic environment in this house and I was in seriosly bad mental state  My mom  my sister   f who moved out when she was   and I never said more than two or three words while my dad just kept rambling his disgusting shit over and over again  He felt entitled to our time  Never asked my sister or me about our interests or even our opinion about anything  Whenever we were talking to each other louder than whispering he would scream what was going on and that he would have to deal with something now  My sister moved out and my mental state started getting worse  I would never go out of my room  I cried a lot and whenever he felt like talking to me I just didnt say anything and waited until his rambling was over  After a year or so  my parents realised that something was wrong with me  My mother tried to talk to me but I was still silent  My father screamed at me that I would hate them and that somebody was influencing me to hate my parents  he thought it was liberal green propaganda   I still wasnt answering  He talked to my sister  who knew how I felt  but when she just denied to answer him  she yelled that she would be at fault if I would kill myself  I knew I need to get out  So that was the first thing I did when I finished school  I have been working for two years back then so I had a little money  So I moved out and immediately got no contact  My father was furious for a while  texting me  calling me and threatening me  He said I was a bad and ungrateful daughter and so on  I just didnt reply  I got therapy  a new appartment and a fantastic boyfriend so I feel fine now  He stopped harrassing me and I am really happy about that  My sister is still in contact with them both but feels very similar towards them  Recently she decided that she needed some boundaries  She talked to my mother and accidently started a shit storm  My mother threatened her with the police  I really dont know what the police could do about this situation  and my father basically kicked her out of the family while saying that she is morally abhorrent  This really effected her badly and she wasnt sure what to do  I only recommended her to ignore it and wait because he will just get over the situation after a while So the last text he send to her was so funny to me and really inspired me to post here  He said that he is sad that the propaganda influenced her that much that she is now hating her immigrant parents  He said that she can never become  one of them  no matter how badly she tries  So basically calling her a racist towards her own parents  I am just buffled by the irony of that  He probably thinks that because racism influences every of his decision that other people are like that too and never in his life thinks about that this has nothing to do with his nationality but with him simply beeing a bad person,4218,810
1062,p9bet0,0,1,My mom is hilarious and I love her dearly  but she’s a compulsive joker  My mom and I are very close  especially because we both survived my emotionally abusive dad  She’s a straight talking lady with a wicked sense of humour  but I swear to God  if there’s a joke to be made she’ll make it Obviously not about EVERYTHING  If I’m distressed or in pain of course that’s different  but with day to day things I genuinely feel like I can’t have a serious conversation with her because I’m waiting for the pun  I actually find it quite disheartening  But of course when I try to tell her that  I either come across like I can’t take a joke or I end up laughing in spite of myself  It’s so frustrating Can anyone relate,719,130

1064,p9b2cp,0,1,Im losing my sister over this I told her how I feel about mom  and that I dont think she really cares about me  or that she doesnt try to work on our relationship  So I told her that I dont really see things working out anymore  Well  shes mad at me now  Cause mom is apparently so sad about me  And that she does try  But that I just dont see it  And that I can do things better as well  In a healthy relationship  I would agree with her  But as my mom is likely a covert narc  its a bit different  Not that I told her this  I thought that would do more damage than good  The heartbreaking thing is  Im now starting to doubt myself again because I dont want to lose her over this  But I guess the damage is already done  I regret ever telling her this now,770,154
1065,p9azxq,0,1,Toxic relationship with parents Hi to yall  Im new on this group  I read some of the discussions started in here and I think it would be helpful for me to explain here my situation  Before I start  Im sure my parents arent the worst here  but their personalities are pretty toxic for someone who has to live with them    Im a  yo   cm tall   gt   and  kilos   lbs   If someone had to hang out with me  he would always see me smile and joke  but the sad reality is that Im deluded and in my life Ive numerous times been thinking of committing suicide  All because of my parents  This thoughts were far more numerous when I was a kid  about  to   before calming down until I was this age  Im not a dominant person  often trying to do my best to help others and disappear when I feel unnecessary and unneeded  This is a result of the jail my parents put me in during these years  where I have to obey their every order  I have always been scared of them and the only thing that kept driving me was the hope of becoming bigger and stronger  in order to defend myself from them  Now to my parents  My mother was born in a military family  As a result  she is very strict  often resulting in her using violence as a method of both punishment and encouragement  I remember when I was a  years old  she broke a rolling pin on my wrist  A new one she had brought the week before  And that wasnt the worst  She has probably always dreamed of a kid she could be proud of  and I have done my best to meet her expectations  I play volleyball in the first squad  where people are usually two times my age  challenging them for the spot in the titulars  I have brilliant result at school  making my school seem like a playground and Im extremely well behaved  Im luckier than some  because my parents compliment me and in my life they showed to care about me  but it isnt a less toxic situation  I always think Im not enough for what I do  If my friends dont message me  if a girl isnt interested in me  if I cant do something at school and in the gym  Im simply not enough  My father is a unempathetic person  He works at home  having almost zero contact with others  This transformed his job of teaching me about life to plasmating me in the best kid ever  Loving me when I do something he likes  hating  no  Im not joking  he often overreacts  reaching physical punishment  when I dont behave like he taught me My father and my mother hate my phone  telling me how much time I waste on it  I myself have grown to hate my waste of time  I use my phone about  hours a day during schooltime  which may seem a great amount of time  but when contextualized its not that great  I try to hang out with my friends in the evening  so I have to chat with them  plus my homework is in the phone  because my teachers use Google Classroom  Im sorry if I bragged too much  but I wanted to write about this in the most concise yet precise way possible  I dont expect advises  but they are more than welcomed  Thank you to all those who read this  Im truly thankful  I want to know I dont deserve to die  That Im not useless,3151,604

1069,p99z6p,0,1,I F am recalling all these fucked up things my mom  F  used to do    LONG VENT   I’m moved out now  and her and I do not talk or see each other at all as I am being shunned for religious reasons   you can read my story on my page for more on that   but lately I’ve been having such a hard time sleeping at night because I’m so torn with feeling like shit about myself  and wondering what is wrong with me  and why am I so hard to love  yet it seems to come instantaneously with my other four siblings  gonna list some things off the top of my head  before I do  here’s some background so the list can make sense  I am the second oldest of my five siblings  there are  different dads so we are pretty blended  order from oldest to youngest goes like this  changing names for sake of privacy  Aidan  M  half brother  has own dad  Me  F  same dad as brother below  Wesley  M  only full blooded brother  Ezra  M  half brother  has same dad as sister below Fiona  F  half sister  Things off the top of my head    when I was in kindergarten to first grade  I remember my mom constantly pretended to drop me off and leave me at graveyards and cemeteries in the winter when I had an attitude or made her upset  I remember crying and holding onto the door handles of the car pleading as my mom allowed Aidan to open the door  pull me out  and then jump back in and zoom off as I tried to scramble to my feet  boogery nosed and terrified  running after the car  as my older brother laughed while sticking his head out the window while I continued to run to which she’d of course speed up and disappear over the horizon  I’d just fall to the ground on the sandy dirt road  as the frost bit my face and cry for what felt like an eternity before she’d come back    Urinated on my bare mattress  soaked it to the point I had to throw it away and sleep on the floor for weeks because of an argument    when I was around   she gave me a black eye while she was driving and I was in the passenger  shortly after  while in a bad neighborhood  she leans over  still driving  and opens my door  unbuckles my seatbelt  and screams at me to get out of the car  Again  I was pleading with her even as she began pushing me with her free hand that wasn’t on the wheel  I fell out and rolled onto the side of the street  Cars behind us witnessed it all   Because we were on our way to pick up Ezra and Wesley from school  she said not to worry about changing my clothes since we weren’t getting out of the car  so all I was wearing was shorts  a tank top with no bra  one sock  and no shoes   I wandered that bad neighborhood crying and desperately trying to call anyone to pick me up before she of course  came and found me  and began apologizing like crazy    took my lock away for talking past hours on the phone to my biological dad  this resulted in many embarrassing no knock walk ins where I’d be partially or entirely naked  and then my stepdad or brothers would embarrassingly close the door    when Aidan made the choice to be homeless because he didn’t want to follow the no drugs in the house rule  my mom frequently woke me up in the middle of the night and crawled into my bed while I was nearly  and would sob heavily over her nightmares about something bad happening to my older brother  I would comfort her as she laid on me    Made it a point to humiliate me in front of guys I was dating by saying “I hope looks are all that matter to you because she can’t cook a hot meal or do a load of laundry if her life depended on it  I remember when she used to go weeks without showering or brushing her teeth ”  I am now moved out and am a great cook  and can do laundry just fine  with a house of  people  the washer and dryer was always packed so I couldn’t find time to wash my clothes between work and school  and the exaggerated poor hygiene was a result of Aidan taking his infamous   hour long showers multiple times a day  and not letting anyone in to get anything  when the bathroom was free  I took care of myself     pinning me down against my bed and threatening me  repeating “you wanna fucking box  You wanna go  I’ll break you in half easily because I think you forget I’m twice your size and can easily beat the shit out of you ” just spit droplets hitting my face while I hold back tears and bite my tongue before she gets up and walks out of my room saying “That’s what I thought ”  her putting her hands on me and threatening to beat me was a constant thing  I never dared to lay a hand on her because I knew she was right  I’ve never put hands on my mother   this all happened because she was disappointed I was doing bad in school  I was  at the time  this would be the same argument that pushed me to book a greyhound ticket to a whole different state to stay with my biological dad who I hadn’t seen in over  years because I needed space from her    when I was going through puberty  I couldn’t get comfortable with pads because even the maxi pads would bleed through my heavy flow  and tampons scared me and were painful every time I tried  so I began stuffing large amounts of toilet paper in my underwear because I found this was the only thing that stopped the mess  when we were going into church one day  I guess my mom told my stepdad because she found out a few days prior by questioning why the toilet paper kept running out so fast  And my stepdad upon observation and seeing the toilet paper outline through my dress  began calling me “donkey balls”  Aidan and Wesley and even my mom had the time of their lives laughing  I was anemic    starting at  when my parents decided to get a divorce  she began leaning on me very heavy and would come into my room at night after we moved into apartments and left our childhood house  she would express how she just wants to take her car and drive off a cliff or blow her brains out and just die  and that there is nothing in life that brings her happiness   Even though she had  whole kids at the time   Being so young I was would just cry and beg her not to  and then she’d just get up and go to sleep  I wouldn’t be able to sleep the rest of the night  terrified that I’d wake up and not have a mom anymore    calling the police on me for “domestic disturbance” when i tried to come visit Wesley after I was disassociated from the religion and was being shunned  She told me that she has not been keeping any of my siblings from reaching out to me  that they haven’t reached out to me because “they don’t want a relationship with you ” I ubered there  and when she came back outside after giving me permission to speak to Wesley privately  and began calling the police  I just once again  humiliated  left on foot crying walking down the street  I had no weapons and did not try to enter into the home   I had not even been moved out for a year yet     constantly asking people right in front of me “don’t you think she would look far more beautiful if she had long straight hair ” right after I chopped my curly hair into a short off the shoulder fro  pressuring me to flat iron it before special occasions  job interviews  meeting a boy she liked for me for the first time  etc  I would get so angry because it was so often she’d make such a huge deal    not checking in on how I was doing emotionally when my older brother attempted to overdose in front of me and the two youngest  he just went to the kitchen cabinet and began opening every prescription bottle of pills and downing them all as I tried to stop him  he ends up leaving the house  as I’m pulling on him begging and trying to get him to stay  but he’s too strong and he leaves out the front door  since I’m watching Ezra and Fiona while my parents are working  I couldn’t leave to chase him and didn’t have a car yet  so I had to call the police who phoned the ambulance even though I told them he isn’t at home over the phone   ambulances and  police cars later  parents rushed home after the police have already searched our house  they find him by a convenient store  mom is crying as she listens to the ordeal on the police radio because he’s trying to run and refuse detainment  they catch him  and he is baker acted in the hospital  he didn’t want to see me in there  and still resents me to this day from stopping him  that was traumatic as hell for me  as I was made to feel like it was my fault  and nobody came to see how I was doing  but all  of my other siblings are asked by my mom and stepdad if they’re okay and are all talked to separately  allowing my stepdad to put me in a headlock in front of my three younger siblings  I was by the front door wanting to go for a drive to cool off after a heated discussion because I was  and should be able to do that  but because it was close to pm  my stepdad chases me to the door and puts me in the headlock to the point I’m struggling to breathe and crying to let me go and that I can’t breathe  and my mom is standing there saying “yeah just go  just go and abandon your siblings just like Aidan ” and then she turns my attention to the corner of the hallway where all of my siblings are peering  there staring at me  I hate that day so much  It makes me choke up with anger  I am very sensitive about hands around my neck to this day  even if it’s in a playful manner because of this incident and ones like it   a year later from this incident  while my stepdad is at work  my mom creates yet another argument out of thin fucking air while I’m in my room  just about how I’m not doing the things I’m supposed to be  and that she’s disappointed I’m not where I should be at in life  she kicks me out again in front of my siblings  and I drive off to a grocery store parking lot and just cry alone in my car  I end up coming back a few hours later and she once again  apologizes and says she didn’t mean it    always making me feel like I couldn’t come to her for help when I needed it  I remember being  or so and my car ran out of gas to get to work  luckily I was able to pull into a gas station before it gave out on me  but I just remember checking my bank account and crying to myself in my car because I didn’t know who I could ask    Had knowledge that I was struggling financially in my arranged marriage   which I am free from now   knew that I was being raped  physically abused  and verbally abused  knew that I didn’t have toilet paper to wipe my ass  paper towels  dish soap  laundry detergent  gas money  food  that I had received multiple eviction notices  knew that I needed HELP  but instead told one of my friends who relayed it back to me that “I hope she knows if she gets evicted  she’s not welcome back here  She got herself into this mess  she can get herself out of it  then expressed her intense disappointment in me for getting a divorce and leaving the religion and betraying the family   Yet when Aidan was “homeless ” she spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars buying him new phones  booking him the most luxury bus tickets to get to whatever state he was needing to get to  sending him money for food  for clothes  just anything   in case you couldn’t tell  Aidan has first born favorite privileges with mom  this list could go on forever  my family has put me through so much shit  and I have done nothing but try my best to stay out of the way and not create more problems  I paid for things myself  I helped pick up Wesley  Ezra  and Fiona most days from school when I started driving  I gave up a social life to babysit constantly  I’ve spoiled my the youngest two and continued to care for them even after moving out  took them on trips  did arts and crafts with them  built forts  took them dolphin watching at the pier on the weekends  to the fair  movies  sleepovers at my apartment  stayed up til daylight playing video games  I just feel like so used and thrown away  Like the giving tree at the end  just a stump  accept nobody comes and appreciates me despite just being a stump  I feel all used up and without any value anymore  I feel like back then no one ever saw me  or made a big deal about my accomplishments or even told me they loved me  my mom was trimming my hair one time  and she moved the curtain of hair from my face to pause and say  “I love you ” It was so out of nowhere and I hadn’t heard her say that in so long  that as soon as she moved the hair back to continue trimming  a lump instantly formed in my throat and tears rolled down my face  Our relationship is so strange and I hate how much I adored her and how hard it is to not miss her because I can hardly think of a day she didn’t find a way to make me feel like absolute shit  The toy story  scene where Jessie has a flashback of when she used to be loved by her kid  that song “when she loved me”  really messes with me  I just want to be able to move on  It feels so pathetic even writing this  I wanna not cry anymore  I want to forget  I just have so much anxiety and fear of abandonment and fear that I’m gonna be a failure of a mother to my first child that I’m currently pregnant with  Confusion  I ask myself daily  “when is it that I became trash ” I just feel so alone  I HATE THIS,13195,2568
1070,p99v0w,0,1,Does your parents ask money monthly  So here I am  my parent started asking me money on monthly basis aggressively  They say I owe them because they are my parents  basically they are saying that I should start repaying them because they raised me  Fuck that  me and my siblings were not even allowed to play growing up  It is a nightmare  we have to save money to buy our own stuff like literally  I finish school by scholarship and yet they dont credit me enough for that   Now I completely blocked so they cant contacr me anymore,533,99
1071,p99swv,0,1,Loss of autonomy and built in fear So I moved out of my parent’s house in  at age  after I stuck up for myself against my nmom for the first time  Her reaction was that she was going to as she said “knock me to the ground in such a way that I wouldn’t want to get up” they were always very verbally abusive and such but never physical  I was adopted as a young teen and I often wondered growing up if they regretted it everyday and that’s why they acted like they hated me so much  They would make me clean the whole house and wouldn’t offer any help but if I missed the smallest thing I would be degraded and it was the end of the world  I was worthless to them for making the smallest mistakes  When I finally left I went to a friend’s house and saw the way they were living and it was upsetting for me because I would put so much effort and emphasis on cleaning everything before bed and everything I did had to be perfect  I started having a panic attack over the dishes not being done and when I calmed down I was told that it was fine if they weren’t done cause it was late and could be done later  They asked me why I cared so much about dirty dishes and I literally responded with “cause we’ll be in trouble if it’s not done before your parents go to sleep ” And at that point I realized that the way I was raised was by tyrants to the point that I didn’t know what to do without someone telling me what I was allowed to do  It is very upsetting though that when I go to their house now my mom never does the dishes and when my sister doesn’t do them no one ever says anything,1591,321
1072,p99lg3,0,1,Small victories  Outsmarting a narcissistic parent We all know how it can seem almost impossible to beat a narcissistic parent at their own games   Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent   I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom   Feel free to share yours   I wrote about the following in a reply to someone elses post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent I grew up in the s and s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes  Even when I was elementary school aged  I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes  I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking   When I entered my teen years  I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore   She eventually stopped asking However  one day  I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends  My parents had no objection  Later in the day  my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends  I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore  I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing Anyway  her sweet demeanor suddenly changed  and through her clenched jaw  she informed me   Fine  Then you will NOT be using the car this evening   However  her threat didnt sway me  and I told her fine  I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said   Sorry  we cant go to the movie  My mom wont let me use the car because I wont go buy her cigarettes  Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend  her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment  The narcissist in my mom couldnt stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car  Her demeanor once again suddenly changed  and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line  she exclaimed with fake laughter   Oh wait  wait  Hold on  You know I was only kidding  Ha ha ha  So not only did I get to use the car after all  I semi shamed my mom  and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again   I have been living in Japan for about  years   I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family   Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me   As you can imagine  it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year  plus spending money while Im there  etc   Despite this  I have never played the  poor card  and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket   My mom  on the other hand  has offered a number of times to either  chip in  or  go half  on the cost of a ticket   A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket   However  I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached   In fact  out of all these offers and in all my time living here  I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight About eight or nine years ago  the last time I ever accepted her offer   she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas   I initially refused and told her it wasnt necessary  However  she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent   She was going on about how she knows its a lot of money to come home twice a year  how she does things to help my sisters  but  because I live in Japan  she and my dad cant help me as much as they would like  etc I finally relented  but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad  which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do  before she went offering to buy an almost   dollar plane ticket for me   She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours When I phoned back  my moms caring and supportive attitude had completely changed   She was now using her half annoyed half righteous tone with me  the one where she elongates the last word in every clause sentence    So I talked to your faaatherrr  and he and I have deciiideeddd    She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden   She told me that she and my dad would  help me out  this time by paying for my ticket  but  its about time you considered moving back to Canada because we cant afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan  I thought to myself   Okay  here we go again    But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered  but if it were too much trouble  it wasnt necessary  and not to worry about    No  No   Thats fiiiine   Well buy your ticket this tiiiime   But you need to think about moving baaack    Of course  I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket   I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my moms attitude and he had no say in  their  decision that I should move back to Canada I got off the phone and though  F    it   Im not going back for Christmas   and I meant it   I waited until the next day  and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story  I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible   I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket  but it really wasnt necessary   It was so nice of him to support my moms offer to pay for my ticket  but I really didnt expect them to buy it   I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer  but it was too generous and I wouldnt be able to accept it   In fact  Ive decided to stay in Japan over the holidays Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad  my phone started ringing   Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return   I had apparently  misunderstood  what she had said  she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket  and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas   All I needed to do was book my ticket  let her know how much it would cost  and she would put the money on my credit card   When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a  bad back   in reality  she couldnt stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work   she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care   after school care because it was a waste of money   Appreciative of my moms offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month  my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer   Big mistake To give my mom credit  she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part  but even that has its limits when shes feeling like holding one of her pity parties   It doesnt help that my niece  since she was a small child and even now at  years old  is prone to outbursts  breakdowns  and temper tantrums   As my niece got a little bit older  my moms over reactions to my nieces over reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over react to the slightest misbehaviour When she was seven years old  my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school  and not to be outdone  my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself   She phoned my sister to work in hysterics  not the first time  literally bawling about my sisters  out of control  disrespectful  hateful  horrible child   you get the picture    And my mom sobbed on and on about how  I just cant take it anymore   Its just too much   Ive had enough  YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter    My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background  who knows where my dad had escaped to   My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone After getting off the phone  my sister realized that saving money on day care   after school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse   So before she went to pick up her kids  my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after school care for my niece and nephew When my sister arrived at my parents  my mom came running to the door in hysterics  her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind  ranting about my sisters ungrateful daughter    You need to do something about YOUR children  my nephew was now apparently caught up in this   WAAAA      As my sister is trying to get her kids coats and boots on  she told my mom to calm down and that  having a temper tantrum over your seven year old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isnt going to solve anything    My mom for the umpteenth time   YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter   I cant take it   WAAAA     At which point my sister told my mom to  grow up  and that she didnt need to  take it anymore  because from the next day  the kids would both be in after school care and walked out the door   At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming   No    No    Why     nieces name     No    Why     as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away My sister didnt go no contact with my mom after that  but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again  my sister refused and kept them in after school care Any stories from any of you about poetic retribution,10136,1951
1073,p99fwe,0,1,My mom is fuming because she found out I am not gonna get my horrible sister anything for her birthday I have another post that goes into more detail  but basically  two weeks before my th birthday I got some money the government still owed me  My mom expected me to get my sister an expensive present for her  because my sister  who earns a lot more money than me  always buys presents for me for my birthday while I often make things for her by hand  crochet   Where my mom got the idea that my sister was somehow  owed  any of MY money  idk  I bought something nice for myself after months of saving up for it  That was enough for my sister to not get me anything for my birthday  which was  weeks later  and also just leave the house later in the day to go sleep at her boyfriends house or something  I later found out my mom was actually the one who encouraged her to get me nothing  My birthday was fucking ruined  When I arrived at school the next day  a Monday  my classmates threw a better birthday for me than my family had  which was just kinda sad as we literally celebrated my birthday during a Geography class  weeks ago  my sister mocked the fact that I was raped by my ex boyfriend at the dinner table  She said  I get why he raped you  Actually  I dont  you are ugly and nobody would want to rape you anyway  Needless to say  that comment absolutely crushed me  I have been in specialized TF CBT and EMDR therapy for the fact that I was raped  and was diagnosed with PTSD when I was   mostly because of the event  It has ruined my life  and I still suffer from the after effects every day of my life  I have tried to avoid my sister  but my mom asked me today what I was gonna get her for her th birthday  which is in  days  I said  nothing  My mom absolutely exploded on me  She said she could not understand how I was so selfish  I asked her if she could not see why  and told her because of that comment  She said I was holding  old events  over her head  that I was lazy and selfish  and that I will ruin her birthday My mom apparently thinks that  not getting my sister an expensive gift for no reason from the money I was owed  within  weeks after getting it  was a sin great enough to skip my birthday and ruin it over  but my sister mocking the most severely traumatic event that has ever happened to me is not   amp  xB I am planning on staying with my partner for a few days until my sisters birthday is over  I am scared of my sister  My therapist has been ghosting me since Juli  I cannot reach her anywhere  Therapy sessions have abruptly stopped  I have nobody to talk to about this  I feel so alone,2665,505

1078,p98wdo,0,1,Thinking about cutting off contact with Nmom I’ll try to be as brief as possible My parents separated when I was very young and my mom eventually won full custody and moved me out of state away from my father  stepmom  and my new brother and sister  Nmom said awful  untrue  things about my father to me growing up and threatened to commit suicide in front of me two times when I was   or so  She claims that never happened  After being married for  years and having a child  I am now divorced and have spent the last   with an amazing woman   we have two more kids of our own and a house but aren’t married  We were traveling this summer and invited my mom to stay with us for a week and visit the grandkids  She was so insulted that we had told her that her visit would be capped at  nights that she texted the night before that she wasn’t coming  The next morning I awoke to her texting me that she was on the plane  After an awkward five days together  my mom finally decided to unload on me that she thinks my partner is “bossy” and that the one week visit limit was her idea and I was weak for going along with it  The three of us had a sit down and my partner told my mother that she didn’t have to like her but she had to respect her  My mother showed so much respect to her she left on the next flight out of town two hours later  a day earlier than planned  without even saying goodbye   That was six weeks ago and we haven’t spoken since  Last week mother called my  year old and told her that she didn’t know why I was mad at her but I am acting childish and haven’t called her in months  She did however text me to say that she would be cutting me off financially from her  removing me as beneficiary of her accounts  and even stopping the   she puts monthly into my childrens college funds  I have been successful enough on my own to not need her money  but we do live in a house that she helped us buy a few years ago so she is on the deed and mortgage with us  She has shown so little regard for my partner  the boundaries we wished to uphold  and my own happiness that I am considering never speaking to her again  I just found this forum and any advice for how to deal with her is appreciated,2232,441

1080,p98rep,0,1,Growing apathy  I consider myself to be a very empathetic person  So much that I base my entire life on it  To me it is such a powerful word and is one of the most important things in my life to me  But my Nparent has made me grown a sense of apathy  And I absolutely hate that I am becoming the complete opposite of what I want to be  But any child of a narcissist would know that growing apathy is a way to survive  Because if you get too invested you will just get more and more hurt  And I have no idea how to balance it anymore  I try to practice empathy everything I do but in the back of my mind and in my heart I have grown so much apathy but I feel like I’m losing such a big part of myself  Then it doesn’t help that I already struggle with other mental illnesses  I’ve grown to feel nothing  Just another effect of having a Nparent I never thought about,865,175

1089,p981fc,0,1,Yet another “you’ll take care of me in my old age right ”  I’m literally camping out in the bathroom as I type this bc she snipes whenever she sees my phone and my desk with computer is right beside hers  It happens now and then  In any discussion topic where old people are brought up  my asian mother will always find a way to sweetly say “See  you have to be kind and good to your mom  You’re the only child so you’ll have to take of me when I’m older  You’ll let me live with you so you can take care of me right  ” I feel like such a piece of shit every time this happens  I have to say “yes” because any other reply is unthinkable  but she always detects my insincerity and gets unhappy and I can’t convincingly pretend I care for her I just can’t do it  Also in asian cultures  having older generations live with the younger is standard because it’s expected for children to take care of their parents  It makes me want to die every time I think about it  My dream is to move halfway across the world and never see my parents again  but as the only child I can’t do that  My mother can’t control her anger  is childish at times and is an emotionally manipulative narc  but she and my dad have worked really hard to fund my schooling extracurriculars and going NC would be a poor way to repay their effort  Yet I’m depressed and probably have some sort of PTSD from surviving at home  I have a lot of emotional issues from surviving her and having no good example to learn from  I don’t know what I’m going to do  As a short term plan I’m banking on getting into a university that’s across the country so I’ll have some semblance of freedom even if they’re paying for it  But even if I get in I don’t know what I’ll do after  I will not move back to my home city  I cannot bear to do so  My parents will expect me to repay their efforts  The only thing I can think of would be to somehow get a job that makes enough money to pay for a senior care home and I’ll send them money from wherever I live   though the issue with that is I’ll have to pay the brunt of it bc we’re a low middle income family  And I’ll have to pay for  them living in an expensive city while also sustaining myself  I despair every time thinking about what to do  If I can manage to become financially independant there’s technically nothing stopping me from going NC but I have no idea how to completely go independent  There’s always bound to be some kind of form or document or bank statement that my parents have to agree to sign that my mom will never do to ensure I can’t leave her  Esp  because they have saved up some money for me and since I’m going into science med it’ll be a long time before I can get a stable job and be unreliant on their money funding my education  And it’s worse that I don’t even live in a terrible household  We always have food  I have endless access to extracurriculars and education  and my parents work long hours to ensure I don’t feel like money is an issue Despair is really the only word to describe what I feel  I don’t know what to do and I constantly feel like I’m stuck forever,3118,599

1094,p97uk6,0,1,Ive started to realize what my mom is   So recently  I started to realize how narcissistic my mother is  Ive compared the difference between my mom and dad and how they treat me  My dad always gives my siblings and I  overwhelming love and he tries to help as much as he can and give us space and tips support us despite my parents being divorced  My mom on the other hand  as much as she says she helps me and does things for me  holds those things over my head throws them back in my face and uses them to guilt trip me into feeling bad and doing what she wants me to do Im  now  soon to be   I have to share a car with mom cause I have yet to get help with getting one for myself since she wants to pick it for me  Other than that  the only thing she does for me is let me love at the house rent free and do my laundry  I pay for my own groceries  I pay my phone bill  Buy my own clothes shoes jewelry  etc  I sometimes buy my own dinner when Im out cause in her words  you have all that money saved up  go get yourself dinner   She  quite often  tells me what she thinks I should spend my money on and its frustrating when I say I dont want to cause she always tells me I have more money than her  I can afford it  I should spend that money I worked so hard to build up and save st realization  we were on vacation at my grandmothers house and I assumed we would be leaving by a certain time cause thats what I was told  We would be driving   hours to get back home and I wanted to have ample time to sleep before I had to go to work the day after the next  Well  when I found out we were leaving much later  I was worried and upset we wouldnt get home in time for me to get enough sleep for work or thatd I have to call off an extra day last minute  When I expressed I was upset about that  my mother proceeded to tell me I dont get to act shitty feel shitty about the situation because my grandmother wanted to prepare a meal for us before we left which  im fine with cause I love her cooking  I just didnt enjoy the fact that I was told last minute and now I had to worry about time and work a little extra now  She yelled at me and told me Im acting shitty and it wasnt a set time anyways and I need to get off my attitude  I got even more upset and ran inside after getting loud along with her  I told my grandmother everything and she agreed my mother wasnt the best and if I ever need to talk or vent  I could call her and she could help me as best as she could nd experience  Tom Thumb was having a buy  ice creams for   deal and I had to partake  I was gonna buy it for myself but when I got to the check out with my mom in tow  she offered to help me and buy it for me  I accepted and once the week had passed  I finished one off and planned to eat the other one the Monday of the next week coming up so Id have something to look forward to when I got home from work  My stepdad ate all of it in one night and I told him it was mine  He said hed pay for it  A week goes by and he never bought it  I brought it up and he was pissed about it  My mom butt in and told him that actually  she had bought the ice cream and my stepfather didnt need to pay for it  therefore  it was not mine and they arent gonna buy me a new one since they already paid for a new one  I was upset because  yes  they did technically buy it but it was mine  regardless of who bought it  I was upset to hell and back so I was gonna run to my room but my mom quipped back with a snide comment   yeah  Run up to your room and figure out why youre upset   I wasnt sure what to even say or do so I curled up in my brothers truck  the trunk  and called my grandmother for awhile till it was dark out  This lead to a night where I was leaving for a friends house with ice cream I BOUGHT this time  I jokingly said  how about I take one your ice creams   stepdads name    He proceeded to say  yeah  Sure  But Im taking yours if you do   So I replied You already took one of mine  You cant just take another one  Thats not fair  And he started getting pissed off cause I brought up the ice cream issue again He told me  along with my mom   I pay for this house and the roof over your head  As a matter of fact  hardly anything in this house is yours at all  I brought up every Christmas  every clothing item  every piece of technology  poster  every snack  pair of shoes  purses  books  etc that I bought in this house and that were gifted to me by a family member that wasnt them  I had even bought the dog blankets and one of our dogs beds  Ive paid for their haircuts and nails to get done before too  He responded with same line  very little in this house is yours   Which aggravated me  I dont remember exactly what I said but I replied mocking towards him and my mother and insulted them in some  not by calling them names but in a way that hurt their pride  Ive never called them names in an argument ever  I rushed out of the front door to my friends car with the snacks and my overnight bag and just told her to drive  That apparently really upset my stepdad for once Which I wasnt aware of and from my mothers words  we were just messing around and joking with you  Youre the one who took it too far   She says that and yet she belittled me and made a snide comment and made me buy myself  new things of ice cream  She saw that I had done that and commented that she was gonna buy them for me  She only said that because she saw I bought them  She wasnt going to buy them for me  She forgets everything regarding me unless I remind her or do it my fucking self which I usually end up doing  She guilt tripped into feeling bad for spending my money on a treat I wanted for myself so I can have a reward to look forward to when I get home  rd experience  we were on my way back from work and I finally broke down after stress cause I mentioned the ice cream incident and the reason I wasnt going to ask my stepdad for anything anymore since earlier that morning he said  oh youre finally asking for shit now   Like I dont previously ask for things already  I have to put my name on the things I buy because I cant trust someone not to eat it  No one will buy it for me later if they eat it bc they always have to bring up the fact that they pay the bills and keep the roof over my head My mom blamed me for the entire ice cream incident all because I took everything too far when  in reality  im tired of just glossing over things with her and letting her get away with saying mean shit to me bc she wants to hold power over me in some way  My grandmother helped and told me I need to stand my ground with her  Talk things out and let her know when shes saying something thats bullshit I broke down and yelled at her about it  about how she does this shit all the time  She buys things for us to be nice then throws them back in our face by saying  So I can just take back that Nike jacket right  And all those Christmas gifts  Since you wanna be shitty to me  right   She threatens to take stuff back or remove them or whatever  She denied it  She denied everything brought up because my voice cracking  my emotions were out of control and I was having a mental breakdown in the car sobbing uncontrollably  I brought everything she did that wronged me or fucked up my life in some way  shes not physically abusive   just verbally or mentally manipulative and so on   She denied everything  Turned the conversation around on me and blamed me and said I had been acting ungrateful towards her and making her feel like shit for the past  weeks as if she didnt make me feel like shit for years   weeks is nothing  I realized when I was in therapy  she was the reason for me getting into therapy  She was the soul problem in my life  Unfortunately I had to cancel future appointments due to quitting my awful job and the price going up She tried to say  If you want me to fix things or work on things  you need to work with me  You need to communicate with me  Tell me whats wrong  I told her I didnt want to  I was tired of trying At one point she said  Im the parent    Regardless of the situation  I deserve respect   I replied Thats an excuse  Youre using this as an excuse to be a horrible person  After I said I didnt want to work out things with her She threatened blackmailed me  Well if you wanna use this car to get yourself to work instead of using uber  youre gonna have to communicate with me  I pointed out she was blackmailing threatening me as soon as she finished and she denied it  No Im not  Thats not what I said at all  As soon as we got home  I ran inside  threw my things on a table and ran out of the house all the way to my friends house  hiccuping  sobbing and red faced  I didnt come home for  days  I told her over text that I wanted to talk like adults not  parent and child  and I wanted to be respected  I wanted to be able to finish my sentences without being cut off or talked over  I wanted an apology and I wanted her to think about her actions and words as well like she always raised me to do when Ive hurt my friends or upset them The reason I had brought that up was because my grandmother had told me to tell her where I was  I did cause my grandmother hasnt wronged me  My mom replied with  thank you ❤   which pissed me off cause she always does this after we get into a fight  She tries to act innocent and sweet to patch things up and make me wanna apologize like its nothing or tell her I love her or whatever to make her feel better about the whole situation I sent her the paragraph that I wanted to talk as I stated above   and she just said  Im sorry you feel upset  But we can talk as long as you dont bring up the past  I replied firmly   no  Im allowed to bring up the past because you still treat me the same way as in the past  Nothing has changed  And dont apologize for my emotions  Apologize for your actions  Thats what a proper apology is  Thats what you taught me  Think about that and we can talk tomorrow  We didnt end up talking because I stayed at my friends house later than expected bc I was getting anxious about going home  When I finally went home  things went as if nothing had happened  th  most recent experience  tonight I was forced to clean up after dinner even though I helped cook  My mom said  you didnt clean the last two nights  You brother cleaned the entire kitchen the night before and last night your sister did it by herself  Its your turn to clean  The night before  I had gotten home after being yelled at by my supervisor all day and I had a pinched nerve in my back from being bent over all day cleaning  part of my job to clean all day   I was too tired to clean up and in too much pain Last night  my mom bought fast food for everyone but me because I said Id eat out  The only thing my sister had to clean up was her own damn food  She didnt clean up the whole kitchen  She just threw her food away and that was it  I didnt bring that up because I was getting pissed off Usually I have to call my sister or brother to help me clean up the kitchen so its not just me but my mom always gives them a pass not to help out  It frustrates me because just as much as my brother has a job and my sister has school  I also have a job too  Its just as tiring and Im getting yelled at or forced to rush my work all day in the heat as well I couldnt be more pissed off with her so finished the kitchen  clearly making a racket with how pissed I was and she yelled at me to stop acting pissed off about the situation then I went upstairs  She came in later and said the same line she always says if we get into a fight before we all settle down for bed Goodnight  I still love you though  Followed by either Even if you dont love me back   Even if you dont think I do  And sometimes shell try to hug me and Ill push her off and deny her which only makes her more upset because she so desperately wants me to apologize and pretend nothing happened and to forgive her as if she didnt say the meanest shit to me about me She does this constantly and always the same way  Ive memorized it at this point and I always expect it when I hear her coming up the stairs  I even know what her footsteps sound like  Other experiences  shell invite me out with her to places where she plans to buy things and she wont tell me Im paying for myself till Im checking things out  She does it all the time when we go to get our nails done  She doesnt tell me till we get there that Im paying for myself but when I deny that I dont wanna pay for something I can do at home shell say  all that money you have  You can afford it  But be stingy   She sometimes even tells me I should buy certain things or tells me I should get things that I wasnt even looking to invest in or buy for myself  She always brings up how I have the money for it but Im saving as much of money for my future car and the future college and apartment when I move out cause Im sick of living here and being treated like this  Spent a couple of my high school summers watching my sister and I was never allowed to even step foot outside  Not for the mail  Not to sit in the backyard  Not to sit on the front porch front steps  Not to even walk the dog  I was slowly getting more and more depressed  I was mentally spacing out more and more where I felt like I wasnt even mentally clocked in whenever I was awake during those couple months  It felt like I was in autopilot  I wasnt even allowed to sleep in bc anything could happen to my sister while Im sleeping  When all she did was sit on her phone or watch YouTube  She would always tell me Im not allowed to be upset about it bc at least she paid me for it and my sister is my responsibility  when I had a brother who could watch her just fine too   She said she should be making me watch her for free since Im sister and this is what Im supposed to do but  shes being nice and paying me   Sometimes shed pay me by getting me a bag of chips I wanted  Id sometimes ask her if she could get me a small bag of chips and shed say that was my allowance for the week and if I really wanted it then she could do that but she wouldnt pay   Which was fucking ridiculous because a small   bag of chips doesnt have the same value as   for watching and working like a babysitter  I told her about this too and she denied it  Said my sister called her crying bc she didnt know where I had gone when Id tell her Im walking the dog or just sit on the porch right by the front door  Shed still cry and scream even when I did leave the house and call my mom crying and screaming about it  Then my mom would come home later and yell at me about it or call me and yell at me Before I realized I cant actually talk to her about my problems  I tried to tell her about them and she always told me Im not allowed to be upset or feel a certain negative emotion  act shitty  because whatever Im upset about is my responsibility and I should just figure out how to deal with it or stop crying because its such a small thing to be upset over And I swear she judges me on what I wear and the jobs I get and how I need to power through shitty jobs for the money  I dont like working for people who dont give me enough hours or treat me like shit yell at me on a constant basis when Im giving my all and doing my best as it is  Another thing  I try to show my gratitude to her for letting me use her car so much and  keeping a roof over my head and letting me live rent free at home   By paying for the dogs important things like food  nail trims  haircuts  treats  shots  etc  Getting gas as often as I can  Occasionally going out of my way to get her a coffee food just to be nice and helping her out cooking for her or walking the dogs helping out with my sister and so on but she likes to call me ungrateful all the time  I even try to tell her verbally that I appreciate what she  does  for me etc  Still told Im ungrateful She also likes to talk over me alot or cut me off when I try to stand my ground or genuinely speak to her over something she said Im sorry this was so long but I dont have anywhere else to get this out at and I saw this thread and kinda just   immediately went to venting  I mean  I accept advice if anyone has any but I kinda already have a plan to speak to her about these matters  Im just   putting this out there for the ears willing to listen,16509,3257

1096,p97n16,0,1,Im drowning  Please help  Its been a long time  I used to come here four years ago when I went through an estrangement with my parents  I went from one emotionally abusive relationship into the next  I got engaged after   years of dating and my relationship got so much worse  I left him after  years  once I was close enough to graduating and had the financial means to do so  I went to DBT therapy for help because he and my BPD sister and my abusive parents made me think I had BPD   Heads up  I went to  weeks of therapy with DBT to be told I definitely dont have a personality disorder by specialists who specialize in personality disorders   I am so fiercely depressed but it hits me in big crashes  I am okay for a while and then I get smashed down  Now that we broke up my ex admits  kind of  that he manipulated me to get what he wanted  then sometimes he says he never did that   He hints that I was naive about men and about people  He always told me that people only mean me harm  Sad thing  I used to believe in people  I used to think he was flawed for not trusting anyone and being so standoffish to the point where he was abusive and couldnt open up  After how he treated me though  I dont trust anymore  I think hes kind of right  People just want to use you for what they can most of the time  I dont want anyone because I am so scared Ill be mistreated again  I have trouble talking about this without making light of it but he pressured me into sex often  He was mean to me and started to treat me differently when I didnt want it  Even though I love him and see the good parts of him  I really struggle to say this but he raped me  When I say that I feel like Im betraying him  He knew I didnt want to  I said I was tired  I said I didnt want to  But he did it anyway  hoping I would get into it   And later when I asked him why he said  I guess I just wanted what I wanted  And sometimes alpha mentality makes you take what you want   And now we stay friends because I dont even know why I cant leave the relationship fully  And while he has been good to me so far as a friend  kinda    I feel he still manipulates me  I feel embarrassed that I continue to be around him and I feel I still cant bring myself to tell him I dont want him around because honestly  I do want him around  Why  Why do I still want him around  Why  I apologized to my parents  I felt badly for them because of the lives that made them into narcs  and now we have VLC because I learned DBT skills to cope and because I feel guilty and bad for them because they didnt have easy lives  I believe people are very complex and I see all of the forces acting on them to make them into themselves and I dont know whether they can be held accountable or not and I struggle  And I try so hard to be decent  I try so hard not to step on toes or hurt anyone  I am just so devastated  Why do the people I love the most treat me so much worse then I would ever treat them  Are there any people who wont do that  I honestly havent met one  Ive literally never met even one  Not even myself  I hate this  I hate being here,3130,627

1098,p97bhb,0,1,Going back home syndrome The Ultimate gaslight when you have immigrant parents is when they spend your entire childhood convincing you that your situation is temporary  My parents moved a lot and so my Nmom would tell me not to get comfortable in school or bother to make friends because we would move  Jokes on her I was always bullied and had no friends even when I tried  And when we finally settled down somewhere and I was in middle school and started to make some friends  She always spoke terribly about them or said some racist bs  If none of those things worked she would say  well none of this matters because we plan to go back to  third world hone country  we are just here to make money and leave  So in the back of my mind I just was never sure  We have large extended family there and I always thought it was possible  Fast forward almost two decades       And I recommend to my Nmom that we all just move back to  home country  because I got to live there for a year and honestly thought it wasn’t so bad  Her reaction  starts hysterically laughing  Looks at me with disgust saying “we would never move back there   home country  is disgusting and has disgusting people  You’d never survive long term  Keep those ridiculous ideas to yourself ” So we were never going to go back  but I spent my entire child good and teen years filled with anxiety and fear that at any given moment my life would suddenly change because of another move  Pardon my language but Nmom is a fucking bitch and I hate her,1526,279

1108,p95hqd,0,1,The first act of genuine love I ever experienced did more damage to my life than you could possibly imagine  Very long post  Im sorry  My parents never loved me  Im sure all of you experienced the same thing  My mother viewed me as a lapdog that she grew sick of the moment I learned I didnt have to be attached to her  My father viewed me as an embarrassing burden on his life that he never wanted  He told me as much  I grew up with no love  I wasnt allowed to have friends as a child  I suspect many of you grew up the same way  I didnt experience real  genuine love for the very first time until I was   I had a girlfriend  Ill just use her name because theres nothing else identifying about her in this story  her name was Kayla  Kayla and I had a tumultuous relationship  I was extremely messed up mentally and emotionally  and honestly  she was too  I didnt know what love was  I didnt know what it felt like  i didnt know how to express it  I knew nothing about it She watched me suffer for over a year  trying her best to support me  I was very unappreciative of her support  but Ive tried my best to make up for it since then  Anyway  the first act of love  When I was   I was on the brink of ending my life  I was so exhausted from the loveless  abusive  horrifying life I was forced into  She had supported me for so long  at that moment she realized that I needed help beyond what she had to offer So  as I was contemplating the end  she called a social worker  told her about my situation  and the social worker showed up to my front door  Under threat of CPS involvement  my parents begrudgingly had me admitted into a psychiatric hospital  where I stayed for nearly  months  I call this an act of genuine love because Kayla knew how much I would resent her for this  I dreaded and despised the idea of going to one of those hospitals  Id avoid it at all costs  She knew this  she knew I would hate her for making that decision  but she made it anyway She loved me in a way no one else ever had in that moment  She chose my safety and well being over me liking her  over our relationship  She made an impossibly hard decision and she did it because she wanted me to be safe more than she wanted to be in a relationship with me  I was   she uprooted my life more than anyone else had before  and for a while  I did resent her for it  I wasnt mentally stable enough or emotionally mature enough to give her the credit she deserved  so her doing this did destroy our relationship  We didnt speak for nearly three years Her decision was based entirely on love  but it did damage my life severely  I disappeared from school for  consecutive months  My school counselor did everything the state said they could to help me recover from it  but ultimately my GPA dropped from a   to a    just from the sheer amount of schoolwork I missed  Catching up was just about impossible  And honestly  a   GPA is extremely hard to recover from  So my performance in school fell apart when I got back  I gave up on the idea of college because my transcript was beyond fucked before I even got to Sophomore year  When I came back to school  everyone had questions  I disappeared for two entire months without a word  people wanted to know  and I didnt have a story to tell them  Eventually I confided in someone the real reason I was gone  and like a wildfire  word got out that I spent a long time in the psych hospital  So suddenly it was like I was a plague victim  No one wanted to be near me  They thought I was crazy  I lost all my friends  never got them back   I struggled to make new ones because everyone just viewed me as the kid who spent  months in a crazy people hospital  I never really did make new friends after that  I was alone the rest of high school  and yeah  a lot of it was from the bitterness  I was bitter  Who wouldnt be  But the most damaging part of it all  all the walls I had built up to protect myself from my parents  they were gone  Completely gone  And on top of that  now my mother had more ammo to use against me than she ever had before  and she still uses it to this day Anytime I said anything she didnt like  anytime I questioned her or criticized anything she said or did  it was  Is this you talking or the mental illness talking  Every time i expressed an ounce of unhappiness at anything  whether intentional or not  it was  dont take it out on me just because  youre  mentally ill She would make a point to go into my room every couple weeks and ask  so     are you still crazy or has that gone away yet    the exact words she used  She did this every few weeks for  years  Anytime I was unhappy  anytime I didnt like something  anytime I protested  anytime I did or said    anything    that she wasnt favorable of  it was  this isnt you  youre just sick  One decision fucked up my life so fucking badly  And that decision was the very first act of genuine love I ever had in my entire love Can you imagine how complicated of a feeling that is The  first time anyone ever loves me   and it    destroys    me  Kayla and I made amends some while ago  and I still send her a text every few weeks to let her know that I appreciate her  She was honestly the first person in my life to ever actually love me  and Ill never forget that  But  just imagine how you would feel if you went  years with a life   void of love  and then the first love you ever feel destroys your life for the next  years,5536,1045

1115,p94xze,0,1,No Contact Letter   Kids involved I told my nmom that I wanted her to  stop contacting me almost  months ago  but she did not listen  no surprise there   I had only told her over the phone  so I am going to write a letter asking her to stop contacting me so that I have the option to pursue a restaining order against her if she still ignores my request  Our situation is complicated because we have a daughter in elementary school who she wants control of  She texts me exery other week asking to be able to take our daughter for the night or for dinner without us present  and only twice in the  months did she ever even ask how my daughter was doing  or about how horrible of a daughter and mother I am for doing this to her and keeping her away from our daughter  She sends packages of random gifts to our house for my daughter  Backstory We originally decided to go NC with my nmom because she undermined us as parents and was trying to raise our daughter to be like herself and my sister   the golden child  She acted as if she and I were divorced parents and she was the one who could decide how our daughter would be raised  She has never accepted my boyfriend as a father to our daughter because he is not her biological father even though he has been her only father figure and has been since she was almost yo  She used to take our daughter for the weekends but then our daughter would come back and behave horribly at our house and was not developing a sense of self  acting instead like a carbon copy of my nmom and gc sister  She would have extended family visit and would not tell us and instead do activities with the extended family acting as though she was our daughters mother  which is how her side of the family treats them   we do not exist apparently   Any time she would invite us to do something with them as well it was always only to use our car or because she wanted us to help with   do all of   some sort of manual labor while they hung out  She would ignore basic safety such as requiring our dauhgter to wear a seatbelt on  short drives   She also constantly threatened to call the cops on me for the welfare of our daughter if we would not meet up exactly when she wanted for her to take our daughter for the weekend  Before we decided to go NC  I did try to talk to her over the phone about the issues we were having but instead of listening and trying to work on a solutions she decided to attack me as a daughter and as a mother before screaming profanities at me and hanging upon me  We then told her she could only visit our daughter at our house  not keep her overnight or take her out without us  She would not acknowledge the conversation after and temporarily said she needed to remove herself from our lives  This was when we saw a HUGE positive change in our family structure and our daughters behavior so we decided that we wanted to continue NC instead of LC  She has since threatened to take us to court for grandparents visitation rights  but it has been a month since she was supposed to have filed and I have not been served so I am hoping that it was either just a threat or she didnt have enough of a case to take me to court  I have saved all of her texts over the past six months  as well as the voicemails she had left threatening to call the cops on us for having  our own  child with us  I also have taken pictures of all of the random gifts she has left on our porch or had mailed to us,3457,673

1123,p948up,0,1,NMom compares me to other kids  despite holding me back from a lot of things growing up  There were a few instances  like just now  where she sees a video of some kid playing the violin really well and goes on to tell me   that could have been you    But she discounts the fact that she didnt want to continue to pay for lessons after one summer of classes  that was more or less  sessions    I wanted the lessons  but she always told us growing up to think that we were poor  and that we could only afford the necessities  She wanted me to teach myself instead  I was  or   I didnt have the discipline to learn everything on my own Same goes for everything else I wanted to try out when I was younger  It always felt like a burden for her spend extra on me  And again  always telling us to think that were poor  because shes a single parent   Despite that  she still overspends on groceries  buys expensive makeup  gadgets  and prioritizes travel to expensive countries at least once a year   Come to think of it  we werent poor  Shes just not good with money  She just didnt want to spend on things she didnt feel like spending on  Thats why she beat me up when I almost didnt get my financial aid scholarship in college  Thats why I was barely scraping by with my allowance  and didnt get to save up  But if you ask her  shell say that its her money  and that she can do whatever she wants with it,1428,268
1124,p944s0,0,1,Emotionally Manipulative Mother Alright so long story short my dad and moms side of family dont get along  My cousin didnt invite my mom to his wedding because his dad apparently told him not to  Anyhow my grandparents are living in the same town and my cousin and his wife are in town visiting and my dad wanted me to go visit them  So my mom pretty much does not want me going to my grandparents place because they treated her like crap and my uncle said shit about her  which she found out by putting recorders in my dads car   I mean fair but that is their fight  On the other hand my dad gets pissed if I dont go  hes like youve been so brainwashed by your mom  Its a lose lose situation either way  so I figured why not just go and show them that Im not gonna resort to my familys level of pettiness that I will go out of formality and politeness  truth be told I could not give a less sh  t about anyone in my family  I would rather just live a quiet life without talking to family members  although unfortunately I decided to come home from uni for the summer to save money  and maybe there was a part of me that thought I would be able to cope with the emotional abuse of my parents  yes ik it was the wrong choice   I dont wanna be on anyones bad side so I just gotta navigate through it til I can leave in  weeks  Its just so frustrating  In the past Ive pretty much lied by omission by not telling my mom that Im going to my grandparents place  She finds out anyways somehow  She once confronted me and was like why didnt you tell me  And I was like you usually have a bad reaction when I tell you and then she was like oh so now you lie to me  who knows what else youve lied about  I mean quite a bit lmao   But then she completely denied that she had a bad reaction and was like i didnt get angry that you told me  Hooray gas lighting  So I was like ok this time I will tell her before going  she definitely had a bad reaction  She started calling me names  said ok now theyve managed to sway you to their side  my dads side  Ive definitely told her Im neutral and not taking anyones side but its like talking to a wall   like youre completely cut off from me I dont wanna talk to you ever again  and started banging her head against the wall  And honestly I just felt so disconnected emotionally and for the first time in a long time her messed up behaviour didnt bother me  If anyone it solidified my choice to go because I wanted to show her hey you cant do all this crap and then expect me to fold and do whatever you want  Like you cant control me by doing that  It was a relief because I was kind of saying screw you to mom and releasing some of her hold over me  But now shes giving me the silent treatment and Im definitely not gonna fold and apologize to her  And I quite frankly am tired of being the only one that tries with my parents  I have repeatedly told them both that if you gotta problem with me  just sit down and calmly talk it out with me and that silent treatment solves nothing   Ive been clear with my needs and wants but they dont really respect them  Its their way or no way  I also wont be coming back next summer or again unless its to visit for a long weekend or something  I am done with my parents  they either try to meet me halfway or lose me  I just wanted to vent about this and maybe get some advice as well,3393,666

1135,p92e2j,0,2,My bf wants to meet my n parents    I don’t think he really gets why that’s a bad idea My family has decided to fly over to visit me from across the country “whether I like it or not ” My mother is the main narcissist parent who’s made this decision  despite the fact that I have told her I have no interest in a visit  Unfortunately  they know where I live  and although they won’t be trying to stay with me  they will likely show up at my doorstep unannounced and harass me into talking to or acknowledging them  My boyfriend knows this is the premise of their visit and the history of abuse I’ve received from both my parents especially my mother  but for some reason he’s expressed interest in meeting them  He’s not being pushy and he said he’s happy not to if I don’t want to  but it definitely seems like he wants to  I’m kind of confused and upset that he seems to have this idea that it will be a pleasant experience considering he knows my history with them  I’d like to get him to understand why having my mother meet my new boyfriend is like exposing the flesh of my soft underbelly to a hungry lion  She’s going to find anyway she can to prey on my insecurities and poison my happiness any way she can  and meeting him is just giving her ammunition  I explained that idea to him about how she weaponizes people I care about and other reasons why it would be a bad idea  He doesn’t argue with me or push me to introduce him  but he doesn’t really seem to get why it’s such a bad idea It bothers me that he doesn’t understand or that he might have the lingering desire and curiosity about meeting these people  It feels like he somehow really doesn’t understand how bad it was growing up with them despite all I’ve told him  And that feels really invalidating and concerning Has anyone else faced this difficulty with “meeting the parents” and their significant other  And if so  how did you finally get them to understand that introducing them to your family wasn’t going to be the warm and fuzzy relationship milestone they might expect it to be,2076,383
1136,p92c7b,0,2,My mom is obsessed with me and Im not sure how to leave her without problems Ive never really posted to Reddit before  but Im not sure where to go with this issue  NSFW because I mention sex  Im not sure if its needed  but I thought it would be best to put just in case I am  years old  and my mom continuously gets upset over me placing boundaries  Recently  she has been obsessing over my sex life  She told me she was losing sleep over thinking about it  She didnt catch me in the act of anything  she just made assumptions and thought too much about me hanging out with friends  She also stalked my bank account and figured out payments were from a  certain popular adult site   and has been accusing me of not deleting the account when I told her I did delete it  She says she can  find out  if I still have the account and was talking about hiring a private investigator to find it  The account had nothing to do with my friends  but she then accused me of being a prostitute  when I am not  A month ago she told me I needed to be given as much psychiatric medication as possible just because I enjoyed sex  Yes  that was the reason  Each sentence around that statement was regarding my sex life  so it couldnt have been for any other reason  It was all while she was yelling at me when I just got off of a night shift at work  She insisted that I shouldnt have sex ever  I had only been seeing one person the whole time and I saw them once a month  She was saying extremely paranoid things that night  claiming my ex killed children    She screamed at me to pack my shit and leave  but when I did  she screamed at me that I wasnt allowed to move out  She told me that anyone who says theyll help me will only use me and that any man that talks to me is just going to use me for sex  She insists that Ill get kidnapped for walking around during the day and looks at local missing persons almost everyday  She thinks everyone is a sex trafficker and theres no way to reason with her  She worries about pedophiles targeting me even though Im  and I do not look like a child  She tells me that Im easy to manipulate and thinks everyone I talk to has it out for me    She accused my coworkers of talking smack about me  when my coworkers are all grown adults with children She does not have any friends  she does not have a boyfriend  she doesnt even have an ex husband  She doesnt go to work  I dont know what to do for her  Ive tried talking to my colleges counseling service  but they couldnt really help me or give me advice  Every friend Ive talked to has told me to get out of my home ASAP  I wont be able to pay for college if I leave and I never had a parent who could teach me about how to actually survive in the real world because she never wanted me to leave   When I talked about adopting a kitten and taking the kitten with me when I moved out  she told me I wasnt moving out  Cats live up to  years  I would be  years old when the cat dies   I have no idea what to do or where to go or what I even can do  The way she treats me makes me feel crazy  shes always talking about how no one else has good intentions for me and how everyone is lying to me  I am dealing with my own mental issues from years of abuse and I cannot be her best friend and her therapist  Im scared to even make a second bank account to save money without her knowing because I dont want the mail to arrive to my house because she looks through my mail and packages  I really appreciate any sort of guidance or even just reassurance that Im not insane for wanting to move out  Sorry if this doesnt belong here and sorry if I added too much or explained some things too much  I left out a lot of other things shes done  I feel like this is already really long,3797,739
1137,p929gs,0,2,Finally cut contact with my narcissist mother Hi all First time posting  but I need some support or advice Yesterday  my mother  younger sister and I   female  went to a water park together  The whole day  my mom would constantly bring up that I don’t talk to her much  but it’s her job as a mother to warn me about what the Bible says about my “lifestyle choices”  I’m lesbian for context   I kept telling her I didn’t want to talk about it  but she would loudly say “ok but just don’t be mad at me ”  so I felt very awkward as people started to stare at us  At one point I just said  “I don’t think the church would want someone like me ” To which she  again  loudly  said “what do you have against Christians ” She would then keep picking at my appearance  like “you know  you were prettier when your hair was longer”  “you should stop trying to be nerdy like your brother and just be yourself ”  or “you should really lose some weight”  At the end of the night  I was emotionally drained  and I felt like garbage  I talked to my best friend  and we decided that the best thing for me to do now is to cut contact with my mom  so I can finally focus on healing  I’m afraid she’s going to tell everyone how I’m such a “bad daughter” because I won’t talk to her  or that “the devil” convinced me to cut ties  I just don’t want people to think ill of me  but I need to start healing after so many years of abuse and neglect  Am I doing the right thing,1459,280
1138,p926n8,0,2,Are Narcs Cruel or Delusional Nmom finally let me move out at  but she still pays for a lot of things because it makes her feel superior in control like god   Also I am a college student so I can’t work full time  I have fibromyalgia from the fear and stress that she has put me through and drilled into my head  She made me get a dietitian and tested for any micronutrient deficiencies because she was convinced I had a vitamin deficiency  She bought me epsom salt and would sometimes make baths for me But the abuse and the small jabs and cuts and the severe fear she has instilled in me has been severe in my lifetime  I’ve had psychosis twice where I’ve tried to escape and both times she would just scream at me during my panic attacks  After going to the hospital and getting psychiatric help she wouldn’t let me leave the house for a month or drive and would act like a nurse withholding meds because ‘too much lorazepam is bad for your brain’  I was having panic attacks and having to beg her for my medication  I was  Does she know the damage she has done or is she delusional  She helps pay for therapists and encourages me to go because she realizes I have anxiety but doesn’t realize it’s from her  She says I act like a moody teenager and that I’m rebelling  I have severe anxiety and ocd from the abuse  I self sabotage and am scared most of the time I’ve been trying to get out since I was  and didn’t even realize how severe and fucked up the abuse was Mom is clearly delusional but how can someone be that delusional  Damn narcs  Lol  She sees herself as a mom that has dedicated her entire life to her kids  She sees herself as savior and hero and god  It’s insane,1699,317
1139,p921sn,0,8,Not Her Life’s Greatest Joy Long time lurker  first time poster   Do not steal my post…  Growing up  I was the scapegoat child   My younger sister was the Golden Child   I have been  NC with my mother for  years after being VVLC for  years My sister  the GC  previously admitted she “overdramatizes” anything bad I do and “minimizes” anything bad she does when she is angry with me because she knows our mother will be her attack dog    I am also NC with her Anyway   The reason for this   My sister  the GC  recently celebrated her birthday   My mother posted on SM the following   “Happy Birthday GC NAME   my life’s greatest joy ”Several years ago  she posted that GC was “the best daughter ever ”  💔 I know  I know   Why the hell do I look   Because I keep hoping that one day she will regret the pain she caused  I know she won’t   But no matter how much time passes  the hope is still there,910,177
1140,p91w9f,0,2,The only thing keeping me going right now is imagining how good of a mom Ill be  Ill tell my kids I love them every day  because i cant remember the last time my mom told me that  Ill be happy to have them invite their friends over and let them go out to spend time with others  because my parents would never let me go anywhere without terrorizing me about it for days in advance of and after the event  Ill give them physical affection like hugs  of course only with their consent   because my mom always used to push me away  and I dont accept my dads hugs anymore because he hugs me and tells me he loves me one second  and literally throws me across the room the next  I will not have my kids feel so unhealthily needy of their friends love and affection as i feel today  because theyll be getting lots of love at home  Ill let them have sleepovers  because the first time i had one was when i was   and the morning after my parents bombarded my phone  make me leave super early while all the other kids were allowed to go to the public pool together  and yelled insults at me over the phone to the point where i broke down crying at the train station  I will earn their respect and treat them like normal human beings  because my parents always automatically expected me to respect them after all the awful things they said to me  I will acknowledge their problems and mental health and do my best to help them  because all my parents do while Im having panic attacks  which they caused  by the way  was yelling at me to shut up and not be dramatic  laugh about and mimic the way i cried  and throw a pity party about how their life is so much worse  Ill teach them how to be independent and allow them to make independent choices at all ages  to the point of letting my toddler choose their own clothes  because due to my parents sheltering and controlling i still dont know how to do basically anything on my own and highly depend on my friends at  years old  Ill give them constant reassurance  because i never got that and am needy for reassurance by everyone around me Ill talk to them in a normal tone no matter how upset they make me  because to this day i still get panic attacks from people shouting  and start shaking uncontrollably at every somewhat heated discussion  because my parents lashed out at every minor inconvenience i caused  My children will always feel like they can trust their mom with absolutely anything without fearing abuse  because all my parents taught me was how to make up lies on the spot  fearing another fight  Ill seek help for my own mental battles and not project my own feelings onto my children  because my mom always made me feel responsible for her  miserable  life  and Im always the one comforting my dad after yet another fit he threw like the manchild he is  acting like i love and understand him  even though all i want to achieve is have him calm down and stop terrorizing my mom and siblings I will recognize when my partner is being abusive  and react in an appropriate manner  because my mother failed to do that for  years now  I will not enable abusive partners and always  always put my kids first  because instead of defending me against my dad  my mom joins in to yell shit at me No matter what happens  i will throw my own feelings aside and swallow my pride when my kids are having a problem  because my parents never seemed to care about me venting about my feelings  and keep yelling insults and one upping me with their own problems I will admit my mistakes and apologize to my children for any wrongdoings on my side  because my parents feel too good for that and either laugh at me or worse when i do muster up the courage to demand an apology from them  I will make board game nights  which they wont be obliged to attend   because as long as I can remember i used to beg my parents to play games with me  which they obviously almost always declined  I will respect their privacy  because to this day my parents barge into my room without knocking and laugh at me when I ask them to I will give them space when they need it  because my parents keep guilttripping me for wanting alone time  I will keep every single thing they make  because my parents threw away my drawings from kindergarten  saying it didnt matter because they where ugly anyways  I wont get in my teenage kids business as long as they let me know theyre safe  because every somewhat nice   typically teenage  thing i did was behind my parents backs We will sit down to discuss problems  and Ill let them have their turn to tell their side of the story and express their feelings  because all my parents taught me about problem solving is yelling vile insults at each other until someone finally breaks I will keep my marriage relationship problems between my partner and I  because some of the earliest memories i have is my parents hitting each other with our kitchen chairs and me picking up and handing my dad the wedding ring my mom threw across the room when i was no older than  or   And because of the fact that she still didnt leave him I will sit them down to explain to them WHY i dont want them to do certain things  because all my parents did was demonize and make a taboo out of everything remotely bad  which only made me more curious about them I will respect their belongings  because i still get insanely uncomfortable seeing damaged toys  because my mom used to rip apart my favorite plushies and break my toys when i didnt behave  I wont allow demonization of minorities in my household  and openly talk about and explain what discrimination  bullying etc is and why its unacceptable  because my parents always tried to make me hate myself for being queer and having foreign friends I will make it clear that while school is a great tool for them to succeed later on in life  never will i make them feel like their academic successes define them  because ever since elementary school  my parents pressured me into succeeding  just so they could brag about it to their friends  I remember them telling me that me failing would ruin THEIR reputation all throughout elementary till now  While Ill show them my own morals and values  i will always reason my ways of doing things  while also letting them know that they can be whoever and however they want to be  because in the end its their own life  and Im just there to give them a good headstart and support them through everything  Because my parents teared me down for ANYTHING about me that differed from them  from wanting to adopt children rather than have biological ones  to being an atheist I will respect their career choices  because when i told my parents i wanted to be a therapist  they made fun of me whenever i showed any sign of emotional intelligence  or attempted to talk openly about how they made me feel   oh so youre trying to be a psychiatrist to us now  Go talk about that psycho shit to someone else once you even get to that point  if you even get that far   They still say  psychiatrist  even though I always corrected them to  therapist   Little things like this matter   When i then told them i wanted to be a teacher  they said similar things about how i was trying to teach them things and that i should  know my place  as the child And needless to say  no physical OR emotional abuse will ever be tolerated This got long  and it still doesnt even capture a fraction of what else i could talk about  And obviously most of these are the absolute bare minimum  and Ill do lots more  This was just a quick vent You get my point  Never  ever will my children have to feel like they have to hide ANYTHING from me  And never  ever will they feel like they have to walk on eggshells in my household  because i might lash out on them  Never  This thought is what keeps me going  and is what Im using to calm myself down in stressful situations at home  I may still be pretty young  but that doesnt keep me from practicing how Ill finally break the cycle and have my kids take a loving home for granted,8173,1477
1141,p91s00,0,2,“Crying doesn’t count if I can hear you” Basically the gist of what my mom told me growing up  She has a very unhealthy view of depression and I’m assuming she sees it in a “Hollywood” way where it only “counts” if you actively try to conceal it  My older sister fell sick with an eating disorder in her teens  and from that point forward my mom  covert narc  became overprotective of my sister and did anything and everything it took to make my sister’s life easier  It made this weird phenomenon happen where my mom decided I was “stronger” and “tougher” than my sister  I was four years younger  and I often had to give up things to make my sister happy  and just generally carry the emotional load  take care of my sister and protect her  Some family members started emotionally abusing me at the time  and my mom admitted a few years later that she never did anything about it because she was afraid if she protected me  they would go after my sister  I developed an eating disorder too  but over eating  not under eating  so my mom was largely unconcerned because she thinks it’s only a problem if you’re too thin and too depressed to eat Anyway  my sister tried to conceal most of her problems and hide her depression throughout that time  which made my mom obsessive with helping her  to the point of too strongly involving herself in my sister’s privacy  and also forcing her to go to therapy kicking and screaming  My sister is a grown adult now  much recovered  who my mom still thinks is too weak to function in this world  However  when I started developing all  my  problems as a teen  I could just never seem to get my mom’s attention for it  I wanted to be helped like my sister was  Instead  for example  my mom once caught me hurting myself  but she just got angry  screamed at me  and grounded me for it  Every moment of acting out just seemed to aggravate and annoy my mom further  but not make her worry about me  I suspect it’s because I was very outspoken that I needed help  which didn’t work in my mom’s book  because you have to not want people to know you’re depressed if you’re actually depressed  I had to beg to be taken to therapy  The title of this post happened when I was crying one night for over an hour after bedtime  and my mom pounded on my door and told me to shut up and that I was only doing it for attention  I tried to tell her I wasn’t  but she replied that she used to cry into her pillow as a teenager  but she did it so softly that no one could hear  because that’s what it actually means to be depressed  She could hear me  so it meant I didn’t actually need help  To this day  I still have imposter syndrome towards my own feelings  P S  Nothing against my sister  I’m glad she got help and I genuinely think she needed it more  I only resent my mom for how she handled our situations,2849,533
1142,p91kvq,0,10,I wish I didnt have a father than to have an abusive one  Hes an alcoholic for starters   so for the first days I can recall of my childhood  the event of him abusing my sister and nearly blinding her with his fist shook me  he used to beat me too for no reason but I always thought its okay Some other things include him pulling up a weapon on our cat   for more context  the cat could go in and out of the house from the windows and then one night it annoyed him to the point where he went to pick and charge his rifle and started looking for it to shoot  Having all this happened as I was young affected me in many ways He also never stood up for me  once I broke down crying in front of him   for personal   family  conflict   I was older this time   he just walked past me and didnt care  I witnessed him cheat on my mother on several occasions  even while once she was in a surgery  He treats his friends better than all of us  and only cares about himself  When he cooks something  its sure as hell he wont give you some He is also bipolar and so hypocrite because he says he wants one thing  then the very next minute can argue and yell against that very thing and that very thing has caused enough problems There are just so many other things   big or small actions but I feel like not saying it all because its exhausting to think off I always was willing to forget about the past and tried to get close to him  wanted something as simple as a call or a how are you  let alone hear i love you he didnt even know what levels of study I was at  he probably doesnt keep count now too I always looked for him in other people  but I think its a hole in my heart that cant be filled by anyone I guess  Its a broken glass that cant be fixed Thank you for reading this  it has been forever in my heart Ps  Im a girl,1838,366
1143,p91im0,0,6,Why do parents think that creating a child means they can treat it how they like  Vent This is kind of general but I feel like npd particularly in parents might be an extreme of a general attitude of parents who have kids and feel they can do as they please because they brought you into this world keep a roof over your head   do the bare minimum  This is probably obvious but  Like why does everyone want to protect parents  Why aren’t parents held accountable  Unless you had a gun to your head like nobody forced you to have children  and even if there were a set of complicated factors that forced you into that situation I feel like in a lot of cases this can still be considered abusive and selfish to say the least  Yes mum  you did make sacrifices  And mistakes  I asked for neither  In fact  I didn’t even ask to be born  so chew on that after your only child stops talking to you,891,170

1150,p90khn,0,5,narcissism or “peter pan syndrome”  note  i have a question but i wasn’t expecting to vent so much  so i’m using the rant vent flair  if this goes against a policy i missed while reading the rules i apologize    hello all  i’ve been a lurker on this sub for a long time  i’m F and i’ve had suspicions that my mother is a narcissist  i’m not a professional or anything and i don’t intend to diagnose her my mother has been single for most of my life  after my step dad split when i was around   she dated for a while but now i think she’s finished with the dating scene i am not an only child but i have a large age difference with my sibling so i consider my experience to be similar  i have been anxious for most of my life  my mother is a very high strung person  she is incredibly sensitive and defensive and does not do well in times of stress  i have always been the one cleaning up her messes  apologizing to store clerks after her public freak outs  trying my best to cool her down in the aftermath  and so on  my mother has said she doesn’t know what she’d do without me  she says it almost every day  it leaves me feeling almost paralyzed in living my own life  people ask what i’m doing with my life  or what i want to do…  and i just don’t know  i make things up on the spot just to keep the conversation flowing  because how do i explain that i have no drive to live my own life because i’ve lived most of it picking up my mother’s pieces  i’m fucking exhausted and i haven’t even really lived yet anyway  i would argue my mother is pretty smart  or at least somewhat intelligent  she has some interests that are intellectual and mature and she’s very knowledgeable when it comes to certain topics  however… she does this thing where she will sometimes sound like a child for no reason  it’s hard for me to even explain  but like  she will randomly put on the voice of a little kid  it could be for anything  at any time and anywhere  she will have a blank stare when i say something simple and respond like a child  it’s embarrassing when we’re in public and she suddenly starts acting like this but it’s mostly harmless and doesn’t last long  other times she will have full on tantrums and will scream and holler over small inconveniences  it’s impossible for me to get through to her when she’s like this  and if i do  it’s usually her just saying whatever it takes to shut me up  “yeah you’re right ” “ok i understand  stop yelling at me ” etcmy question  is there more to this that i’m missing  do these traits sound similar to those of true narcissists  or does she sound more like an adult with peter pan syndrome  is there much overlap here  fwiw  my mother does show signs of empathy  and it seems genuine to me but i’m not sure i can even trust my own judgment  she is generous to people on the street  amp  neighbors  she cries at sad movies  etc  idk  i know i’m rambling here but any insight is appreciated TLDR  can someone exhibit traits of both NPD and peter pan syndrome  how can you differentiate between the two disorders,3069,569
1151,p902hu,0,6,So my gf found my nmom’s self drawn porn and I finally have answers I just came home to her saying she’s traumatized before handing me a stack of papers I couldn’t read  There were a lot of badly drawn images and a lot seemed very kinky  dragons fucking elves  a page on different types of Nymphs and how to fuck them  My mom would always asume things were sexual when I was little  and would often say I couldn’t sit or wear certain things or else I would be a slut  I never thought of my mother as a sexual human  given she was as strict as a parent in the Victorian era when it came to modestyBut nowOh my godIf more people want to be traumatized by this I can upload the pictures lmao,697,135

1153,p901so,0,6,Today for the first time I have not regressed  I dont care what it cost  I do not have to do it  I am not the one who is wrong  The gray rock has not turned out well  My mother has punished me without going out for  ignoring  her  that is  not telling her about my problems or what I do with my friends  Not engaging in conversations with them  And just saying good night when I get home after leaving   So according to her she has had enough and this will not continue  and although she has not taken the phone from me yet  she has said that she will  When she realizes Im not going to change she will getting worse  I dont have to tell her anything  She does not deserve it  And she will use the information against me  I made the mistake of told her that I drink alcohol in a party  And now  she said that I am a alcohol adict  which Im not  Even I dont like the taste so I dont drink to much   and that I smoke weed  I never told her anything like that   lmao So  now  I wont say anything to her anymore She says Im spiteful because I reminded her that she tried to choke me a few months ago  And that I am the aggressive one to defend myself  lmaooooooo  And when I made a post about this  many warned me that it could get worse  it hasnt  However  she said  In the end we will have to come to blows  Implicitly implying that something like this could happen again  I dont think it will happen  because social services warned her that they could send me to a juvenile center  Nmom  Im not giving in and you can throw all the tantrums or punishments you want  I am not doing anything wrong  it is not my fault nor am I the one causing all this  I will not fall into Gaslighting again  Even in this situation  I feel very powerful knowing that she cant control my behaviour Every  verbal  fight  every provocation or innuendo makes it clearer for me to go to NC and let it rot by itself,1922,369
1154,p9006n,0,6,Anyone else trying to heal their relationship to parenthood  My whole life  my grandmother has told me that me being born basically ruined my mother’s life  and  of course  hers   She told me that being pregnant almost killed my mother  that if it wasn’t for me she never would have developed a brain tumor  she would have been able to hold down a job  she would have stayed with my father  she wouldn’t be dependent on my grandmother  etc  Logically  I know this is all bullshit  My mother has never once made me feel like I was responsible for any of the things my grandmother claimed I was  Even when she talks about having to take a semester off from college because her pregnancy was hard on her  She takes every opportunity to tell me that I’m her whole world  and that none of those things are even close to being my fault  My mother was born with a neurological disability  My grandmother has spent her whole life perpetuating ableist rhetoric that my mother’s illness and subsequent comorbidities  dyslexia  anxiety depression  chronic fatigue  weight gain  weak immune system  etc   are a moral failing  and that if my mother would just listen to her and do what she says then she’d be “hEaLtHiEr ThAn A nOrMaL pErSoN ” This  in addition to saying that me being born did nothing but make her life infinitely harder So  because of this  my grandmother impressed on me that I should never have children  She insisted I do penance for the sin I committed by being born by never having children  lest I risk repeating my mother’s mistakes  Subconsciously  I’ve actively avoided anything related to babies or children or parenthood because the first comment out of my grandmother’s mouth would be  “YOU’RE not going to have children anytime SOON  are you ” Before going on a tirade about everything I’ve already mentioned  It went so far that when I had to start taking birth control at   on a low  not enough to prevent pregnancy dosage  to treat my own chronic illness  my grandmother was convinced that I was lying and that I was intentionally asking for a low dosage so I could wind up pregnant  Even when I went to college  she would interrogate me about whether or not I was dating so she could catch me lying about being sexually active  It’s only now at almost  that I’m trying to be comfortable about the fact that  at some point in my life  I want to get married and have kids  Maybe not a bunch  but at least one  It’s a discomfort I had only just realized  My friend asked me  “Why do you always say ‘if’ you get married or have kids  I think you’d be a great mom ” That I actually stood back and thought about it Is this just me or have other people had similar journeys,2701,478

1158,p8zkbu,0,11,Tips for No Contact with nMom   Hello  The title really gets to the point  but if a little explaining helps feel free to keep reading  Essentially Im just looking for tips or advice on no contact  I feel like Ive been at the edge of no contact so many times and failed by giving in to quickly  But every time I do  the next flare up is x worse I want to go no contact with my mom  I want to really pull the trigger this time  I could probably write forever about every incident  but I wont  Ill just explain what feels like the final straw this time My mom has always had a problem with me making friends or relationships outside of my parents and brother  and to be honest  she doesnt like me having relationships with my dad or brother either   Always finding reasons someone wasnt good enough for me or convincing me Im better off with just her and that our circle  more like a line with only two points   me and her  is the only thing that matters in life  Fast forward to when I turned  and got the hell out of dodge and met my present day husband  He is amazing  My husband accepted my moms crazy tendencies and comforted supported me throughout everything  However  I can tell it definitely wears even him down  How could it not In my moms usual fashion  she of course of the years tried saying things to convince me I should leave him  Anything from nitpicking his career choice  that he has two sons  now my step sons   hes too calm to straight up fabricating lies  Shes tried to convince me that she thinks he is cheating on me  doesnt love me or worst of all  she tried telling me she thinks that he is abusing our son  we have one child together on top of his two sons from a previous relationship   None of which she had any basis for  Just her suspicion or gut feeling  On top of all that  she constantly flirts with him by feeling his muscles and trying to touch him or a few Thanksgivings ago she even got drunk and took her shirt off in front of him in the other room claiming it to be an accident  my husband immediately told me within seconds of it happening   Obviously  my mom has issues About  months ago she fabricated something new  told me that she thinks my husband is sexually assaulting our son  All because he had a rash on his bum when she was babysitting  I told her that is a very extreme accusation to make and that our  year old has been backtracking a bit with potty training  specifically    and sometimes he goes only a little bit and doesnt tell us  causing slight rashes   I told her I would not be having this conversation again and that I didnt want to hear her accusing my husband of something so horrible with no real basis  I know my husband and he wouldnt even hurt a fly She dropped the topic for awhile  but still pushed her luck by trying to bring it up  more times  my fault I know  I should have told her enough is enough sooner   Finally she brought it up again a couple nights ago  along with how she feels like I dont love her or spend enough time with her   which is intentional as I was trying to go low contact   I basically said this is too much and that I dont want to have a relationship with her anymore  I cant keep listening to her fabrications and having   hours arguments on the phone   times a day  She literally takes up my whole life for days when she gets like this to the point that I just give in and try to smooth it over so I can move on and get back to focusing on work and my own household  She tried putting my dad on the phone to convince me I was wrong  her go to tap in move when she feels like she is losing power   but I simply told him its late and I have kids still awake because Ive been neglecting them for this argument and Im done  The next day she called and I ignored it because I was working  she doesnt understand the concept because she doesnt work and hasnt for decades   It felt so good to not pick up  Usually I always pick up because if I dont I have to hear her say What if I was dying  I knew you didnt love me  and it always ensues an argument  When I didnt pick up  she immediately flooded my phone with text messages  Most of which I truly couldnt understand because she was just all over the place with her topics  But it felt like she was trying to back track and in a weird round about way  apologize somehow  I only sent one text back letting her know I was working and that this wasnt a conversation to be easily had while doing so  Plus  it was open house night at school for my step sons and I wanted to be there for it  I texted her back at some point in the evening letting her know that I just dont want to have a close relationship with her and that she cant respect boundaries  She asked if she could still see my son  her only biological grandkid  and I told her I wouldnt keep him from her  My mom then said fine and to let her know from now on every Sunday evening via text when are good days times to see him  Yeah  of course she had to find a way to control that too  I didnt care though if it meant creating the necessary distance However  she keeps trying to push the envelope and I know she is trying to open a conversation with me again  right now Im just being very dry and to the point and not talking unless necessary   She keeps trying to text and ask if my step sons want to hang out with her  which she never cared about until recently  or request to talk on the phone to my son more than she normally would   its literally been  days since I told her I dont want a relationship I know this was already a lot without me even going down every avenue  so thank you if you made it this far  Again  Im just looking for advice for how to go no contact because I feel like Im close and I know its going to be a long process but I really dont want to back track now and have to start over  But I can feel her trying to be submissive and feel things out  I know she is waiting for a good moment to have the next blow up and get me to break down  Her birthday is next week and then its my sons birthday in  weeks  I know she will want to try and fix things in time for that and if Im honest Im not sure how to avoid letting her come to my sons birthday   but Im also scared for how shell act because she doesnt mind making a scene in front of others Im incredibly anxious to pull the trigger on no contact  I keep walking around my house making sure all the windows and doors are locked and cameras are working because she has broken in to my house in the past to start a fight when I ignored her before  I shouldnt be scared of my own mom  but I am  I know last time I should have called the police and filed a restraining order  I wish I did  but it all just took me by surprise  If she ever does it again I will be more prepared mentally  but it still scares me a bit Any advice is greatly appreciated  Thank you,6928,1339
1159,p8zgul,0,2,One of my first clear memories I have of my nDad was him invalidating me  I was  years old  amp  my dad was having me blow my nose into a tissue  a tissue that he had literally just used to blow his own nose   I remember him using the tissue on me  feeling his mucus that was already on the tissue get on my face  being disgusted   amp  speaking up to him saying that I didnt want to use that tissue because he was getting his snot on my face with it    He then quickly replied something to the effect of  The same snot that is in me is in you    amp  then continued wiping his snot rag on my face  in spite of my objection    What the hell does that even mean  We share a significant amount of the same DNA  so my natural aversion to not have his snot touching my face was therefore invalid    Really  what this displayed was an early indicator of his complete lack of distinction between where he ended  amp  I began  or regard for my own personal autonomy   to any degree    I wouldnt even want to re use a tissue that had my own mucus on it  My little voiced concern was COMPETELY justified  but not to nDad    The idea of me speaking up  amp  saying that I didnt want his snot touching my face was silly  amp  could rightly just be disregarded because  well  I AM HIM   in his mind   My snot  his snot   whats the difference   I was just an extenstion of him  not an individual little person with their own feelings   This might seem a little trivial  but this is one of the clearest early memories I have of my nDad   amp  it really set the tone for many of the experiences I had to deal with going forward     no right to set any boundaries  no right to any personal autonomy  nothing valid to say that went against anything he was doing  amp  or wanted to do that involved me,1816,354
1160,p8z3ju,0,4,Trying to forgive my parents but I have undiagnosed disorders from childhood and they blame them on me as an adult  triggering negative cycles  tw  everything tbh  so    i’m not sure where to even start but as a quick run through  i was raised upper middle class and my mother and father were separated  years before she passed away when i was   neither of them knew that i was being sexually abused since around age  and i was always quiet and showed symptoms of autism and adhd  after my mom passed my dad moved us out of the house and remarried  i went from having two bedrooms to myself  to sleeping on a futon in the game room  my dad then accepted a job out of town so i was essentially being raised by my step mom and he would come back on weekends  i was a daddy’s girl but by time this shift happened  whenever he did come home he treated me like i was ugly and belittled me and most of my genuine interests  this caused me to become even more closed off and mean so i tried to stay to myself  they would then call me lazy and say i didn’t care about anything when it was clear signs of depression and adhd  they ignored the signs and i was secretly suicidal and self harming middle school through high school  in   in college  i was sexually assaulted by my best friend  was being abused by all organizations i was in  was drugged at a party and had a suicide attempt in the same night  and had a very public fall of reputation    but at the same time i was undergoing a spiritual awakening that essentially showed me my worth and saved me  i’ve tried to do my best since then and i have healed my self esteem and other areas of my life but it’s clear that i now strongly show every symptom of borderline personality disorder  ptsd  adhd  and could’ve been born with mild autism   my parents cut me off at the beginning of the pandemic and only swoop in if my situation is damaging to their reputation  i’m inbetween housing right now and was fighting everyday to be optimistic  just to go to my dads bday party last weekend where they revealed they bought the large lake house across the street from their  bed home  this completely triggered a public meltdown from me and i’m ashamed that i did so much inner healing just to come home and crack  realizing all my adult and childhood emotional needs have been neglected  because of my reaction  my parents are now offering to pay for therapy but at the same time my dad is saying that i’m making things up  i’m trying to make myself sick  and it’s not his problem bc i’m an adult now and my  also emotionally neglected  siblings aren’t having the same issues  though i will take their help with therapy i feel like there’s no way i can operate around them because they won’t admit to neglecting me and even now  the solutions are very shallow  i want to be in their lives but i know they will continue to disregard me emotionally and it’s so painful  i forgive them for how they are yet i’m completely blamed for my feelings that stem from childhood  because of my spirituality  i know   i can become the adult i want to be and am actively working towards it despite my past     i just truly don’t know how to move forward within this family and help them understand me from the lenses of undiagnosed mental disorders that should’ve been evaluated when i was a child  i am getting psychiatric testing next week   at this point everyone is turning against me and becoming even more unwilling to help as the days pass because they think my emotional reactions are ridiculous  which is why i’m trying to get diagnosis so they would be more willing to hear me  my inner child is broken and i’m healing her and my stability issues but it’s hard when i’m considered to be at fault for things well beyond my control  all i want is for my parents to hear me with understanding so we can move forward and heal together but instead i’m being treated as the insane black sheep of the family even though i’m actively seeking help and want to grow past my codependency issues  i’m happy by myself and with my friends who love me despite my flaws so i know i can be okay without having my family in my life considering the shallow care and support they show hurts me almost every time i see them  overall  honestly  does this sound like a lost cause that i need to move forward from alone  and if not  what more can i do,4381,821
1161,p8z3ca,0,2,Breakups are already hard enough  Allow me to take you back to the crisp days of Winter    I was a teenager  the boy I dated for  years and gave my virginity to cheated on me  For months and months afterward he gaslit me about it  until I actually apologized for being crazy  That year I got to stay an extra week with my Nana after a family vacation  I had so much self esteem pumped into me during that visit that I was finally able to break up with him Such hell was waiting for me when I got home That rat fucking bastard told my parents I was mean to him when I left him  and even told them that we had been fucking  They hid that they knew until I got back so they could ambush me  First it was lectures about how unacceptable it was to be mean to him  How they never ‘taught me to behave like that ’ Then we moved on into the lectures about how ashamed they were of me and how now they needed to ‘get me tested for stds and pregnancy’  lol never fucking happened  they never cared about my body  just shaming me  Over the next months my parents kept driving him to church with us  and having him over to the house without ever checking to see if I was okay with it  When I expressed to my dad how uncomfortable that made me  he decided to tell me how hard the breakup was ON HIM because it reminded him of his parents divorce  Very appropriate guilt to lay on the doorstep of your self harming teenage daughter They remained close to him well after they kicked me out  only keeping their distance after it became apparent he was emotionally abusing the teenager he married in his s I just don’t get how someone could do that to their own daughter  My dad had this fantasy that on my first date he would greet my partner while cleaning his gun  When I was a kid I thought I meant he wanted to show the boy that I was protected and cared about  now I know it was more about making my father feel like the cop he never was,1946,375
1162,p8yy8a,0,2,I recently remembered a childhood acquaintance who had extremely oppressive Nparents  and he was possibly on the road to psychopathy because of them  When I was in elementary school  I was friendly  but not super close with  an ostensibly kind of unstable kid  Lets call him James  James frequently argued with teachers  got into fights  both in school and during extracurricular activities  would throw sports equipment and storm out of the gym if he was on the losing side of a game in PE class  His longest streak of not getting sent to the principals office for something was only  weeks  if I remember right  The dude could not manage his feelings whatsoever Well  if you saw the inner workings of the household James came from  it would not be difficult to figure out why  His parents were blatantly  overtly over controlling of him   of the time  They didnt even give the shits necessary to put on a mask for guests  One of his younger sibling had broken a toy of his that he was never given a replacement for  on the grounds of some kind of group punishment  They refused to help him with homework  He wasnt allowed to show emotion of any kind  One time  I was over at his house  and we werent allowed to go inside for anything other than to use the bathroom  because his parents determined that he had spent enough time playing inside already for the day  Thats all I did get to see  cant imagine what else he was subjected to behind closed doors By the time middle school started  we split paths  I stayed in public  and James parents enrolled him at a private school  because they sincerely believed that his bad behavior was the product of negative influences from other students  even though no one else in school had a record anywhere near as decorated  if you will  as his was  I never saw him in person again  but there were frequent rumors from other graduates of my elementary school about what trouble James got into in any given week  mostly more fights  There wasnt proof of any of it  and Id kind of moved on  so I didnt think much of it  Then high school rolled around  and I caught news of James that I could not ignore Middle of my freshman year of high school  the word on the street was that James had been caught attempting murder  This wasnt just hearsay  there were local news headlines corroborating it  He had a kitchen knife in his possession at school  and was very close to using it on one of his peers  only being stopped by several other students tackling him  Apparently  the almost victims family dropped charges  Whether a correctional institution actually would have fixed this guys temperament is anyones guess  A quick glance through his Facebook profile told me that he now works as a middle school teacher  and either is in deep denial about  or doesnt remember how awful his rearing was  several posts saying how his parents are the greatest ever can be found   May god have mercy on his pupils Just makes me that much more grateful to have this community and other tools to stay self aware and avoid emulating my parents,3096,544
1163,p8ytnj,0,7,I had a breakthrough in therapy today about my parents at  years old  Yup   I just had my first breakthrough in therapy at  years old  I have abandonment issues I never thought I did  because my mom is verbally overbearing  She has called me her best friend  freaks out over potential illness  shes a  healer  by trade   is constantly looking for sympathy etc  but at many key junctions throughout my life  she physically wasnt there For example   and probably the most impactful  when I was   I moved to live in a commune  with my mom     except she never came too  For two years  I thought I was living my best life as a self sufficient  year old without oversight or punishment  but really   I was pretty alone  Did I want to do it at the time  Yeah  But   I was   Without parents  She never took responsibility until way later in my life  when shed call me crying about how sad she is about everything  and I was confused about it until now I lived in a house by myself on  acres with multiple groups of people that all took care of the property  did weird shit like hosted drum circles  grew and sold pot  and ate communal style  I walked to the bus to go to school  and my dad would drive two hours or so for school meetings every once in awhile  I could go whole days at a time without seeing an adult though  and was able to freely go and do what I wanted   which  for the most part  meant I wandered into the forest and hung out with animals 😂I think this fear of abandonment has played into a lot of things in my life  Ive become overly stable in adulthood just trying to find footing  I also constantly feel like a burden  Im not sure of myself  I feel the need to  buy  peoples love  I feel genuinely better alone  Doing crafts or creating things  Not with people  Anyway  not looking for solutions here  just venting what has been weighing on me lately to the group that probably gets it the most  😭,1941,355
1164,p8yt42,0,11,My mother trying to weasel her way back after telling me to never talk to her again after a fight that resulted from her being more  important  I  f  havent talked to my mom in  weeks since I got back from being out of state for the death of my father  She picked a fight about her feelings being more important than the death of my dad  The fight got pretty heated and my teenage son intervened  which pissed his grandmother off even more  After getting after my son to drop it and get in the car  she told me to never talk or see her again  Well  we have been friends on facebook since facebook was around and I thought of unfriending her  but that would make the situation worse  so Ive just ignored her on facebook  But Last night she tagged me and  other women in a recent picture she took with my cat when she was taking care of my cat while I was out of state when my dad was dying   I ignored the post but cant help but feel that shes using this as a tactic to try to get my attention to talk to her I have too much stress right now to deal with my moms pettiness and as of yesterday Im on a holter monitor for  weeks because Ive been having heart problems for a year  with abnormal ECGs  and have to take a stress test and echo cardiogram next week  My teenager is starting school next week and I fear he will get covid or well both get covid and Ill die because of whatever heart issue I have   So I have a lot of anxiety and dont know how Im supposed to process it all  The grief from losing my dad is proving to be more difficult than I ever imagined grief would feel like I did add my mom to the restricted list so she cant view any posts unless theyre public and most recently  changed all past posts to friends only so she cant view anything on my profile  I dont want to punish her  but Im tired of this tactic she uses on me and my son because shes angry she didnt get her way,1925,379
1165,p8yng0,0,4,My nmom had an injury and I dont feel sad Am I a bad daughter  Hello My mom recently had an injury where she was hospitalized  fortunately the injury didnt leave her immobile etc she just needs a bed rest for a few weeks until she can walk normally again  My dad is mostly helping her during recovery but of course I help too But still  if there was someone else who saw their parent get hospitalized after a very bloody injury they would be horrified feel so sad and act very compassionate towards them I don’t feel sadder than I would if I saw the same thing happen to one of my classmates a person I saw an the street  It is probably because there is so little emotional bond between us I feel like I’m a very bad person because even though she traumatized me I believe she really loves me she just grew up like this and doesnt actually know how to act better  She thinks she did her best raising me and she was a good mom But everyone in my family thinks she has a mental illness and should get treatment but she insists nothing is wrong with her She is a perfect mom We are just ungrateful kids  husband  I still feel like I’m a bad daughter and I should be ashamed  Who sees their mom almost lose a limb and not feel sad,1232,224

1168,p8ygcw,0,8,Need advice for silent treatment So earlier this week  my family helped me move in to med school  I was so excited and this was a dream Ive been looking forward to for all my life  My family was happy for me as well  As we were driving around  I noticed a pizza place next to my apartment  I got excited because I love pizza and was  jokingly  talking about how I was going to eat there every day  What happened next was that my mom went  youre going to look like a pig  in a tone that felt a little mean to me  That was really triggering for me  I have been feeling very uncomfortable with my body lately because Ive gained weight  and she loves to point it out  I was so happy in that moment  having moved in and ready to start my new life  and her words just ruined the mood  I was really hurt and I calmly said  hey mom can you please not compare me to a pig   She then got really defensive and said she didnt mean it  and that she didnt know it was bad to compare people to pigs  such a lie   I didnt want a confrontation so I just said  okay fine you didnt mean it  but I was fighting back tears because I was hurt  She then got really mad at me and she hasnt talked to me in a week  Her demeanor immediately became icy and cold  She is essentially waiting for me to reach out and apologize  but I have nothing to apologize for  Generally  I dont really reach out to her  due to our countless fights and the harm she has caused to me in the past  I feel like I cant talk about anything without starting a fight  So Ive pretty much backed off and she is the one that usually reaches out to me  The fact that she hasnt said anything shows me that she is giving me the silent treatment  but I know that if I mention it to her  shell flip it around and tell me that Im giving her the silent treatment instead  Im also bummed because I just wanted these weeks to be good between us because I have achieved a goal that I have literally poured every inch of my soul into  Does anyone have advice about how you would approach this situation,2059,404
1169,p8y8w1,0,4,I can’t stop constantly over apologizing and I’m afraid no one will want to be around me eventually Tl dr  I apologize way too much and everyone around me is telling me to stop  After reading a bunch of articles online I realize how negatively it effects others and how it is manipulative and self involved  and a way to manage anxiety  How can I stop constantly over apologizing  I feel horrible for putting others in the position of reassuring me  I’ve read every article I can find online about the phenomenon and I’ve tried all sort of tricks  like replacing sorry with “thank you ” but nothing seems to be working — I keep automatically saying sorry before I even realize I’ve said it When I think about apologizing less it fills me with terror  like letting go of a security blanket  I don’t know how else to manage all the stupid excess fear and anxiety and guilt  I constantly feel like I’m “in trouble” or might be Just saying thank you and not apologizing  which I know I should do  is so painful and hard for me  Talk about first world problems  What can I do instead when the guilt and fear and desire to apologize is so strong and overwhelming  but I haven’t actually done anything wrong,1210,214

1171,p8y2kg,0,2,Emotional  physical and mental abuse Since I was about  I slowly started to realize how abusive my father is and how complacent my mother is  He controls every task she does and all his of needs are met first  only his opinion matters  and if you don’t agree  prepare yourself  Once when I was on video chat with my friend and my dad was verbally abusing me  without realizing she was listening and watching  he gave me a bloody nose and busted lip  She called the police and when they showed up to my house both of my parents were distraught that I called them  The police looked at my house  looked at all the materialistic items we had and told me to be grateful I had a family like the one the saw in those ten minutes  And they left  I had no phone  internet or television for  months  I only had myself and a journal  I was so disassociated for those months  My mother never came to check on me  I was only allowed to stay in my room and go out to eat when everyone else was done  This all happened when I was   Now at   finishing school soon  I have never felt more desperate to leave and never look back  I’m trying to take advantage as much as I can that I can stay here for free and just do my best in school but part of me just wants to drop out and move far away and never speak to them again  I walk around this house with my heart in my throat and biting my tongue until it bleeds  I’m embarrassed when my dad has his outbursts towards me in front of my partner  He is a toxic patriarch and no one can stop him and no one can help me except for myself  I have many stories and instances of abuse that I can recall and I’ve always wanted to write a blog or journal about them and how I “coped”  I think writing them out will be the closest thing to therapy for me  At least for now,1810,359
1172,p8xysq,0,2,Being raised by Indian parents Since I was  they have constantly belittled me  bully me  abuse me physically and verbally  blame me for their mistakes  When I was a kid I wasn’t treated like a kid  I was treated like a college student  always being told to study constantly which would make me unhappy because my cousins and friends would be playing and I’d be here studying for no reason  I was in grade   That shit doesn’t even matter  I was always compared to my cousins and other people’s kids  Instead of being proud of me when I got really good grades on tests and exams they would briefly appraise it but then suddenly compare me to another kid they know and tell me that he got better marks than you  This would make me feel like shit and worthless Everything was my fault  Helping dad fix something and can’t do something right because I don’t know to use a tool  My fault  Lost something valuable to them  My fault  Can’t do something perfectly while I’m learning  My fault  On top of all that  I was the punching bag  the scapegoat of my friend group  Because of this I started to develop anxiety and major depression  I would avoid social gatherings because I was afraid of being judged and bullied  I would sleep for hours  be unmotivated  wouldn’t help anyone because I was always tired  When I got to college I developed OCD and it would highly impact my life and daily tasks  When I confronted my parents about this in  they said I was lying  that I was making excuses  that it’s all in my head  I’ve been put on antidepressants and antipsychotics ever since They keep urging me to stop taking my meds because “it’s bad for me” when they are the only thing that keeps me sane  If I miss a dose or stop taking them it makes me very depressed againMy first suicide attempt was in December of  because of the immense pressure my parents were putting on me to finish school  Since then  they have guilt tripped me and still refuse to believe my mental health disorders  They keep making excuses that it’s all in my head  that only I have control over it  and them being extremely religious  which is the main cause of my OCD  always tell me to believe in god and all of this will go away  blah blah blah  Since December  I have attempted  more times and have been admitted to psych wards  Don’t get me wrong  they said they care about me and to never attempt again and to be open with them  So when I told them everything that they were the cause of my mental disorders  they of course  told me that they were saints while raising me as a kid while refusing to acknowledge the toxic traits and behaviours they acted out against me  Anyways I have nobody to blame except my parents and toxic friends I have had to deal with for all of my mental disorders  It just sucks that the people you put your trust in refuse to believe your mental health and think of you as an investment rather than their kid,2942,543
1173,p8xxsq,0,3,My little brother is narcissistic and very secretive Out of my other narcissistic family members this worries me most  Basically  Im not too much older than my younger bro and since we were little Ive tried to involve him in things I would do  When we moved to a different country and he came into my school in later years I would take him with me to school everyday and try to talk with him when he was in his awkward antisocial phase  unlike my older brother that essentially used to ignore me in boarding school cuz I guess he didnt want to be associated with his lil bro   because I know how it felt When I left to go to uni in London I would take him with me to concerts and he’d stay at mine  However  now that he is at uni and has a good friendship group he’s started looking down on me and I think this is also because of my place in the family  We haven’t argued or anything like that  I dont have the strength to do so with any of my family members anymore especially after a lifelong cucle of abuse  But  he goes out of his way to disrespect me even when it is not neccessary  I fell out with my friendship group before graduation  so Ive spent this summer by myself for the most part and he doesnt even attempt to gist me about where he goes etc  Another example is he recently started a new account on Facebook and followed everyone in my family except from me and then when I was talking about fb around him he immediately changed his behaviour This reslly feels like a last straw because my other siblings and my mum are really toxic  And Ive honestly given up on human relationships to be honest  Normal me is really friendly and outgoing but the way my siblings especially have treated me during a difficult period in my life  when I supported them when they had theyre own  is very eye opening to me   Im planning to take a year out from my masters and go abroad but I havent told any of my family yet because honestly I dont feel like they have my best interest at heart  like at all  My mum goes out of her way to instill shame in me  everything with my sister is always all about her  my brother is just selfish idk if it has anything to do with being the oldest son and now my younger brother is very fake to my face  Lately Ive realised that in my family  noone wants a genuine connection with me or each other and have resorted to use competition as a substitute to communication Just posting this as I would like some advice on how to proceed with the situation  as Ive been very calm even when provoked and mostly stay on my own now but I cant see that lasting in the future,2608,501

1183,p8wtdt,0,4,Long story  but somewhat wholesome if you have the time to read I have a lot of memories from childhood that I locked away  I felt a lot of shame for who I was at just  year old  But even with my limited vocabulary at that age  I would tell my abusers that they were being mean to me  It was a word I learned in school about bullies  the irony   I would openly confront their behavior as mean  Because I was taught in school that you stand up to bullies and tell them what they’re doing is mean and hurtful  That it’s supposed to take their power away if you bravely confront them with the truth  Imagine a  year old me  fearlessly calling out her abusers with all that conviction  bravery and anger  I wish I had that courage now lol  Sometimes I imagine the girl I would’ve been if they didn’t take the time to break my spirit  Once upon a time  I was brave  And I learned how to be brave As usual  they turned it against me  Anytime I confronted them  they would mock or punish me for it  “Always the same word  mean  Maybe you’re the mean one for saying it  Why do you say it like that  If you say mean one more time  Here we go again  calling us mean  That’s the only word she knows ”  Even as a write this I feel that old guilt for likening my parents with school bullies  How dare I  So ungrateful  But they were much worse than any bully  It was easier to believe because all three of them would laugh and gang up on me  Gone was the brave little  year old  But I like to think of her fondly  She knew she was outnumbered and it didn’t scare her to try anyways  I can still remember her anger and the way she prepared to confront them  Big scowl on her face  hands on her hip  chest puffed out for good measure  standing in the middle of the kitchen  all of some  and   feet tall  choosing to forget the fear she felt  and loudly saying  “Hey  You’re being mean ” She knew how to set boundaries and she knew the standard of treatment she deserved  She’s my hero  And I would’ve forgotten about her if that memory didn’t unlock this morning  The look on their face was priceless before they attacked her  Yea  she’s my hero,2157,414
1184,p8wsb6,0,2,Is enmeshment always narcissm  Men who have been enmeshed by their mothers  would you say this is always narcissm or can a toxic environment lead to it Personally my mother lost her first her husband  my father  and developed a drinking problem and very few boundaries especially with me growing up and would vent to me about her new husband and even share intimate details and issues  she was also very controlling and over protective of me  Usually this would happen when she would binge drink by herself on the weekends in the living room and wanted company  She would also be very volatile and would be constantly angry cleaning and raging  Would verbally berate me and call me things like useless idiot etc when I would make mistakes or do something that made her mad  She sometimes hit me with whatever she had close by like a broom stick or would pull my hair and I would hear my scalp pop It seems she would be nicer to me when she was mad at her husband and meaner to me when she was good with him  Sometimes it was a weird dynamic where she would defend me a lot from the step dad and wouldnt let him try to  discipline  me  Mind you I never disrespected him even though he always had a disrespectful vibe towards me and jealousy from the enmeshment  I was also asked to help parent my siblings to compensate for what she felt were her husbands short comings in that aspect Ive moved out after step dad disrespected me and my gf after he was caught on a dating app talking to women in other countries  Im confused because Mom has her good moments and seems to have empathy towards me and others and apologized for her past behaviors when I told her how I feel about it  However she can be very irrational and has a hard time even understanding the concept of boundaries without getting offended if I set one  My younger half siblings also have a hard time understanding boundaries  Whenever I have to set a boundary to a toxic behavior from any of them they all get offended and start to attack me as one  They are not happy that I do not visit them at home because step dad apologized to me for what he did  All I ask of them as that we spend time in a neutral place,2188,407

1189,p8w9r6,0,4,Ugh  I get so sick and tired of most people thinking my Nmom is a good mom This is the pure result of covert narcissism  Whenever I am with my mom in public she hides her narcissism well   I mean there are some subtle narcissism there but for the most part she hides it   I get so sick of most people in my life commenting that she does amazing things for me  Sure  she lovebombs by giving me so many materialistic things  however  no amount of stuff with cancel out the verbal and psychological damage and abuse she has done to me and my brothers growing up   If only they knew how much she yells at me and makes me the bad guy  If only they knew the horrible shit she says and does to me behind close doors  And this is how coverts are smart  they know that this will make it very hard for everyone to believe me  I do have some people in my life who believe me  And  they are amazing people who I keep close   But for the most part  no one will believe me  I hate how clever narcs are,988,198

1191,p8vur5,0,6,Getting out of an abusive household  Hi all I posted this in r justnofamily as well but thought I would cross post here since it seems relevant  Sorry in advance for the long post but I am looking for advice from any of you who have broken away from abusive family situations at an older age I am a  year old still living in my abusive parents home  The abuse is not physical nor has it ever been  but it is tumultuous and is very ingrained in me as I have lived in this situation for virtually my entire life  I have a decent enough job  a bachelors degree in accounting  and am moving on to obtain my masters degree this next year My mother is an opioid addict and a narcissist and my father is an enabler and has been a participant in the verbal and emotional abuse just as much as my mother  They have stolen thousands and thousands of dollars from me  on top of the rent that they charged me every month  Before I was really privy to what they were doing  I had a joint checking account with them which enabled them to take as much money from me as they wished  I was able to get my own bank account and transfer the funds I had left  which caused a horrific situation for me at home  In the past when I have challenged my mother on anything  she has threatened me  She has told me she would call the cops and have me removed from the household  that my things would be on the front lawn when I got home from work  or that the locks would be changed and I would be unable to get back in the home and if I attempted to get in I would be legally charged with breaking and entering  She has gotten herself into a fair bit of trouble with her opioid addiction and has dragged me and my siblings into it more times than I can count  We found her unresponsive on the toilet one night  called   and after she came to and the paramedics told her they strongly recommend going into the hospital  she made my ten year old sister sleep in her bed to make sure she kept breathing through the night She is a pathological liar  a horrifically gifted manipulator  and is all about keeping up appearances  Her spending plunged her and my dad into bankruptcy several times  When I was  years old  the first time my sister and I reached out to our extended family for help  we found out that my parents had also stolen upwards of   from our familys trust  which provided   to us each birthday and Christmas  every single check went into funding my mothers drug and shopping addiction  My parents have belittled me and told me I was worthless my entire life  They called me greedy and useless when I would ask about the money they stole and would tell me I was a loser for still living in my parents home at such an old age  Long story short  they have done some terrible things and the abuse has always remained hidden  I was a high achieving student as was my sister  and no one suspected a thing because we never told anyone anything  from the outside  we looked like a pretty perfect family  The scary thing is I thought we were too until the abuse became more apparent and my moms drug addiction became glaringly obvious  When I tried to reach out to some people who knew the family  they told my mom and my mom told them I was clinically insane and was seeking treatment  The gaslighting and roller coaster of emotion has honestly made me feel like I was insane  One day the world is falling apart and the next  everything is fine  If I ever so much as brought up a traumatic event  both my mother and father would say   what do you mean   or   youre crazy  get some help   Despite my mothers constant immoral behavior  she has never seen real consequences because she can talk herself out of virtually anything  and everyone believes her sick  twisted stories  I even catch myself believing them sometimes and even feeling bad for her After reaching out for help years ago  my younger sister was able to find other  less abusive accommodations  as was I  However  shortly after I had moved out  I went straight back  I have been there ever since  stewing in a silent kind of misery  I have developed many mental issues and unhealthy coping mechanisms to survive  Every day is a massive struggle for me  I harbor extreme amounts of self hatred  and I am afraid to leave my parents house because I am nearly certain I will crash and burn  On a logical level  I understand that these feelings are a symptom of abuse  Knowing this does not change the paralyzing fear I feel to step outside of the abusive situation  Honestly  I feel very hopeless  trapped  and drained to even tackle adulthood as it is now  thinking about escaping this situation and healing from it seems like an insurmountable challenge  I do not want to live this way anymore  but I dont even know where to start,4810,880

good heart he was irreponsible and bad with money When i was  years old i witnessed and stopped your first suicide attempt My life as a kid was bad Surronded by gangs i tried my best I didnt join them I got beat up because of it  i was beaten almost every single day anyways so more pain did very little for me Someone saw me get beaten by a mob and told you i was in a gang and that was an iniciation Thats a lie  the only male rolemodel i had my dear grandpa who was sick his whole life but did his best   I couldnt do this to him joining a gang When i was out of highschool i started working and living life trying my best Dad was in debt grandpa payed all Soon grandpa died Before he died i promised him to take care of the family We almost lost the house he left us dad tried hard and i did my best We saved it I was working in a slave labour job with barely any money i didnt quit i did my best Dads health suffered because of an accident and i needed the work no matter how bad it was   I worked if needed  h almost without pay Then my mentally challenged uncle whos his hard of earing almost went blind I quit my job to take care of him   Then dad had a spinal infection leaving him paralyzed   I yelled in the middle of the night WHY HAS GOD FORSAKEN ME No reply  Only tears I went to church i did my best Everyday i cooked  I made sure dad had his treatment so did uncle I went everymonth for his shot bought his meds went to the hospital with him Docs said dad would die  I broke down my church pastor gave me the only confort i ever received I did my best Along the day dad was receving money from unemployement and you refused to pay for his treatment So i used his money for that Never took a penny for me even tho you did One day i cant draw money from the ATM from your bank account mom and uncles You accused me of stealing your pension   I left the house Nothing on me but my wallet my bible  bucks and the keys to a home i didnt know id be able to comeback to I returned home for something that i think was one of my books I managed to convince you to go to the bank with me by taking a ride from my friend from church Dad has a credit card The debts were old I never stole anything you didnt care tho After we leave the bank family friend who we trusted deleted passwords for entire family for Social Security and Finances   I recovered them Dad transfered to a rehab facility he recovered thanks to a miracle from god and alot of good will   You keep saying horrible things   When i told you i was sexually assaulted you didnt care   Still i kept going When a doctor risked her job to assure my uncle had his surgery i did my best I had to quit the queue and had no papers to prove it if i left I trusted the doctor and in gods will She operated regardless of no papers at the time before the surgery   Uncle could finally see a tiny bit from one eye I was happy The same doctor you badmouthed complaining about the price of the medicine my uncle takes while you have plenty to purchase it   You no longer have debts I took care of it Dad is walking and alive I managed to get him a retirement pension and a supplement for his disability And now im disposable    I do not know where things will go now I will likely have no place to comeback to But i kept my promise old man i took care of them Im tired All i wanted was love and a peaceful life I never wanted your money nor anything you think i did Just peace love and to be normal Im so tired Why couldnt you love me Why What did i do At the age of  or  was my first attempt at ending my life I was saved by an old man I wish i could remember his face Life is filled with pain I have tried Loving you Caring for you Solving your problems It is never enough You always bad mouth everyone and accused me of things i never did Soon im going away almost no money to a new place without anything planned Im leaving this here because i will be without internet for a while when i move I said i didnt care what happened after i kept my promise to my dead grandpa I meant it but i had hope our hearts could reach one another   It didnt happen Im so tired I never cared for money drugs booze going out late I just wanted some peace Either way this will end now The fire is fading the tears are flowing I cant anymore I will try to make a life far away but im so tired When i tried to reach for mental help The doctor laughed in my face I left never to comeback Im so tired If you are a parent reading this please dont let the sins of your life be the burden of your child Life as it is now for me im not sure

1194,p8vs3a,0,26,Told NMom I was on the fence about having kids and she unleashed some crazy rage on me Has this happened to any of you guys  Before I went NC  I foolishly confided in my NMom that the state of the world made me question the decision to start a family  It set her off in a way that was a little scary  anger and insults escalated real fast  that I did not see coming  In between lambasting me for letting climate change political direction of the country factor into my choice “don’t tell anyone you think this way they will make fun of you for being a complete idiot ”  she said that nobody would have stood in her way of becoming a mom  I guess it was rude of me to consider the world my children would inherit as part of my decision to have a family  Or I owe her grandchildren  Lol news to me I’m still trying to wrap my head around what would have triggered this sort of completely disproportionate response from her  It bothers me from time to time,960,182

1213,p8sr5u,0,2,I don’t know what emotions I should feel about my childhood  Sorry if this doesn’t fit in this subreddit right  I just couldn’t find anywhere to ask this except accidentally stumbling into here  I’m turning  soon and I’ve just started to question some of my emotions to things in my childhood  My parents marriage is basically broken  The only reason they’re still together right now is because of financial reasons  I only started talking to my dad at age  because I for some reason hated him which I can’t remember why but my brother still doesn’t talk to him  Even though we live in the same house and I’m just questioning why my mom wouldn’t try to fix bring our family to counseling  My dad has a lot of problems tho  he is abusive verbally and sometimes abuses animals aswell when hes angry  He had a really bad childhood and his parents never took care of him but I know he still loves me apart from the other things  The only reason I ever talk to my dad now is because I put in effort myself to try to  I have a memory that I tried talking to him when I was really young  probably around  and my Mom basically was jealous in a way and said “You can stay with your father then” or something similar and then I started crying to my mom and then stopped talking to my dad after that until I was  again  My brother is basically really damaged now  Hes  and still has a really bad relationship with my dad and they don’t talk at all  I don’t think my mom is ”narcissistic”  reason I was confused if I should post here but it says “Significant others and friends are all welcome”   I think shes just really immature and tried to keep us to herself instead of our dad but its damaged my family alot  But the main reason I’m talking here is because I don’t really feel emotional about this  I think I’m just accustomed to it now  I’ll probably just move on with my life after this post  I know its not how I should’ve been raised but I’m only curious not sad about it  I feel like I should feel more  Help,2014,385
1214,p8sqw9,0,6,Fuckin Jim    Im so glad I found this group  I had the misfortune of being raised by two awful  abusive  selfish people and reading all of your posts makes me feel less alone  I put a trigger warning on this because Im sure reading this might bring up some feelings for some of you who have experienced something similar My nmadre deserves a post of her own  but this post is about my nfather  Fucking Jim  My nfather is an older parent  Hes  and Im   He has  older daughters from a previous relationship that have gone NC on him  Theyre in their s and s  Im the youngest of his  children that  he is aware of   I dont blame my sisters for going NC on the guy  He tells me all these stories of driving around the NW in a Frito Lay van he had converted into a hippie mobile in his s  His daughters are notably absent from all these stories  but he does mention plenty of girlfriends with young kids that were along for the ride My dad is a bit of a hoarder and he has RVs and sheds all over our  acre property full of antiques and junk thats probably been shat all over by rats and is likely covered in mold  This stuff is the most important thing in the world to him  He was never one to hold a steady job  and usually made money doing odd mechanic jobs out of a shop he built on our land  As a result we were poor and there was always junky stuff all over our property  The houses we lived in were always unfinished and most of my life I lived in houses with exposed frames with sheets separating our bedrooms to give us a little privacy My nmadre was physically and verbally abusive and mentally unstable and my father just let her do her thing to me  He also had a horrible temper and wasnt afraid of slapping me to the ground or chasing me around the house with a leather belt  so he wasnt much better  He was also a creepy pervert who was always making lewd comments about teenage girls we went to school with to my older brother  whos obviously gay  but my nfather is in denial about it   So I never felt comfortable having girlfriends over because my house and property was a wreck  my mother was an abusive  mentally unstable latina who never cared to learn English after  plus years in the US  and my father was a disgusting creepy pervert My dad is now retired and living off social security  The only person my dad treats very well is my favorite Uncle and only decent relative  My Uncle is fairly well off and is always buying my dad everything he needs and giving him money  My dad is only kind to his dog and people he knows he can get something out of  Uncle lives in California and we are in Texas  In  I was laid off from my job which paid really well  I was totally freaking out because Im the breadwinner of my family unit and there was no way I would be able to pay mortgage and bills without a job  I totally downsized my life and my father convinced me to buy this house out in the country that we used to live in before my nmadre won it from my nfather in divorce court  took off to live in Mexico  and left it abandoned for  years  The house sits on an acre and all the land around it is owned by my nfather  My nfather built a very small one bedroom cabin about  yards away from the old house   I was hesitant to purchase a house that was owned by a parent I had NC with   I have had NC with my egg donor for over  years   thats a stones throw away from my nfather  but I was desperate and the place had well water and I could afford to buy it outright with my savings  The house is huge too and about half of the house is in pretty decent shape  This would allow me to live somewhere with no rent and water bill so I could afford to go back to school to get a new job  My nfather was so excited  He promised he would help us with repairs   remember  the place had been vacant out in the country for  years   He even promised he would gift me the acre between my house and the road so I wouldnt be landlocked by his property  So I reached out to a family member that was still contact with my nmadre to be the mediator for our transaction and pulled the trigger  Its been a year now and all is not well  My nfather hasnt done much to help us with the house  and what he has done Ive had to pay him for  On top of that  hes verbally accosted and guilt tripped me into handing over about   worth of my money   I mentioned Im unemployed  right   He immediately forgot his promise to sign over the acre between our house and the road so now we are landlocked by his property and are forced to use his driveway which he says we are  destroying   I drive a fucking subaru crosstrek  its not damaging shit   if anything his awful driveway is damaging my car  He has allowed the land surrounding the one acre I own to grow up head high all around us and doesnt give us the option to tend to it  I have a  year old boy and two small dogs so I live in fear of snakes and coyotes attacking them from the tall grass and brush  He doesnt care  A few months ago he decided to pick a huge fight with me because I decided to give away a minifridge of mine that my dad stowed away into one of his many storage sheds on the property after deciding it belonged to him  I didnt ask his permission to give it away  because it was mine  and he yelled and screamed and threw stuff at me  I was crying and hyperventilating when I walked out of his cabin to my porch where my boyfriends dad was waiting to take the minifridge to his son  His dad saw I was visibly upset and felt guilty and uncomfortable  I said  between sobs  that it was best if he didnt take the fridge  My nfather was walking over at this point and he claims he overheard me saying to my FIL that they couldnt take the fridge because of my nfather  Of course  this embarrassed my nfather because I guess I made him look bad  and that was basically enough for him to decide that he hates me and never wants to talk to me again  This has really done a number to my mental health because now I KNOW that worthless junk is more important to my nfather than I am Now I live  yards away from my nfather in a house thats completely surrounded by land he owns thats overgrown and covered in junk that he cares about more than he cares about me  He ignores me every time he sees me  which is everyday  He only texts me to demand things from me or complain about how my boyfriend  child and I are doing something wrong  I live with crippling depression and anxiety due to the verbal and physical abuse inflicted upon me my entire life by my narcissistic parents and now Im stuck living next to one whos goal is to make us as miserable as he is  I have been dealing with suicidal ideation since I was a teenager  and its particularly bad right now  Ive been reading lots of books about toxic parents and reading a lot of posts on this group  which really help me feel less alone If youve read this far  thank you  I honestly dont even mind if Im talking into a void because it just feel good to put this out into the world  I guess I just feel awfully depressed and unloved  I keep struggling with this sense of hopelessness and guilt for bringing my boyfriend and his perfectly nice  normal family into my web of family drama bullshit  Im scared they will see that I am damaged and unlovable and convince him to find someone with a better family  Holy shit  Please tell me Im not alone,7453,1442
1215,p8snsd,0,9,it hurts when they took money from you that could never be returned  nparents will play all kinds of mind games so that they will never have to return that money  i had a very dear family member who left me some money but my ndad pressured me as a minor to give it to him because we were becoming bankrupt  financial problems that could be avoided and is totally his fault   the family member passed away recently and i miss him a lot  i know that money he gave me can never come back  my nparents are masters of playing all kinds of tricks to never give me back my money  too bad were also low income so paying me back is the least of their priorities  they havent returned me money that they borrowed multiple times  i stopped asking for it because i asked for it for months and there was no action on my n dads part  its so much money that they took from me   i dont really want advice  but stories and comforting words are welcome,939,179

1217,p8skx3,0,2,It is the little things that you never notice So the really severe elements of my childhood trauma started at birth and ran through about  years old  We were given the typical  you have a great life   speeches and one of the points always was that  we had the bigger room in the house   not the primary bedroom  but a room larger than the other two available  We never made that decision  it was made when we were like   we were originally in one of the smaller bedrooms and the grandmother was in the bigger one Eventually  we escape to the military and end up in Iraq  far from the N More time passes and we marry our high school sweetheart and end up back in Iraq  At this time the N is contacting my wife  telling her she should be ashamed that she was living in an apartment with the air conditioner running  in Texas in the summer  because I was deployed overseas This is now over a decade in the past  but as we have been talking about childhood  our wife brought up an interesting point where she kept mentioning a fan that would always run  but did nothing in the room  We didnt remember so asked for clarification  where she said that it was so hot in the room and the fan didnt help  No memory of it being hot  so asked how hot it was  she said it was the same as the ambient temperature  the same as walking into the garage And then it clicked  the reason the grandmother was moved out of the room was that either the AC was disconnected there or it simply couldnt reach the room  So we grew up with no heat   air for at least  years and became so numb to it that it didnt register  But the icing for the N side is the phone call to my wife saying she had the air conditioner running  when we literally found  some  better living conditions in a tent in the Middle East,1801,343

1225,p8rr58,0,6,I’m tired of life  No I won’t do anything stupid  I still believe It will get better if I try hard enough  But the fact that I didn’t have a wonderful childhood I can look back to whenever I deal with disappointments  or a great family I can go to whenever I feel someone to talk to is a little upsetting  I wished things were different  being treated as a scapegoat and black sheep because of Narcs also heavily impacted my life  Like yesterday I had my second drivers licence lesson  I passed for the theory and the drivers instructor said that I drive very good I just need to remain calm and maybe do meditation or drink a tea that keeps you calm because I cling onto the steering wheel and he’s unable to correct it when I’m driving  That’s the only thing I need to work on but still I feel like a complete dumbass who can’t do anything right  Because of the variants most ppl are forced to work from home except hospitals I was thinking about doing something online or learn an instrument like the Ukelele or violin and do Busking for a living  until I get my degree at University  But even with that I feel like I’ll fail because all my life I’ve heard from Narcs that I’ll never be great  I also heard that maybe I should become a parent  but I had to raise myself  all the thing I know is because I watched tv read books and take notes from other parents who had successful children  so that’s not a good idea  But then again I don’t want to prove those Narcs right,1481,282
1226,p8repi,0,2,Seeing the unfair treatment even after NC A long time ago I ruined my last year in high school  I was not doing well mentally and had been struggling a lot with my parents for the last years of high school  My parents were always fighting with my school and at some point even tried suing them   My parents lost   My grades in the middle of this emotional battlefield were not good enough and I had to redo my year  Luckily there is this instance where you can repeat only the subjects you failed  instead of redoing everything  I went there to then get my high school diploma  It was a city away  so I had to take the train  It was about  euros to go back and forth  In total it must have costed  euro to even go to school  My parents told me I had to pay it  I had a part time job and as of their reasoning   YOU are the one who made a mess out of everything  So YOU can deal with the consequences     euro is a lot as an  year old  But I managed  only to hear them say  You wouldnt have made it without us  Now my younger sister is going trough the same thing  The difference is that she is dropping out  years before the end of high school  So she will have to go by train for  or maybe even  years  I reached out to my sister to check up on her   I am in NC with my parents  but she is still living at home   Maybe I could help her out financially  or try to help her find ways to cut some costs  like season tickets or other things I had never known about during my time  Turns out that she is getting everything paid for  Dont get me wrong  Im happy for her as it decreases her stress a lot  And I did expect this a little because my sisters have always been treated differently to me  But it did stung  My parents reasoning was that my sisters autism was the cause of her dropping out of high school  The school didnt provide enough help for her  The school never understood my sister like my parents have  So now she is getting everything paid for  On the one hand its making my NC feel more valid  On the other hand it stings so much that I have actively been discriminated at  My parents have always told me Im less than my sisters because Im not autistic and they are   Ive never been tested  I am looking into it more now though  since my GP already noticed some traits and advised me to check for it   My Ndad is autistic and my Nmom certainly has traits of it too  but never got diagnosed  They have told me things as  You will never be as smart as they are    If you passed this course  then its extremely easy for your sister   If you were autistic  maybe then you would have been less emotional and not compare yourself with your sisters so much Are they doing this to save their imagine of autism  Or maybe to show others that they DO care for their children  Maybe they dont want my sister starting a tantrum and this is just the easy solution I stopped caring about my parents wellbeing a long time ago  but sometimes stuff like this will hit you in the face without any warning,3038,590

1229,p8r588,0,2,Nmom threatens me with rejection over food choices  Let me start by saying that I can’t go NC because I’m a caregiver for my disabled brother and I’m super close to my brother and my dad  thus making things very difficult  But here’s what happened last night and I’m sure more will happen today So I invited my mom and brother on a little day trip just  hours away to see a movie in D  you know  where the seats move and stuff  They wanted to go and mom asked me to buy the tickets and said she would reimburse me  I work part time and make very little money right now since that’s just my gig during grad school  Whatever  I’m getting reimbursed so I paid for the tickets and everything was fine Well  everything was fine until mom asked if we would be riding together  I live about  minutes from nmom  I told her I thought we would just meet there thinking that it wouldn’t be that big of a deal  Well  it was  I conceded because whatever  we could take my husband’s car and that’s the least of my concern  but I kept telling my mom that my husband and I wanted to go to a particular place for dinner afterwards that we’ve been wanting to go to for years  That was when all the fit pitching got extreme Nmom doesn’t like where we wanted to eat so she started flipping out and threatening me with rejection if I ever invite her to anything else ever again  Note that every time I usually invite her to a movie I’m willing to drive  minutes out just so she doesn’t have to drive  minutes to the theater near me  so her reaction was basically her way of saying I don’t do anything for her when I bend over backwards to keep the peace  She ended up dragging my dad into things saying only that I refused to ride together  At this point  I had surrendered on that one and it wasn’t an issue  I had to text my dad because she made it sound like he wasn’t taking my side in things  which  when the context is skewed I don’t blame him  so I had to explain the rest of things to him because I don’t want to be seen as the unreasonable one when I literally keep giving in so that my brother doesn’t have to suffer by not going I ended up telling my mom that I was surrendering because I didn’t want to have to deal with her being ridiculous over something stupid and small and then she gaslit me and said she didn’t want to ride with me if I’m going to be sulking the entire way So long story short  I paid a lot of money for a fun outing  mom tried to back out and threaten to not come to anything with me anymore because of a freaking restaurant  and I’m now dreading this day that was supposed to be fun and I genuinely hope my mom backs out  My dad already reimbursed me just in case,2700,523

1235,p8q2cs,0,10,My NMom is convinced our dog is aggressive  when shes not  We have a  year old lab husky mix  For some reason my mom suddenly made it up in her mind that Willow  the dog  is aggressive when shes not  She tenses up when she handles Willow making situations worse  If anything she is reactive on a leash  theres a difference  and I have been trying to teach her out of it  I told my mom her reactivity goes way down if every time she lunges  I stop  Then she gets the idea she cant pull me down the street after a few times  Ive taken her out many times  shes had positive interactions with even cats   theres a local Ma and Pa pet store near me that has some cats free roam the whole store  I remember once I was talking to my cousin and she asked my mom why she never brings Willow on play dates and she told my cousin she was agressive  I told her  Shes not aggressive  she gets way too much in other dogs faces and they dont like that and she takes the correction as a fight  And my mom freaks out way too much  making the situation worse   When I explained that my cousin said  Oh that makes sense  Its worse if one dog is on a leash too and the other is not  Im taking her to the renaissance fair and my mom is convinced Im going to get her sued  She watches too much Judge Judy and follows too many horror story pages on facebook where all they post is dogs getting mauled by others and I think all that negativity made her believe Willow is some dangerous killing machine  We only had one incident years ago when we brought her to a dog park and some idiot decided it was a good idea to have their reactive dog growling and lunging outside of the fence so all the other dogs were like  wtf is that   and she bit our other dog  he ended up being fine and I mostly blame the other owner for causing high tension and bringing a dog that should never be at a dog park  until he got some basic training or she learned to calm down   to the park  My mom is making me take a choker collar  I fucking hate those things  But whatever if it makes her shut up and convinced she wont be sued or end up on a facebook page Ill put it in my bag and only use it if I defiantly have too tl dr   My mom watches way too much Judge Judy and facebook groups where all they post is stories of dogs getting mauled or killed and shes convinced our dog is like that when shes just is reactive on a leash and she doesnt know anything about dog training a reactive dog,2475,488

1240,p8pkv9,0,16,NMom bought international plane tickets without asking me— advice  I just moved overseas to teach English on the other side of the world  It’s my fourth year living abroad  My mom has been asking for a few months about visiting me over Christmas  I‘ve told her repeatedly that I’m not making any plans or promises and will need to settle into my host country  She kept bringing it up  and I kept telling her I didn’t have enough information and wasn’t ready to talk about it  Practically speaking  I don’t even know what my schedule will look like for winter break since I’ll be teaching at a new school  What I didn’t disclose is that I’ll be in a long distance relationship and was planning on meeting him in a neighboring country during that time period  The only way our relationship will work for him is if we see each other regularly  and Christmas break will be the longest amount of time we’d have for each other  Anyways  I just found out through the grapevine that my mom bought tickets for her and my dad to spend Christmas with  me back in May       This was back when the status of my placement was uncertain because of the pandemic  which means she got tickets before my visa and own plane ticket over here were sorted out  She just assumed she was invited I’m angry they booked tickets without coordinating with me first  and stressed because I don’t want to celebrate Christmas with them  During the three years I’ve lived overseas in the past  I only spent one Christmas with them  so it isn’t a “given” for our family I was planning on coming up with an adroit excuse to avoid a nasty argument  Now  it’s going to turn into a confrontation where I’m straight up rejecting the visit they already paid for  and also may face accusations of wasting their money  I’m pretty preoccupied with learning the language and culture  and I don’t want to deal with this  And yet  I know the confrontation is coming  Any advice of what to do or say,1963,352

1258,p8nvjl,0,2,Other Kids Need Them More  I dont know if any of you have ever had this happen to you growing up  but as a kid it always seemed like my nmom deemed other kids more important than myself and my siblings  I remember her always teaching others kids  especially her then boyfriends kids  how to cook  playing with them outside and overall acting as the perfect mother for them  especially if those kids had shitty moms   But when it came to me  it seems like the only thing she taught me was how to clean  And whenever I brought up that she acted more like a mother figure to other kids more than me  it was always the same generic excuse   They need me more  theyre not as lucky as you    And its just like  I needed you too  mom  Moreso because YOURE my mom  and if it mattered that much to her then she should help those kids by getting someone who could pull them out of that situation  of which I do admit  some of their situations were down right terrible and if I would have understood at the time  would have called CPS social services at best and told a teacher or something at school at worst  rather than just try to step in as mom and only give them small amounts of normalcy But    my dad was the one who walked me through cooking how to cook  and not just tell me to read the box   taught me how to drive  etc  And when i would mention this whenever she said she was such a fantastic parent who taught me so much  she would always say something to the effect of   Well thats what a parents supposed to do  and your dads supposed to teach you those things   Which hurts  because Ive ALWAYs heard stories from others about memories theyve had with their parents  of cooking with their moms at a young age  of getting help with things such as going to the DMV or courthouse or insurance places or what have you  basically things parents are SUPPOSED to do for with their children  whereas I only remember being told I have to do it myself because how else would I learn  right  I also have autism  so anything that needed to be done socially in person I always had an anxiety panic attack over and often got yelled at for my emotions and couldnt react like a person A lot of the time    and the TL DR version of it  too  I guess    I often just wish I had those memories of my mom  and had someone with me in several circumstances  especially so when I didnt feel unsafe doing it alone and was there to make me feel safe  who could guide me through it rather than trying to figure things out with a complete stranger who was probably already having a bad day I only made worse because my parent wouldnt be a parent,2643,497
1259,p8nrf9,0,16,Nmom’s confession It’s only “progress” for me but I was  out for drinks  before leaving for college  thank god  with my parents  Nmom and enabler dad  last night when my dad left for the bathroom  My mom said something she knew would provoke me  because it has in the past before I knew better  I  like two beers in  countered with “How do you always manage to say the most wrong thing ” As in  the thing the least likely to console me and most likely to further contribute to the lifelong gaslighting I’ve experienced  You all know the drill She tried to play dumb but then I went “You know exactly what you’re saying and doing  So just stop because it’s not working ”And then she laughed and said “Yeah  I know ”The fact that this all happened when my dad  enabler  had just left the table is as good as an admission to me that all of the gaslighting and emotional abuse was deliberate  And so that she could control the narrative as she’s always tried to  But frankly  I’m happy she gave it to me  I don’t know if she realizes  but she made me feel way less crazy for reacting the way I do to the way she treats me  It still feels profoundly shitty that the person who brought me into this world feels justified in putting me through what’s felt like psychological torture for so many years  For all these years  friends and family have invalidated the way I’ve felt towards my mom and I’ve always known no one was ever truly going to understand  And I think it’s more telling she waited until the night before I’m about to leave to give me this possible tool against her abuse  But at least I know that  at the end of the day  I am not crazy,1650,309

1267,p8me7d,0,6,Is mom a Vulnerable Narcisst or Codependent  Hi guys long time lurker and researcher here  Ive read through many threads and can relate and sympathize with a lot of what youve all been through  I dont want to bore anyone with every detail of my life story so Ill just try to stick to some of the main general points  but its still quite a long story so please bear with me  I am well aware that we shouldnt be trying to diagnose  but mom makes excuses to not go to therapy and we have constant issues every few months even though Ive moved out  So in a way this is my way of venting and I appreciate whoever reads it I lost my dad at age five to a heart attack and mother enmeshed me because she seems to see my father in me  She met someone new about  years after his passing and she began to drink a lot when she would go out with him every weekend and come home until am  I would usually be babysat by a cousin who was like  at the time although she would call to check up and leave food  Eventually her new man moved in with us  years later and it always seemed that he would try to compete with me for affection and sometimes quite frankly resent me a bit  there was snide comments here and there and friction  He wasnt completely terrible  but has an abrasive personality that people tend to dislike definitely arrogant and narcisstic due to his success  I never disrespected him and accepted him and was eager to have a half sibling  Mother started having issues with him after first sibling was born  She always had very little if any boundaries with me and shared way too many details including intimate  I was exposed to quite a few inappropriate things that I shouldnt have heard or been told  It sometimes came from the step dad too  mind you this guy would sometimes come out of the shower naked and not care when he would forget his towel  Mother also had an explosive temper and would yell at me constantly over any mistake I made no matter how trivial  Mistakes that kids make like forgetting something when she sent me to the store  There were times shed get so angry over something she would pull my hair or throw things at me and cuss me out  and sometimes say things like useless good for nothing  To the point even the step dad would sometimes be the voice of reason Almost everyday seemed to be constant yelling from her  I was constantly anxious from hearing her yelling or slamming things when shed be angry cleaning  She was a stay at home mom since I was born and when I asked what was wrong it was always about having to do so much cleaning and cooking and not being helped enough and how she sacrificed herself and was not appreciated  When I would try to help everything I did was wrong and I would never get a thank you  Even step dad would say thank you when I would help him  During age  to  I feel that she constantly put me down and it made me feel that she was embarrassed of me  She only started complementing me when I became a bodybuilder from  to   She is very paranoid and overprotective and would not let me go out much and would constantly call me or my friends when Id go out This made afraid and unable to be more independent because I would get anxious about going out and talking to people  After my nd sibling was born step dad bought her a house and I helped with k for the down payment and moved with them at   I struggled to find work in  to  so it caused some fights  She would defend me from step dad berating me or telling me I should move out at   So no not everything was negative  She seems to want to get a long and its like she has two husbands sometimes  She comes to me for support and for helping raise my siblings and to offer them advice because apparently her husband doesnt care enough She found him texting other women twice and instead of leaving began to drink more and went back to him  Eventually we had an argument and he kicked me out for sleeping in the same bedroom with my girlfriend in his house  but then apologized which is his MO with everything he does  I was finishing college and was at home until  which was my mistake  but I got a full time job and moved out with my SO  We offered mom help to leave him or a place to live if needed  but she said no  We dont feel comfortable going over after what he said to us and this hurts mom because she misses us and wants us to come over   Shes a good company when shes not angry or drinking and getting emotional    I had to instill strict boundaries because despite the damage she wanted to undo with my relationship to step dad she would still call me to vent She is constantly telling me she is hurt because I rarely call or text when I have told her multiple times I dont want to go to the house despite the fact he apologized and would prefer for us to spend time in person and in a neutral place  She never wants to go out and almost always rejects invites because she always says she feels ill   We never got to go out much since I was  because she was always tired or sick  there was times I was not allowed to go anywhere because she didnt feel good  At this point I dont know what to do  She has respected the boundary of not venting to me about her husband anymore after a few strong arguments we had  but she doesnt understand I prefer to do things in person with her or anyone for that matter  Are these issues because she doesnt know how to handle her relationship with her husband and is codependent  A mix of all  At this point what are my options besides boundaries  Will we ever have a healthy

1270,p8ltvd,0,4,Emotions are too overwhelming I never know what to do with my emotions when I experience them  I either ignore the feeling  or  when it gets too hard to ignore  I feel extremely overwhelmed and break down  My mom would yell at every mistake I made  so a lot of my emotions have negative connotations to them because of the way I was treated  Even though I’m not living at her house right now  I feel almost as bad as I did when she would yell at me  and I can’t handle it  I see mistakes in everything I do because I was taught to point them out  I bury my feelings until I can’t anymore  and I never know what to do when I get to that point or how to stop from getting there in the first place  I was never given the proper tools for how to deal with my feelings  and now everything is so overwhelming it’s unbearable,819,162
1271,p8lmqb,0,2,Mother blames my whole existence to her own problems  My  F  mother is a pet hoarder    dogs    cats  other small animals  and she basically prioritize their care over the whole family  including my own sanity  The animals require already a lot of care just solely from the cleaning and feeding  my mother feeds them homemade meals that I manually have to cook   and combined with the fact that my stepfather is overworking and my  year old brother is overwhelming to take care of  my mother readily relied on my whole summer break to care for her pets  She expects  hours of my time to literally cook  feed  and clean for her half of her pets  When I refuse to help due to mental and physical stress  or even time for my own stuff such as studying  she makes some melodramatic excuses about how I am ungrateful for her raising me for  years  how she treats me so nicely financially  how if I wasnt born she wouldnt have to suffered in my birth country  how the animals are her only enjoyment in life  how she is constantly suffering etc  Even a week ago when I was supposed to return to college campus  she made the same excuses and told me to leave  but expect to cut ties with her  even saying that she will not care if I end up somewhere dead  which truly hurt my feelings because she knows that she is the only family I have here and she knows that I have always sacrificed everything as much as I can because she is my mother and I love her  This event obviously forced me to stay and continue toiling away  wasting the one week I had to prepare for an entrance exam and other preparations in college  This summer has been absolutely hell and truly horrid  I remember a day when the whole family was eating sushi at the dining table  I just broke down crying  My stepfather laughed if I was depressed of leaving home  and my mother said I must be crying because of the wasabi   and I just laughed how it was the wasabi that got me  Another day my mother screamed how she should have never given birth to me because I can’t take care of   dogs  later that day  my brother casually joked how I should go back to campus or go die  literally   I cant recall how many times I thought of just ending my life if I am just that worthless  etc  My girlfriend who I confided this to told me how manipulative and neglectful of my mother to toy with my emotions and mental health to get what she wants  but I cant stop justifying my mothers actions be using reasons such as myself being a burden  she is not in a healthy relationship mental being  that I lived with my parents rent free for  months  until I cant take it anymore like right now  Do I really deserve to be treated like this just for existing Edit  for those who are wondering  I’m able to escape this hell hole tomorrow…,2807,525
1272,p8llkd,0,2,I need your opinion on something  So I have already confirmed that my dad is a narcissist  but I dont seem to come up with a term for my mom in all of these years  In my head she has shifted from victim  enabler  normal and a person who has picked on toxic behaviors  from the first time I realized I was in a toxic household I can say that she is somewhat my confident but theres things like when she says  you annoy more than what you help    roughly translated from another language   while being playful  that really makes me question if she could  be a covert narcissist     But heres the thing  her actions and mentality dont go as far as that  she is not straight up neglecting me  abusing me or anything  it could just be the last thing I mentioned  a person who picked up in toxic behaviors   but what do I know about normal people  Thats what I need help with   PERSPECTIVE     Feel free to ask me for more information if needed,948,175

1274,p8l38f,0,15,Thought I would know better than to marry a narc    I am so frustrated  I had an nparent growing up but escaped in my early s  I had nothing and struggled just for survival for years  I thought I was doing well and I thought for sure I would never fall into the trap of marrying someone like my nparent because I have a pretty good eye for narcs    I thought I married someone who seemed kind but maybe a bit incapable  There were always reasonable excuses  They never could really seem to be a partner to me  they needed so much  help   but I thought it was because they had an nparent too and they just didnt have my years of therapy yet  I thought it was  just  anxiety and depression and that they would learn how to care for themselves eventually   I recently asked for a divorce because I came to my senses  with the help of my therapist and good friends  after over a decade and realized theyre a covert narcissist  How   How did I not see this   I have spotted so many Ns in the wild  in my workplace  avoided friendships that I saw were headed to a toxic place    How did I marry someone like that Looking back  I can see the patterns and red flags so clearly  I knew all the terms  gaslighting  love bombing  passive aggression  etc    how did I not realize what was happening  I was so lonely and so unsure and so desperate to be loved  I was willing to except so little because it was better than what I had as a kid  I guess I am so terrified of ever trying to date again because I dont know if I can really trust my instincts anymore    Has anyone succeeded at this after failing once I honestly would rather be alone than go through that again  I gave so much of myself and its so painful to see it meant nothing to them and I get nothing back at all except my tattered freedom  I just feel so empty and small,1841,345

1276,p8kx0j,0,6,Parenting my parents is extremely exhausting I am  but I have a baby face and look a lot younger  so people constantly are talking down on me  I get mad because Ive been parenting my own parents my entire life and I am exhausted and feel old as hell  My nparents are very child like and most of the time behave as such  Being out in public with them always makes me very anxious because they are often atrociously rude and if I dont keep them in line  theyll either hurt others and make me look like an asshole  and I refuse to let that happen We got invited to one of my second cousins wedding  I almost didnt go because I am in early recovery from alcoholism  and my parents were going  I ended up sucking it up because my cousin is such a good guy and really wanted me to be there My parents talked through the entire ceremony  On and on and on until I finally jabbed my mother with my elbow and stared them down until the message got across  Then  at dinner as the waiters were going around confirming everyones order  my dad out of no where started asking the waiter how the steak was cooked and was insisting that they cook mine a different way  I initially thought he was talking about his own steak  but he confirmed he was ordering salmon  He kept going on and on  so I put my hand up signaling him to stop talking  which he ignored  So  I cut him off and told the waiter to please not listen to him and to give me the steak as is  The waiter nervously laughed and walked away  because he could tell I was infuriated  I told my dad that I am capable of ordering on my own and that I think its rude to make ridiculous requests when the waiters were busting their assess to serve all  guests their meals  He just sat there and said nothing  pretending it never happened like children do  I cannot stomach any more public outings with my family  I do not have the mental capacity to deal with them and protect myself from being humiliated by their never ending antics  I cannot parent them anymore  it is just too exhausting and they are just not worth it,2081,393
1277,p8kqls,0,18,I said no      Nmom was ruthlessly rude to me the last time I helped her out  Today she asked for help again  I figured Id give an excuse and be done with it  But  I thought about it and decided fuck that  If I want to move on  I need to be honest  So I said no  and explained WHY I was saying no  Im a little terrified  but I feel stronger than ever  Maybe shell disown me  Maybe shell tell everyone how evil I am  Maybe shell check herself into the ER for attention  But  I set my boundary last time she was awful  which is why she was so awful   and I am sticking to it  I love you all,601,122
1278,p8kncx,0,2,Realizing that my Ndad is probably the reason for my crippling fear of singing in front of people Just an incredibly random thing I wanted to get off my chest Pretty much for as long as I can remember  Ive been absolutely petrified of the idea of singing out loud in front of people  I mean  it is probably my biggest fear in life  Like even singing with other kids in elementary school choir was terrifying to me  and even today  decades later  I cant sing along to a song with my friends in the car without feeling extremely self conscious  The fear is   that   bad  But I never really stopped to think about WHY that is  until recently  My theory is this  When I was a little kid  probably  or  years old   Ndad started pushing me to play music  because he himself played music and was a singer  so of course he wanted me to do that too  And anything that I did  Ndad had to be   involved with  because nothing was purely mine  it was also his too because he owned me  He did this with pretty much all of my hobbies  I just wanted something that was MINE and to not have Ndad trying to be involved  So maybe my fear of singing stems from that The thing is  I actually have a pretty decent singing voice  and it feels like my intense fear is making that go to waste  So thanks a lot Ndad  I couldve had a real talent there but you ruined it for me,1366,261

1291,p8j07t,0,15,I  nb  got guilt tripped for asking to go to urgent care  I ended up having to go to the ER  This is a long one  Obligatory sorry for formatting I’m on mobile For some context  I turned  several months ago  Due to disabilities  the school programme I was in before I graduated  and a planned trip out of state  I don’t have a job  I’m working on it  but at this point in time I am not able to financially support myself and I still live at home  I also can’t drive  still learning  very nervous after a car accident I was in  Both of my parents  but my mom especially  are neglectful regarding medical treatment  We are an upper middle class family  My parents have over a million in savings  and we go on nice yearly vacations  There is no excuse Things have been better since I graduated because my mom’s main “reason” for not believing me was because she thought I wanted to get out of going to school About three days ago I started having unexplained left side chest pain  I worked up the courage and asked my mom if I could get an appointment with my GP  she said yes and I went to my GP yesterday They did some blood work and said it’s likely anxiety  I have an anxiety disorder   On the paperwork they sent me  it said to go to the ER or call  if symptoms worsened A few hours after the appointment  my chest pain worsened  I had increased pain  moving in certain ways was painful  and I couldn’t get in a full breath I texted my mom asking her to take me to urgent care  this was before we received the document from the GP   My mom said no and had me come lay downstairs with her and my dad  this is when we received the document electronically  My mom is the one who got it and I sent it to myself on her phone   When I read that I should be going to the ER  I started to speak up for myself a bit more  I told them I don’t feel well  I’m in pain  and I’m having trouble breathing  My mom said I wasn’t in “respiratory distress” and that she was right there and could see I wasn’t having trouble breathing  I would estimate I was breathing   times a minute  normal is    I also couldn’t talk for very long without stopping to catch my breath  Both my parents told me that if it’s so bad that I have to go to urgent care  then I would have to tell my friend’s mom I couldn’t pet sit tomorrow  Which is another attempt at trying to guilt trip me  but my friend’s mom is practically my mom and is very understanding so it was no problem My dad started guilt tripping me because “the hospitals are full with COVID patients ”  “the doctors are overwhelmed with COVID ” And that I “would be taking a bed from someone who needs it”  I called him out on guilt tripping and he said he was “just stating facts ”I eventually argued with them enough that my mom said “Fine  I’ll take you to urgent care ” And my dad asked me if I “really wanted to do this when the hospitals are overrun ”My mom and I go to urgent care  She is clearly pissed  but turns into the “concerned mom” once we get to urgent care  We are checking in and she says “why don’t you sit down while we wait ” Luckily I know her BS so once she got to the front of the line  I got up and stood with her to check me in  By a turn of fate  turns out we needed my ID  so my mom went back to get it  At this point  I inform the one of the women at the front desk that my GP said I should go to the ER or call  if my symptoms worsened  They jump me up the line and I am taken in to get an EKG I told the nurse and the doctor what my GP said  They asked me why I was at urgent care and not the ER  I inform them that my mom is Just Like That and that she wasn’t even going to take me here  I was crying while telling her this When my mom gets back  she is taken into the room with me  The doctor chews her out  Tells her if my GP says that I should go to the ER or call  if symptoms worsen  then I should be at the ER right now and “I know it’s none of my business  but your kid is obviously afraid of you and that’s not okay ” She tells my mom either she can drive me to the ER or they can call  to take me My mom chooses to drive me to the ER  When we got in the car she tells me that “It really hurt my feelings when you told the doctor you’re scared of me ” I told her “I don’t care  I didn’t  She realized that herself  You have been doing this to my medical stuff for years and you finally got told you were wrong ” After which she was quiet At the ER  I eventually make her leave  I told her to go home and I don’t want her their she said “but I want to be here and make sure you’re okay ” I got pissed off enough and told her “ I  don’t want you here  Leave ” She left  I’m lucky I’m  otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to  If she didn’t leave I think I would have had to get security to get her to leave After she leaves  breathing gets really hard  I collapsed when I got up after they called my name  I get chest x rays  they look at the EKG I got at urgent care  take blood  and give me an IV and some fluids  It’s nothing immediately concerning  Nothing wrong on the chest x ray  EKG is normal  heart sounds normal  They don’t know what’s wrong  I got referred to a cardiologist and I need to make that appointment My mom comes and gets me from the ER at about am  She pretends everything is fine in the car  None of us have talked about the whole situation  I don’t know how to address it or if I should  My chest pain is still there  but I got a prescription for a lot of ibuprofen  It hasn’t gotten worse  Moving around is still uncomfortable  but I’m okay  I don’t know what I’m going to do about this whole thing,5658,1113

1294,p8iruz,0,9,Avoiding Important Events Does anyone else want to entirely forgo big events  getting married  housewarming  holidays  because of their nparent s  I’m in the process of buying my first house  I held off on telling my grandparents  notorious flying monkeys  until all the inspections were done  because they’re incredibly negative and they would have made me more nervous  I honestly only told them because I didn’t want to do it too close to moving time or try to keep it a secret and face the barrage of “why don’t you tell us anything ” Etc  My grandma  mom’s mom  and I used to be extremely close before I moved out and went NC  Now she is a textbook flying monkey  but our old relationship makes it hard to keep an info diet  In my excitement  I sent her the Zillow link and told her some details  Flash forward the next day  my nMom has my new address and makes comments about the house to my brother  She is now acting distraught because she’ll never be allowed in my house  blah blah  And it just makes me never want to have a big life event again  Like  why have a wedding when it’ll be overshadowed by family members who think I’m evil for not inviting my parents  Why have kids when she might go to extremes to contact them and fuck them up too   It’s just so frustrating that NC is NOT the freedom I thought it would be  It’s almost worse  like it’s a perverse game and my nparents have gotten good at playing  I know  at the end of the day  I can and will still do anything I want  I am lucky in that cutting off my parents was not at all tied to my finances or ability to do things in the future  they’ve always been too broke  But today  I am sad   I want to be able to share excitement and news without the dread of when not if  they find out,1768,334

1296,p8ii0n,0,6,Im just so conflicted and hurt    So  this past Sunday I had met up with my NMom and her husband to catch up  really I just wanted the Christmas stuff that had belonged to my dad   and Ive been dealing with conflicting emotions about it since  and yesterday has only made it worse My step mother  aka my Mama  and my older sister  Ill just call her sister as I rarely speak to my younger sister  were in town yesterday and decided to surprise me and pick me up from work so we can all hang out  and then theyd come over to check out my new place  I was so excited  they live a town over so I rarely see them in person anymore as I dont drive  massive anxiety issues  and theyre always too busy to come out my way  Our last official hang out was Thanksgiving last year  Ive seen them both in person once since  So this was something I was absolutely over the moon about  time with my Mama and sister  a treat  Boy  was I wrong Their idea of a hangout was to drag me to a high end lingerie store so they could shop for over  hours  Im ftm  although still in the closet  so lacey bras and panties aint my thing lol   The whole time they talked to me for all of  minutes  mostly just to inquire about the things my NMom had said n whatnot  I was just so uncomfortable and awkward the whole time  I had just gotten off an  hour shift and still had to get up at am Friday morning for work   They were both having a better time and obviously getting along so much better than with me  I felt like such a third wheel  And then because they spent so much time shopping  they barely had time to check out my new place as they had to head back home as they had plans for the evening And then the most heartbreaking thing for me was that they basically told me that if I ever wanted to do a day trip  or go off roading with them anytime in the future that I had to bus to their city  easily almost  hours one way  because I was too far of a drive for them and it was too tiring to get me if they had to do the driving for the trip all day  and of course gas would be too much  even though I offered to pay for some of it   Its like a   minute drive to my place  so like I can understand where theyre coming from  but ouch  My Mama has posted her near daily travels here  there  and everywhere in our local areas over the pandemic  shes an avid hiker  its how her and my dad met  And my sister never goes anywhere  shes a bit of a homebody for the most part  But like  I know I shouldnt expect people to drive me everywhere  but with them telling me that Im basically too much of a hassle to get and I have to do all that to earn their time  it fucking hurts  Theyve barely spent time with me anyways because of the pandemic  its always been a hassle trying to plan anything with anyone because of conflicting schedules  so Ive just stopped trying  I feel like a burden  an afterthought  and they were supposed to be my support  we all grew closer after my dad died  so I thought at least  And thats where I feel so conflicted  The person Im supposed to hate  My NMom  was nothing but attentive  supportive  and dare I say loving during our visit  My Mama and sister spent more time together even when they had me around  barely talked to me  and were rushing to drop me off and leave  I had to  ask for a hug  I think they wouldnt have said I love you if I hadnt had said it first  My NMom hugged me twice and kept reminding me how much she loved me the whole time  I know it might be manipulation  a front  but with how the family Ive chosen to stay in contact with is acting right now  its fucking working  Im so confused  so lost and hurt  I dont know what to do  my heads a mess and Im so overwhelmed my brains been on autopilot all week  I feel like a burden  like my Mama and sister would be better off without me  Im tired of having to fight for peoples love and attention  I feel so alone  This sucks,3961,776

1299,p8i8tf,0,4,Longpost  I recently stood up to my abusive Mom but Im unsure of my next steps For some background  I am College age  Only recently  with my newfound freedom and being away from my place of abuse  am I learning the extant of my issues and where they lead back to  This is my first time posting on this sub  and first time reaching out on a forum about this Ive been doing Low Contact with my mother for a while  and visiting for a weekend once every   weeks  mostly to see my dogs and friends in the area   Last year I had to stay there over Christmas break  and it absolutely fucked me  I started the next semester regressed and depressed  Due to reasons  I had to leave dorms for a week and go back home  This was greatly distressing  and I talked to some friends  and my sister about it  and what I should do  That in of itself was a big step for me as prior I had never talked about my issues at home before  At the time its what was normal The plan was to politely  but assertively set some basic boundaries and try to get along  Like please dont burst into my room while Im working  please knock  That was respected twice and was more akin to door pounding than knocking  The third time  I said I was busy at the moment  so she opened the door anyways telling me how she thought this was stupid  that she was my mother and it was her house  that she didnt see why I was treating her like this its not like Im beating you  I said yeah  but you used to  She walked away So then with that  and the larger fact that I felt like a frog slowly being boiled by staying in that house  I decided it wasnt going to work and that I would leave  for the sake of my own mental health  I told her that I was just staying for the weekend  and for the rest of the week I was going to stay with my  nonexistent  boyfriend  She didnt react  I guess me coming out and leaving early cancelled each other out  As I was packing my things she asked  are we good  I told her that it was difficult for me to stay here for long periods of time  that there were some bad memories here  I gave a few examples  she had no memory ofc   that I didnt think of her as a complete black white villain but I think after the divorce she was very angry and often took it out on me  that despite that I was still trying to make it work with boundaries and that I wasnt going no contact like my sister had and that that should be appreciated at least Her response  That since I had so many bad memories here she guesses she should sell the house then  Then  a pseudo apology of im sorry IF  then into a YEAH I was angry ykno your father    I wasnt going to hear anymore and I cut her off and left  Stayed at a shitty motel for a little bit then drove a distance to my Dads  Talked to him about things and have since been taking the time to work through shit To briefly paint a picture from where Im coming from  my early childhood lt  was alright  I spent most of the time in after care centers as both my parents worked  but it was alright  When I was   my parents started fighting  and by  they were divorced  I liked my Father a lot more  but it was my Mom who got custody  The rug got pulled out from under me   During the divorce she accused my Dad of all sorts of false heinous shit  no low she wouldnt stoop to Then  I was alone with her  and things started to get worse  I was  and am  still a lot like my Father  She hated him  I reminded her of him  and so she hated me  She tried hard to change me  Dragging me to various doctors and therapists to medicate me and find out what was wrong with me  Of course  the issue never was the home life  it was ADHD  ADD  Aspergers  or many a other of various label I got sent to a psych ward  not for cutting or suicide attempts  she never noticed that  I had stopped cutting at this time and was just beginning to develop healthier copes like dissociating and escapism  for stargazing on the roof of our story house  Afraid I was going to jump onto the grass and kill myself   Being surrounded by properly fucked up people and stuck in a small room for majority of the week wasnt too fun at   I got sent to a bootcamp a year later for reasons I still dont know  She still maintains she thought it was like a Boy Scout camp  Their website and marketing did nothing to imply such things  Also wasnt too fun She was emotionally and verbally abusive  One time in Elementary  I was being bullied and tried to confide in her about it  She asked  what were they saying  I told her and she laughed  She thought it was hilarious and then echoed back to me the same words my bullies were saying to me on the school yard  She told me I had to learn to laugh at myself  and I was being too sensitive  She became one of my bullies that day  Some phrases that are burned in deep  and that I echo to myself   I hate you   I wish I never had you   Shed call me names too  most frequently  little shit  and funnily  son of a bitch   lol  She was physically abusive  I watched her beat my Grandma and my dogs  She had no hesitations to smack me  or if I was making a fuss in a restaurant to take me outside and beat me  This didnt last as long as the emotional abuse as I got to be a tall kid quickly  But I remember when it stopped  She was chasing me through the house with a rolling pin like some shit from looney tunes  I ran into my room  got to the far end of my bed to have a barrier  she came at me  I kicked her away  She then flipped modes like a switch and started to weep and said I was going to kill her If we got into an argument or if my grades were low she wouldnt hesitate to throw my computer games into the water behind our house  learned to pirate tho     Once she took a bat to my computer because I was spending too much time on it  She accused it of being my god lmao She was  and is  controlling  She has looked through my phone and texts  When I got a girlfriend she did not approve and encouraged me to break up with her  She unapologetically read through my childhood journal  Every science fair project as a child was a fight for control  I wanted to do science  but I wouldve done it wrong  It was her idea  her way These things  Ive been coming to learn  have affected me in the following ways  not exhaustive  still learning   I am completely clueless as to what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like  I have a bad track record with dating narcissists and rejecting  or rather avoiding  the love of genuine  kind people  because it is unfamiliar and alien to me Self harm  I never learned much how to process my emotions  I did my best to suppress them  but painful emotions in particular would knock down the walls I built and flood me  When they did  not being able to process them internally  I learned to cut myself so I could at least process them physically  With age I tried to stop this because I knew it was unhealthy  but I learned Ill just subconsciously swap vices  such as knowingly going into dangerous situations so I could get hurt by others  or substance abuse  spent a year abusing psychs just fucking my mind up   I also tried to kill myself twice Emotionally Avoidant  Although I desire it greatly  I am scared of emotional intimacy  I have a tendency of once getting close to a partner or friend  distancing myself from them  or acting shitty towards them so they will stop caring about me and leave me alone  I have a deep subconscious belief that I am not deserving of love or care What Ive done so far  Ive been meditating and introspecting a lot  I have learned to practice self love  and positive self talk  I am now able to comfort myself  and encourage myself  Ive learned to talk about my problems with trusted friends  I still get distant for a bit after I do  but they are patient and I come back to them  The distant periods are gradually getting shorter  Ive been reading a lot and doing general self development work  Im currently reading  The Emotionally Absent Mother  by Jasmin Lee Cori  Its been a difficult book to get through  but Ive been able to identify the things I need to work on  and why I am the way I am  Its been greatly helpful so far and I encourage others in similar situations to give it a read What I plan to do  Free myself  financially  cellularly  and on the internet  Close completely my old shared checking account  have already opened my own at a different bank   Get my own cell provider  Purge all internet accounts that my Mother is aware of  Also I have been hunting for a therapist  Ive been calling for one each day  but my insurance isnt great and its been a slog What Im still grappling with  Finding a substitute   cure for self harm tendencies  Ive noticed if I dont consciously engage I will subconsciously find ways to hurt myself when things get shitty  Ive been practicing more self love and these desires have been reduced  but I still worry about relapsing the next time I get a depressive episode How to prepare myself for actually dating and being a good partner  Its very important for me to get over my attachment issues  and from reading it seems one of the best ways to do so is to develop a secure attachment with someone  Most commonly these are done through intimate relationships  but I feel wholly incompetent  and in my experience I either get hurt or hurt the other person  so I have been avoiding this aspect of life Going Low Contact or No Contact  I still have friends in the area around my home that I like to see  which would be much harder to do without having a place to stay  I also miss my dogs very much  and I mostly have been visiting home for them  But at this point NC seems best Open to any advice questions book recommendations or sharing of experiences,9802,1838

1302,p8hznl,0,48,Story I posted in AITA  parents gladly accepted my brothers admission to my old dream school but not mine 😬 So  for context…I am a twin with a twin brother    years ago  I got accepted to Texas A amp M University architecture with a scholarship…but my brother didn’t so I had to sacrifice my admission since my brother couldn’t get into their engineering program  It didn’t help that they hyped me up all high school senior year to go  then when my brother didn’t get accepted  i was expected to reject my admission because supposedly It was too expensive of a school to go to  Well  I am still in my undergrad at another university  after depression issues  and my brother graduated with his undergrad this spring  He got accepted to the masters engineering program at TAMU  and my Family happily celebrated… now saying everyone in the family should now be an Aggie because they are finally having an Aggie  🙄 I am a year away from graduating with my undergrad  and they are telling me I should go to TAMU to do my masters  I basically told them no  that I rather go to UT arch now since after research it’s the best public school in Texas  I even told them that since I was a  year old kid they destroyed my dreams of ever wanting to go to that school now and I don’t want anything to do with TAMU after what happened We are dropping my brother off today  and I can’t help but feel like I am an asshole because my mom keeps asking why I am not happy for my brother  Honestly  I just feel very mad that my parents made me sacrifice going there  years ago and when my brother got accepted to the university  it’s suddenly so great and all the kids in the family should go  I am usually forgiving  but when it comes to this i get really emotional teary eyed that I can’t forgive my parents  It fucking sucks hearing them talk about how great the university is when I could have gone there a long time ago  How do you guys think I should combat this feeling I have  Am I being an Asshole Edit  I gotta add  I am relatively close to my brother  I just feel like there been distance between us ever since he graduated and got accepted to TAMU  He’s been talking down to me more lately  and It feels like the TAMU thing is just a big rub in my face like  yes I won  I am going to TAMU  and you didn’t  I graduated first from college  and you are the older twin type of shit Edit   Parents kept asking me why I was sad  and i ended up telling them the truth about what I told you guys  Dad got really furious at me  and my mom started making a scene by crying  Dad told me that I am nothing to this family  and they don’t need me around if i am just gonna bring negativity when I am at home  They said that I will never be cared for like the way they treat me  and I need to know my place  Dad also told me i am his weakest child  and I am just spoiled and need to open my eyes to who actually cares for me  My apartment is about  hours away from cstat um yeah that’s about It  Cried throughout the argument  then i was cut off from finishing the argument when i had questions about their assumptions  I cried  but my dad forced me to smile then patted my shoulder as i smiled and said  “you are much prettier when you smile ” Yeah ThAts about It  I guess lol,3268,631
1303,p8hynm,0,2,Frustrating conversation with my mother  My N mom is     Rather difficult to get along with   We have both roughly agreed to keep conversations light and not really discuss heavy things since she  cant handle it  or whatever   For reference  Im  and have to live with my parents because I became disabled and unable to support myself due to genetic conditions that are out of my control   Well  today  before my doctors appointment  I was talking with her about media  first Star Trek and its actors and then Arrested Development   She really likes Arrested Development  which is fine  I like it to an extent but its also got a lot of stuff that makes me uncomfortable   I mentioned to her that  the show is like    funny to me  I like the slapstick and some of the weird situations that would almost never happen in real life  stealing a house for example  but the jokes about disability and LGBT people arent something that I  as a disabled trans woman  like    Apparently  that was  too critical  and  PC culture is ruining everything where we cant even say R••••d any more about people who are R••••••d when its just a medical term  and how when I watch media I  only look for negatives in it   and  dont just enjoy the media for what it is  instead everything has to be negative    Coming from the person who is currently half yelling at me over saying that   of a show made me uncomfortable but otherwise it was fine and its just a product of its time   I pointed out how you can be critical of media while still enjoying it  and that doesnt make you a bad person  its not a personal attack on you  and when even doctors dont use a term anymore  maybe theres a point where you should understand that its offensive   Apparently that too was a personal attack because she went on and on about how I  think shes a bigot or a racist or a homophobe or whatever  because she  likes some media with offensive jokes    My E dad came home around the same time I got back from my doctors appointment  and I talked to him about it  and he was basically like   I dont know how else you could phrase it  sorry    Like  it doesnt help that both of them tried to tell me for years I wasnt trans and are  only now  kind of accepting of it   They call me the correct name and pronouns mostly  and have shown theyre capable of change  but theyre still anti covid vaccine anti mask Trump supporters who view  The left  as the evil boogeymen who are coming to  trans your children  or whatever   Its so frustrating that I cant   healthily   criticize media without it being a personal attack on my mom   Sometimes I wonder if my mom is even abusive or narcissistic  then this kind of thing happens where she puts all the blame on me and how I  lied since I was a child    She even tried to blame my lack of mobility on my depression   My doctor today was like   No  early childhood trauma can cause pains and such  but being less depressed wont make it go away,2988,552

1305,p8hpr8,0,18,My Mother is Trying to Get My  Year Old Sister to Waive Her Legal Rights Without Her Knowing So for context  Im early s  recently graduated college and still live at home  My younger sister is   and has just started school at an out of school university  Ill call her C  for this post  I stuck around for her  and now that shes going to be out of the house for the majority of the year for a while  Im beginning to work on moving out  Scroll all the way down for the TL DR  Throughout our lives  my mother has been rather controlling  I was never allowed to walk to places in town  even the public library  which is two blocks away  or attend sleepovers  Even now  she tracks my and my sisters phones  She always justifies it because shes anxious about our safety  and she was always our main caretaker  My father was around  but outside of driving us places he never did any actual raising  He also enables my mother in everything  Cs move in day was a rush  My mom was scrambling to get forms signed before they left  which I assumed was standard college stuff  Then she starts talking about getting them notarized right away  just to come back frustrated because they needed an appointment and two witnesses  I heard the words  power of attorney  and then I started snooping  She bought a pdf pack of legal forms  which include a Health Care Directive  Proxy Directive  and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care  a HIPAA Release Form and Durable Power of Attorney for Financial Decisions for C  I made copies of the forms when she was asleep  and then read over them  I even found the website she bought them from  which advertises this packet as  what if your  year old out of state college student got into a car accident and you the parent couldnt access their medical records because theyre legally an adult now   The reason Im absolutely certain she didnt read them  and didnt let C read through them or explain what any of the legalese meant  is because my mother didnt know they had to be notarized until the last minute  Shes honestly been treating it like standard college forms  The first one  the Health Care Directive and Durable PoA for Health Care is fine  Its basically giving my mother rights to make health care decisions should C be incapacitated  and a directive about what actions to take if she was ever permanently in a vegetative state  The only concern I have about that is that its a strange thing to make your adult child sign without explaining what it is  Its the HIPAA Release Form and the Durable PoA for Financial Decisions thats worrying me  HIPAA is basically healthcare privacy  and as far as Im understanding  this document would apply indefinitely to every doctor in the US C will ever have  My mother would be able to access any and every medical record about anything  including reproductive health or therapy   whether C is  or   The language on the Durable PoA for Financial Decisions implies that it would apply from the moment the document came into effect  not just in the case C became incapacitated  It gives our mom control over all financial aspects  credit cards  loans  stocks and bonds  even mortgages  Given that my mother wanted C to sign all these forms last minute  I have no doubt C hasnt actually read any of them and assumed they were whatever my mother told her was true  This also might be a direct result of something I did  Im transgender  and my mother wasnt supportive  so I started medical transition without her permission or knowledge  I think the legal forms for my sister are at least partly a result of that  I also went out of state for school  and my mom didnt try legal forms with me  just emotional pressure  Luckily  my mother cant get the forms signed the forms nor can they get notarized until Cs in state again  which wont be until the end of this year  once her winter break starts  This gives me time  Im a little afraid what my mom might do if C refuses  I also know that if C refuses  my mother will blame my interference  whether or not she has any proof of it    TL DR    My mother tried to get my  year old sister   C   to sign off on Durable Power of Attorneys and a HIPAA release form  which would give my mother control over her finances and access to any of her medical records indefinitely  without explaining that said forms would do that  My mother was unable to get the forms signed  but I have no doubt shell try again when C is back from school  C goes to college out of state  in a few months  My father enables my

1337,p8dmru,0,2,Anyone notice how your abuser plays the victim after standing up for yourself  I grew up with a somewhat absent father  My mom would work  cook  clean  and give me attention while my dad simply babysat me and when my mom would come hed be bolting out the door to sell and smoke weed with his friends  Hed yell at me for the dumbest of reasons  making me cry everytime  Eventually he started spoiling me with McDonalds and crappy PS games just to be the  cool dad   My mom and dad had been separated of  years now  since I was   Ever since that shes been dating men that all fit the same criteria  middle age  unattractive and redneck  Safe to say she had her heart broken multiple times  The second last time this ugly troglodyte of a man abused our dogs with a shock collar  A few times she would ask me  a  year old kid who was very naive  if they  mom and troglodyte  should stay together  One time I said no and after that she said they made a  pact   Then I was sexually assaulted via dry humping and stole over    with a fake Bitcoin scheme  After that  we kept having this guy over and she did this  sneaking out  scheme where he would be left without anyone  I was visiting my real dad and told him about the situation  He called my mom and threatened to call the cops  she swore to herself and me that she wouldnt date anyone on focus on being a parent  Not even a month later  while she was supporting a local DJ that was friends with her  she met her current boyfriend  Get this   she made the first move  After that they became friends and started dating a week later  I was indifferent  I kept to myself and stayed in my room all the time  But then I met him  At first he was pretty nice to me  but because of the past I didnt hesitate to not trust this guy  At first I found him to be creepy he had a rather obsessive liking for trains  with a couple of religious memorabilia and a clock with a Japanese school bell in his house  At the time i had an interest in electronics  Arduino  R Pi and the like  so he gave me his old breadboard kit and I lost interest almost immediately  At first he said I was an  alright guy  and then it spiraled into me being disrespectful  This  combined with my extreme right wing political parroting at school  Im center left now  made me a rather bratty kid  It eventually led to him telling me that hes going to beat the shit out of me  hospitalize me  etc  A good example when he was  ft apart from me and made punching moves toward my face  This man was   Another example was when we were going out camping  he had tapped me on my ass  saying  good job  for something I did  I freaked out  asking him if he were gay  I was closeted at the time  he had gotten very confrontational  threatened to beat me up and put his hands on me and pushed me  I went back into the camper and he started comparing himself to the  old fuck on the farm  and he  wouldnt take shit from nobody   Instead of trying to correct any hatred between us  my mom decided to add fuel to the fire by having us move in with him not even a year later  It was awful  Cops were being called by me every week because I felt like my life was in danger  with good reason  But every  single  time  the chief of police would tell me over the phone   Shut the fuck up  do what your parents are telling you  and stop calling us   The same chief had threatened to punch me in the face  and even shoot me  I had my crotch grabbed  I had been told by him his penis size  I had been told that if I were a girl itd be neat to want to masturbate  all while hes telling me Im a pedophile for being gay  and would show me  evidence  that the LGBT is full of pedophiles  I had been told by him that  because of my poor handwriting  I shouldve been held back to the third grade A month ago  I had been confronted for using a shower without their permission Stepdad  what the fuck Me  what Stepdad  what do you mean  what  We started arguing and he would use personal attacks against me  such as me being a  menace to society  and that  he cant wait for me to move out at   and  youre lucky I have self control so I cant beat your fucking ass   The final straw was when he had come up to my face  feet close  puckered and blew a kiss  I said  thats really funny   YEAAHHHH   Replied Dave  I tell you what  I fucking SNAPPED  I punched him in his stupid  ugly  fucking face  And then we finally fought  And Ill tell you what  it was a full on BRAWL   eventually I got arrested for assault and now have a court case  After all the years of me being made fun of  being mistreated by authority figures  and this is the result  Are you happy now  You decided to put me on trial and potentially put me in a horrible place with   surveillance  violent inmates and possible human rights violations  I could very well be going to juvie for  months  which Ive only been to for a night  Thanks  America  Im going to juvie and hes labeled a victim,4990,959

1347,p8ctv8,0,10,PTSD from parents showing inappropriate content as a child    T W r pe assault scenes in movies  I’ve phrased the title as a question  because this is something I am wrestling with and whilst I’ve signed up for therapy and I’m waiting for an appointment  I just wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar When I was around  years old  I was playing on the PC in the living room  I don’t remember the time but I know that I didn’t really have an enforced bed time by this age  and my mother put on one of her favourite movies   The Accused starring Jodie Foster  I’m not going to go into the details here  but there is a very graphic scene involving the main character being sexually assaulted  I vividly remember being frozen to the spot  asking my mother to please turn it off as the scene was upsetting me and my mother telling me that if I didn’t like it I could “go to my room” and I should have but I felt rooted to my chair  That night I went to bed and the scene just played over and over in my head  My mother offered no context or explanation of what had happened in the scene or made any attempt to soothe me This happened a few more times over the years  different movies but similar scenes and I reacted the same  rooted in the chair in fear but unable to look away  My mother never turned off the scenes or talked to me about them afterward Even to this day  if The Accused is mentioned my mother raves about it being one of her favourite movies and I am left feeling sick I’m now an adult  however I find these scenes to be triggering   much more than discomfort though  If I come across a scene in a movie or tv show I will obsess about it for days and have the urge to read more about it or even rewatch it even though I know it will distress me even more  I will keep playing the scene in my head over and over  not on purpose but it won’t go away I have to google movie plots and parent guides before I’ll even sit with my partner to watch something  and it’s exhausting I guess my question is has anyone else been through something similar and do you have any coping strategies  I’m searching it up on the internet but not finding much If you read this far  thank you,2221,418
1348,p8cnvm,0,6,Is this Emotional Incest  I f  want to start this off by saying I love my father    He is a good man and we generally have a good relationship  however recent events have opened my eyes to a pattern of behavior that doesnt seem healthy for a father daughter relationship My parents divorced when I was   My mother remained single  but my father married a woman when I was  and later they had my baby sister  They eventually split up after  or  years but throughout their relationship  he would complain to me about women and taught me not to be  one of those women   He was very sexist and I eventually started calling him out on it as I got older I am the eldest of his  daughters   hes changed his view on women but it took a lot of talking arguments  and hes still nowhere near being considered a feminist  He has a different relationship with each of his children and the dynamics are constantly changing  I know parents arent supposed to have favorites but I always felt that out of the  of us I was his favorite this changed recently   He would always tell me he expected the most from me out of all of my siblings  and that hes scared my siblings will leave him when hes old but not me  He spent countless hours lecturing me on how to be a good person and telling me what kind of woman he wants me to be  I dont think this was conscious of him  but I feel like he was molding me into the type of woman   he   wanted to be with  As I got older he confided in me more and more using me as a free therapist  This stopped after I eventually snapped and told him to stop treating me like one  My father is a very generous and caring man he would give someone the shirt off his back if they needed it  but what he gives each of his kids is very different  He gives my brother the eldest  technology and pretty much anything he sees as practical  He gives my sisters the babies  anything they want theyre not very materialistic though so its mostly crafts supplies  He gives me grown things  we were all living in a  bedroom apt so he bought a house and said it was for me  I was getting bruises all over my back from my bed so he bought the whole family new beds mattresses and said he did it because of me  Dont get me wrong Im very grateful for my fathers generosity but those are   huge   financial burdens and that puts a lot of pressure on me  Hes always put a lot of pressure on me so I dont think he even realizes it Our relationship took one of its biggest hits after I started dating my ex girlfriend  To be fair she was an awful human who manipulated and gaslit me constantly  but she did point out a few weird things about my relationship with my family  She told me once and this could have been a lie  that my father told her mother that because he didnt have a wife I would have to step up and take on the role of the woman of the house  They were constantly at ends  telling me to do two conflicting things and both expecting me to listen to them blindly  They both expected me to cut off the other  I was obedient and young so trying to please them both ended with me ruining my relationships with both of them  The thing that finally tore our relationship apart was when I moved in with my boyfriend last winter  We rarely talk now  He never says  I love you  anymore  It hurts and idk why hes treating me like such a disappointment  Im doing well for myself and I like to think Im a good person  idk why thats not enough,3480,660

1356,p8c3s8,0,5,Im a Bipolar ex Alcoholic Opiate addict  and my mom is a complete psycho that is obsessed with everything I do  Im a  yr old male and with the exception of Pot have been clean since May th   and my mom has been an obsessive control freak since I was in Middle School  I was always a good kid growing up  Never got into trouble  didnt party and always avoided drama  Shes done it all  Gone through my phone  to read messages and get my friends phone numbers to keep tabs   listened to my calls on the houseline  followed me around in the car  to this day Im constantly terrified shes watching me from somewhere in the distance and Ill see that gray Toyota Sienna   interrogated my friends behind my back  even threatened my girlfriend when I was  to not see me anymore behind my back which was devastating   keeps tabs on me by checking public records for any tickets or recent arrests despite me not being a felon or ever being charged with a misdemeanor  keeping tabs on credit card purchases  an adult friend of mine once wouldnt even come over when my parents were out of town because she was convinced my mom had hidden cameras in the house etc  Needless to say  she has no shame in stalking my every move if she even remotely suspects Im partying  Heres the thing though   this was back when I was in my early s working   hrs per week trying to become independent and just have fun with friends when I had down time  Growing up she was the exact same way except she was EXTREMELY religious  Christian   Im a Atheist so yeah  that was insane  She grew up in an extremely religious and dysfunctional household with an abusive Valium addicted mother who did the exact same crazy stuff my mom does  My mom vowed to NEVER end up like her  but she has  I got kicked out for two years at the beginning of  when my substance abuse continued  only I had recently been diagnosed as Bipolar  I also have Aspergers and have always been told Im extremely intelligent and talented  I play guitar and specialize in heavy metal which is what I aspire to do   but Ive always been extremely insecure and depressed  Ive always struggled making friends because of my awkwardness  but despite my kindness I always get stabbed in the back or abandoned by my closest friends sooner or later that Ive only ever been there for  When I got kicked out every single one of my  friends  immediately ghosted me  but only after making me out to be a piece of crap which seems to be the go to way of handling people these days among most  When I was homeless it was nothing more than the  tough love  approach when I know it was just a selfish attempt to control me again  She only wanted me to get clean so shed stop worrying about me all the time  but she convinces herself its always with good intentions and not narcissistic ones  I went through a cycle of living on the streets all strung out on Vodka  Crack and hardcore Opiates  Psych Wards  in patient rehab for  months  Sober Living Facility where Id get kicked out after several months because of a bad relapse then repeat the cycle  After a two week bender on the cold streets I decided abruptly on the night of May th  I was done  and oddly my parents let me move back in the next day which was weird because they were so stubborn about it  Been off the hard stuff ever since and I dont do any of that mainstream recovery crap that doesnt seem to help anybody in the long run anyway for the most part  you see a lot of the same faces going in and out of those types of facilities   If you just believe in yourself you can do anything  I hate that mainstream recovery programs push religious  step mumbo jumbo and codependency  Anyway moving on  she is literally like a mad scientist when it comes to my medication  Bipolar  addictions etc  No matter what improvements I make shell always find a way to make it out like I need more professional help  As shes getting older  mid s  shes becoming more and more stubborn and unwilling to back off  Before shed actually listen and attempt to make a change in her behavior  Now she just seems to not care at all  All she ever talks to me about now is Bipolar  mania  addictions  Psychologists  doctors  support groups  peer support  working with a job agency  even though I already make my own independent money just fine   and whenever I casually mention going on a trip  seeing a friend or trying out a dating app she makes the same dumb  predictable  anxious grimace that immediately reveals shes thinking the worst  relapse   Ive explicitly said to NEVER talk about Psychologists  I hate them because theyve only ever made things worse  or my personal life  yet she does on a daily basis  Once I finally cant take it and I assertively say  No more  Im done  and walk away  she talks AT me like Im a spoiled child  I finally realize that she has always viewed me as a helpless little boy that needs assistance in everything he does  She holds my past mistakes against me  and feels   in her right to violate my privacy and business even if it means stalking me  Shell occasionally take into account what I say when I finally lash out because shes not getting the hint  but she ALWAYS goes right back to her old ways within a week or two after trying to be more aware of her behavior  I in general am realizing now that Im clean just how narcissistic she really is  She constantly seeks the approval of others and when she doesnt get it she gets offended  she is obsessed with my well being to the point that her well being relies on my well being  she cant take negative criticism of any kind even if it comes from a number of people but complains all day about people being to sensitive these days  She talks AT me  not to me  and she forces advice at me even when I dont want it  but if I come flat out and say I got it or no I dont want help she gets agitated at me  oh yeah  shes the most passive aggressive person Ive ever seen   This is literally not even the tip of the iceberg  I know Ill move out one day  but Im just grateful to be in this big luxurious house where I have the entire finished basement level all to myself so I never have to see her upstairs  The reason Im still here honestly is because once I move I want it to be permanent  I have no idea where I want that to be yet  The big reason though is that Im still recovering from the psychological distress of being homeless for two years and everything that happened before and during all that sadness  Sleeping on wet  stinky concrete behind the dumpsters in the cold night rain next to the vacant eleven gas station I managed years back while chugging vodka and shooting Heroin because my girlfriend and best friend both died less than  months apart is pretty horrible  Theres nothing like feeling everybody you ever loved hates you and has only proven their selfishness by not even giving you a couch to sleep on for the night or to call every few days to see if youre okay  Nothing  I wouldve done anything I could to help a friend who was in my shoes  Why are people like this  Why is my mom like this  I feel like everything everybody tells me is just a lie  Even the doctors  I was taking several different meds none of which worked  I abruptly quit both the anti psychotic and anti depressant  months ago and now just take my mood stabilizer once per day and smoke a bunch of Pot  Havent been manic since and its awesome  yet my mom is convinced that Im constantly having some type of episode just because I might be tired or slightly agitated  Im the last person to play the victim card because I pride myself on my resilience  but it really does suck having seething resentment towards your mother when theyve done so much good things for you  but the bad stuff they do is so far beyond acceptable that these mixed emotions pop up  This is my first time posting on Reddit so I hope this works out  Stay safe out there,7975,1475

1381,p89mxk,0,4,Getting freaked out by partners family dynamic with his possibly vulnerable narcissist mother Things with my partner are generally pretty good  but im having a hard time figuring out and dealing with my his mother  amp  their dynamic  Shes neurotic  and overly sweet most of the time  However  the more time I spend with her Im realizing some kind of twisted things about her She is extremely self sacrificial  but Im realizing that she secretly is resentful if you dont foresee her needs and basically force her to not be self sacrificial  For example  she wont eat unless my partner demands that she does  weird because he is her child  and they are both adults   From what I hear  when he was very young he took on the role of caretaker with her when she was depressed and their was a lot of emotional incest as his father is an overt grandiose narcissist  She also talks a LOT of shit  About her children  their partners  really anyone and everyone  It makes me very uncomfortable because I know Im not  spared  from this treatment  She often positions herself as a victim in situations without much interrogation  Sometimes I also sense that if my partner and I are being  affectionate with each other she feels uncomfortable and possibly even a little jealous  Which maybe this is normal but  still not sure  I can tell that she has a fear of abandonment with her kids because they are her whole life  and feels threatened by in laws for this reason   Again  lots of conflation with codependent vs narcissist  It impacts my relationship with my partner because he acts more narcissistically around his family  He will snap at his mom sometimes which makes me uncomfortable because shes always SO sweet to him  to the extreme like my son can do no harm  As I spend more time with them it makes me turned off to my boyfriend because she puts him on such a pedestal and I see him eat it up  Its just weird and gross and Im not sure what to do  I dont typically feel this way when its just him and I  but maybe its easier to overlook things between us  Tl Dr  partners mom is either vulnerable narc or extreme codependent  and their dynamic is putting strain on our relationship,2205,384
1382,p89kxl,0,2,If and how to open up to my brother    who still lives with nMom and eDad Hi everyone  this is my    NC with biological parents for   years  first post after reading and commenting for a week  I hit some kind of rock bottom lately  Something I worked really hard for made it possible for me to really relax for the first time in my life  I have never been outside of survival mode and as wonderful as it is  I am becoming more and more aware of how much of a sprint  fight and mostly nightmare my life has been until now I am looking into therapy options at the moment and  I guess  taking quite good care for myself Even if I am NC with my biological parents  I am still and have always been in contact with my slightly older brother  I can not exactly explain the bond we do have tbh  We had a hate love relationship as kids  thanks bParents    but got quite close when he had cancer  He was   We got to be a team to  silently  support each other and live through all this together  After that the connection got loose as I left the house as soon as I turned   I needed space  Also had lots of feelings of regret leaving him alone We still saw each other from time to time  Mostly on birthdays etc  Since the pandemic we are seeing each other only as the team of siblings which is so cool  We even had some deeper conversations  but I get the feeling this is extremely hard for him as his circle of friends is more the type of party friends  As I got used to trusting people  opening up and talking about feelings with new friends I found  He does not feel comfortable talking about his feelings  but is able to open up a bit when he is talking to me  Otherwise he has a few topics he is just really into and loves talking about that non stop  which is very exhausting for me  At the same time I love people beeing geeks and learning weird stuff I am starting to think about trying to talk about our childhood with him  He is the only one who experienced the same reality as I did  maybe in a totally different way  Yet I can not even imagine his position as he still lives in that house  due to lots of reasons   Could be healthy for both of us or really bad talking about it Not sure how to approach it to be honest  Id love to at least tell him about me going into therapy this year  but I do not know how to approach that kind of conversation Maybe some of you went there before and you have some kind of advice for me  Thoughts on this much appreciated,2482,476

1423,p84hbl,0,2,My Nmum loves to make every thing about her and it drives me crazy  I will give to you guys two examples one of which happened today even thoe I could pretty much list more than that but it would get too long of I did Basically I have been mad at my Nmum since yesterday when she embarrassed me at the dentist so i keep telling her to leave me alone when she asks me questions  Here is the link to that post  https   www reddit com r raisedbynarcissists comments pdy i actually hate my nmum she lied to me and then So basically this morning when woke up around   I went downstairs to get the house phone to call my gp  I live in England so thats what they are called idk what they are called in  other countries or of you guys even have them  because I had this medical issue for the past two days that wouldnt go and the house phone wasnt working so I decided to call them on my phone and I decided to stay inviting room when calling them because I was tol tired to move of the couch  As I was calling GP my mum asked who I was calling and I told her the GP and then she proceeded to ask me a billion different times what was wrong and what my medical issue was and I didnt want to tell her because I was still mad at her and this women who is my mother litterly startred to cry when I wouldnt tell her in response I told her I dont have to tell you everything about me and she said that since she is my mother that no I do have to tell her everything and I just didnt respond and just spoke to the receptionist at the gp and she advised me to go to my local pharmacist for my issue I hung up the phone and my mum was still crying and insisting I tell her whats wrong and at this point she was annoying me so I just told her and then she was like what do you want for breakfast and i told her I dont want anything and to nonsense surprise she satreed crying again that I wouldnt eat anything  Btw my Nmum quite literally has an obsession with me eating and at one point it got too much and I even had a emotional breakdown over it  I will write this story afterwards because I want it to be its own separate post  And I just left and told her to stop crying since all I did was not tell her what was wrong me it at first and say I didnt want to eat any food and I dont think thats stuff to cry over And another thing my Nmum made about her is the passing of my uncle a month ago Basically sadly my uncle passed away a month ago and him and my auntie were pretty much the only family members I didnt hate and he was just amazing which is the opposite of his toxic daughter and my cousin And every since my mum found out and she would talk to someone about my uncles death or tell them that he is dead she would be would go from normal to balling her eyes out and then when she would hung up the phone she would immediately stop crying  there was only this one time she continued to cry after hanging up and I think the reason she did that was because me and my sister were in the same room as her and i think she wanted the attention to be on her  And my Nmum would even cry when on the phone to my uncles family aka my cousins and auntie and they were sooooo annoyed at her that they would immediately hung up the phone the second my Nmum would start to ball her eyes out And then my Nmum mum also cried infront of everyone at my uncles infront of his kids and my auntie and one of my cousins even confronted her and again I think the reason she did that was for attention Like Im not saying my Nmum isnt allowed to cry Im just saying after the whole crying whole on the phone and not crying after hanging up and only crying infront of people just made it suspicious Like even when me  my Nmum my sister and my uncles family went to see my uncles body for the first time since he passed she was the only person not to cry idk maybe she ran out of tears or something but if she missed him soo much that she would cry whenever someone was around why didnt she do it then it just sounds suspicious overall Do you guys think Im reaching with my second story and maybe turning it into something it isnt and being paranoid,4173,808
1424,p84dwn,0,177,My  year old floored me today with his emotional intelligence For context  I’ve recently gone no contact with my mother  who acts as the enabler to my father who was physically and emotionally abusive to me as a child  I haven’t spoken to him in many many years  but whenever this comes up in conversation with my Mum she acts surprised like this is brand new information  In other words  she gaslights the shit out of me This week she tried to get me into a situation where I’d have to have myself and my kids around my Dad and I put my foot down  told her enough was enough and never to contact me again  It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done  I’ve given her way way too many chances Anyway  as you can see  when I went NC  I said don’t contact ME  So what arrived today in our letterbox  A letter addressed to my  year old son  I asked him what his thoughts were and he immediately said ‘throw it away  I’m not interested in joining her army against you’He’s fucking  and he knew what she was doing better than I did  He was able without knowing anything about flying monkeys to see that she was trying to turn him into one It actually made a lot of the anger I had go because when people see and validate stuff when you’ve been gaslit your entire life it’s like someone giving you a blanket I do try and shield him from a lot of this but it’s difficult to know how to navigate stuff like this  The letter is gone  we didn’t read it or return it  My parents live in another country so they have had very little involvement in my children’s lives  I just hugged him and told him how proud I was of him  I’m in the UK but fortunate enough that I have access to private therapy which I’ve decided to pursue starting next month I’ve put a tag on for support because it’s been a while since I’ve had to deal with this stuff so I’m kind of a mess and success stories for therapy and going NC with an enabler narc would be appreciated,1962,374

1451,p7wwco,0,2,Is my mother a narcissist  TW  suicidal ideation  possible sexual abuseIm F  diagnosed with depression and bpd  I am quite sure my mother has bpd as well  especially since it can be hereditary  and Im aware bpd and npd tend to be combined with each other Throughout my life  she has given me the  tough love  treatment  I was the mixed race child w a man she never loved  so I suppose I always reminded her of that  She herself was a victim of abuse by this man and her own parents  generational things  different ways of raising kids  She often threatened both me and my younger sister  whom she may favor since shes not half white and is the daughter of a she loved  with abandonment  with one old family video depicting my mother threatening to send yr old me away  As for abuse  its mostly emotional but can be physical  I get most of the physical abuse  A few months ago my therapist called cps over an incident where my mother kicked me and tried pushing me down the stairs  Since then my moms gotten nosy abt my therapy and tells me what I can or cant say  and says shes now wary of me bc Im making a story to get her in trouble  fyi cps didnt do anything because it was a one time incident for them  A few months ago I was suffering from suicidal ideation  and whereas my mom cried for me then  now she says she only cried because she was depressed herself  and when I asked if she really wanted me dead  she replied with  are you threatening me   Though to be fair  during the cry session she said that if I committed suicide itd seem like she failed as a mother In fact  she is very much all about her appearance  saying that I should fix so so about my behavior because it reflects on her   What am I supposed to say to my friends when my daughter is lazy and useless   She also discourages my sister and I from ever telling anyone  family problems   I recall when I was   I broke down crying at school and went to the counselors office because someone told me that my mom never loved me  and I got triggered by that  I pretty much confessed everything to that counselor  it was my first time meeting one  When I got home that day  I told my mom what happened  and she yelled at me for telling  family problems  to the school counselor  I regretted telling her that  I regret most things I tell her Its not like were ever encouraged to tell her thingd anyway  Sure  she says  never keep secrets from me  Im your mother  but whenever we are honest with her we get scolded  And every conversation always deflects to her and her own pain and suffering and how we  the children  have to step up to help her  Were  too young  to have problems of our own  and yes  we acknowledge that she did grow up dirt poor and worked to send money to her family  but certainly falling back on that story every time doesnt justify it right She always tells stories about herself and makes herself sound so inspiring and whatnot  with the whole growing up outta poverty and being   open minded   yet she never listens to anyone other than herself  Shes homophobic  racist  once threatened to cut me off should I ever marry a black person  because  theyre  all witches    inappropriately sexualizes her teenage daughters   you look like a whore  maybe if youre raped youll learn   and puts them in danger Before vaccines  I once told her that we needed to leave her favorite restaurant because it was obvious that CDC guidelines for covid were not being followed at all  abd the place was packed of maskless people  She got super pissy and told me  what  are you afraid to die  my immune system is strong enough  even though millions have died  When she finally did comply  I later asked if she had hand sanitizer  to which she pulled her own out and used it but didnt share it with me  She gets her  science  from facebook  reptilian conspiracy theorists  and a preacher on youtube who claims people get sick because they left god  She also just    doesnt stop when we tell her to  She sometimes grabs our private areas in jest  and with me  Id told her multiple times I hate it when she compares me to my dad  a horrible person  or describes the US as  your country  or  your people here   for context  im asian american  not born in the us  basically raised racist against my white side   Shell be all sweet and apologize in that sarcastic tone  but she doesnt stop it  In this family  we never learned  no   I get the brunt of most of it  but for both my sister and I  shes never asked about our interests  our feelings  never cares for our pride and achievements  unless shes comparing us to a friends kid  and constantly expects us to read her mind regarding stuff like housework  which she never really taught us to do  properly   When we ask to be taught how  were criticized for not knowing  Aaaaanyway  I think thats enough writing lol  I didnt wanna just assume she was narcissistic because Im no professional  though i guess well never know since she hates therapists  but I know a lot of this comes from generational trauma and the poor parenting skills of back then  plus her abusive relationship with my biological father  Regardless  I know that shouldnt justify it happening to us  She uses it to justify her abuse  her  lack of control  but I guess I need to hear a second opinion  If you read all this  thank you for your time,5375,977

1457,p7vtqe,0,4,Emotional abuse is mind warping  and seems impossible to prove  Childhood trauma makes me feel invisible  long post  Typical helicopter parents  I was born early  almost  months  it was a horrible birth  emergency C section  mother was in a coma for  weeks and i was in the NICU for a little over  months  I got all the medical care I needed but i was underweight all my childhood due to very very low birth weight  and having been tube fed in the hospital  So why were they abusive  As soon as I could understand the words coming out of their mouths  I was told that i can trust no one  Take for example  my father is walking with me in Sears as a   year old   I cant remember the age but it was quite young  He always told me never wander off  never run away from him or someone will grab me  cut my head off and throw me in the river like John Walshs son Adam  who was taken from a Sears  He told me how that little boy was taken from a store like this  Okay  peanut butter story  I was a  delicate kid who struggled to gain weight  So  my dad wanted to force feed me  He asked me to eat spoon of peanut butter when i was young  I said no  because I didnt want to  He did not take kindly to my refusal and decided that if I will not eat it  I will wear it  He grabbed me and spread the peanut butter all over my face and put me in the corner  I remember the disgusting feeling of tears going through the paste on my face  It was gross and humiliating and I hated it because i just didnt wanna eat the peanut butter  As of a year ago maybe  he grabbed some peanut butter and a spoon  He tried to get me to eat a spoonful again and i just started screaming at him to fuck off because Im done with him trying to force feed me  He heavily contributed to the development of my EDNOS  eating disorder  hes shamed people all my life for their weight until it has wormed its way into my own brain  Hed say bad things even about my own mom  who is not thin   My  nice  grandmother has still joked about how i used to have a vice grip on her shirt while i sat in the cart when she took me to the store as a child because i was afraid someone would steal me away  They had their laugh but I didnt  My th grade teacher held a parent teacher conference once  as she thought i was being abused at home  I believe this was based of my startle response is  very  active  and i flinch at loud noises and sudden movements  i clarify  i was not hit  much  I always took slaps from my mom a couple of times  straight faced  I did face getting spanked by my dad but it was nothing to write home about  The thing that bothered me was I have hit my dad and he hit back but one time  i was in my room  We were fighting about something  and raised our voices  But he was getting into my personal space so I went to put my hands on his chest to push him away  not shove him or anything  but he thought i was going to hit him so he smacked me over the head  I backpedaled to go to my bed and he followed smacking my thigh and i was telling him to stop i didnt hit him i just wanted space  I was almost crying and said i just wanted my space  I was shocked and as i was backing up and crawling onto my bed  I was scared  I felt as though my dad lacked in the bonding department at some point and i didnt feel as connected to him  He made me a walking stick on a camping trip a long time ago and got angry with me and broke it in half in front of me  He fixed it  but its shorter than it was  Both him and my mother belittle mock me  A few days ago my dad helped me put on a tanktop in the kitchen  i was wearing a sports bra  and i never felt so uncomfortable in my life having him help me put a shirt on  My mother said Im like their little doll  When I was in Jr  High  i was told i wasnt allowed to go to a school dance  I went anyways  and didnt come home on the bus  When i didnt they freaked out  I got home and they yelled at me  but then they said to get out so i went around the house to go in the backdoor because they wouldnt kick me out  I ended up physically fighting my dad  and although i held out well  did not win and stayed outside  They said theyd keep me out all night  so it got dark and i watched the moon in this old shed that nobody bothered to upkeep  Dad gave me a sleeping bag at some point  so that was decent  I layed there and watched the moon until i saw a blinging light  It was dad with a flashlight telling me to get up and come inside  He told me they let me back in because theres some rapist on the loose  idk  I was glad to be back inside  I complained about this to a couple friends the next day and i guess someone reported it because i went to talk to a lady and she asked a lot about them  I now know that lady was a social worker  i was completely unaware until my parents expressed their displeasure at me telling people and getting them in trouble  I cant remember anything else right this moment  that was just the more significant moments  If I think of anything else  I might make a continuation in a comment  But yeah  it feels like lies  except now that I typed it all out  it sounds a lot more real than it did

1461,p7us6u,0,4,Cutting of narcissist parents  afraid of losing my siblings in the process    This is quite long so I apologize I’m flying home tomorrow with the intention of talking to my parents and giving them the ultimatum  acknowledge that my father physically abused me and apologize or I will end my relationship with them  No more holidays together  No more phone calls  Nothing  I don’t want to re hash anything or argue  I just want to hear those two statements  and then I can move on For context  I am late twenties  I was physical abused by my father between the ages of  and   I was the scapegoat  my mother knew and did nothing  and my siblings knew and also did nothing  To this day I “exaggerated what happened” or “remembered things differently than what actually happened”  When I tried to get help I “was trying to tear apart our family” and when I tried to get my mom to help me I was “the reason she almost filed for divorce”  It all ended abruptly for seemingly no reason and the few times afterwards I ever brought it up dissolved into screaming matches where I was labeled crazy I spent the last ten years going to therapy and processing what happened and how it has effected me and my relationships with everyone involved  We have all been civil  there have been no major problems outside of the occasional argument  I have no doubt that in their minds they convinced themselves that they’re right and I’m crazy or maybe even that they think that I moved on and forgot about it  But I didn’t I need them to tell me that it was real and that they’re sorry after gaslighting me for basically my whole life or I’m done  It’s not healthy to continue our relationship like this  But I know that they won’t give me that  they’re textbook narcissists  I’ve accepted that this is the end My only concern at this point is that I will also lose my relationships with my  also adult  siblings who I am very close with  They have always told me that I exaggerated the situation  They tell me all the time “they do so much for you  you should call them more    why don’t you come home this weekend they miss you    etc  etc ” Their relationships with my parents are fine and they are still financially dependent on them  Knowing them  they will take my parents’ side and that will be that I am wondering if losing them is worth getting the closure I want  I wonder if it’s worth playing into the charade if I can keep them around,2442,439

1464,p7ucyf,0,2,I hate when people say  your   youre an adult  you can do whatever you want  Sorry but I honestly hate when Im talking about my toxic and overprotective parents and people just say   your  your an adult  like bitch you dont think I know that   I know Im an adult but THEY DONT  When people say this I know theyve never had over protective helicopter parents  especially foreign parents   I dont speak for all foreign parents its just I noticed this trend a lot with them This is especially hard for me since my parents are basically funding my college and I litteraly live with them  I cant just move out  even though I technically can  Moving out would mean being cut off and not having any way to pay for my education  except taking a bunch of minimum wage jobs  and with my lack of expirence and being sheltered I wouldnt be able to make enough money and eventually ending up dropping out of college and in the streets  Prolonging something that couldve just been over if I just stuck with them and waited to move out  I dont want to be cut off from my parents I just wish they didnt micromanage my life  So waiting to move out just seems better  But this is especially hard when you have been entirely dependant on your parents and they take away anything from you that will make you more independent because theyll feel as if you dont think theyre good enough parents and that your  rebelling   Its really hard and stressful and not everyone has the energy or the strength to just move out  I know I sure as hell dont  Most of us who leave have no where to turn to when we do  so just moving out isnt a viable option  especially for a person whos just been emotionally drained from years of their parents toxic behaviors you cant just expect them to just pick up and go   its litteraly this or the streets  And Ill take hot meals over the streets  But I also dont think you should stay in a toxic relationship just becuse its convenient for you  So I think rather than just saying your an adult you can do whatever you want  People should start advocating for support systems becuse telling an abused person to just leave a relationship with someone theyve spent their entire life with doesnt always work  You need to find a support system first and people you trust to help you get out of that toxic relationship  Getting therapy or finding someone to talk to  Im  and Im still struggling and going through this  but having a support system for me like my friends have really helped ease the burden  Please for those of you going through something like this dont give up  and reach out  Yes our parents act as if they have this hold over us but they forget that we also have to hold ourselves up  Dont let them beat you down  Im proud of you and your accomplishments are valid  There is likely also someone dealing with it too  Dont put up with their shit but also remember that you still live under their roof so you need to find ways even the tiniest ones to get by until you do have the support you need to get out  If your too afraid to its okay find the courage somehow  If you ever need to talk my pms are open,3161,588

1475,p7t9j6,0,6,A few questions     Is victim personality a common N behaviour  Contempt for genuine victims  Leaving Ns company feeling drained of life  I am reasonably certain my father is a narcissist  He has exhibited many symptoms over the years  but has no formal diagnosis  I am posting this to describe a behaviour of his and ask whether or not it is something that is common recognised in narcissists  so I’ll just get in to it He has a real habit of making himself appear as the victim  Constantly  And when I say constantly  it is literally every other story he tells   I say story he tells because there is rarely any real conversation with him  rather just whatever personal story he tell that is remotely relevant to the current topic However  as much as he likes to paint himself as the victim  he is often overly and unjustly critical of anyone who has genuinely been victimised For example  earlier he was gloating about how he worked through the start of the pandemic  whilst painting himself as a noble victim of circumstance  He then went on to clearly criticise a colleague for working from home because of being classed as ‘vulnerable’  making quoted finger expressions as he says it  I asked him why he made that expression and for what reason they were vulnerable  To cut it short  it was asthma  and basically said it was a rubbish reason and they  people who were told to shield WFH  were just looking for time off work  When I challenged him on this  he remained blank and did not say anything  and generally speaking  this is his response whenever challenged about something unreasonable he has said that won’t directly end in negative consequence for him He also has a real problem with anyone our family knows who receives disability related benefits  e g  family friends who receive a car as part of disability allowance   It almost seems as if he’s jealous of people who are genuinely disadvantaged and have disabilities in life  The weird part is he has even gone as far as sticking a disabled sticker on his vehicle  and when I’ve asked him about it  he just brushes it off as ‘a joke’  It just feels so weird witnessing his constant attempts at evoking empathy for himself  but also the blatant lack of empathy for anyone else I’d like to be able to genuinely enjoy spending time in his company  but when the engagement has become nothing but a systemised and almost robotic sequence of retold stories to paint himself as a victim  I cannot spend much time in his company before feeling as if I need to leave  In fact spending too much time with him is draining   I leave feeling deflated as if the life had been sucked out of me  It usually takes me a good few hours to a day to recover from being in his company  The weight of his negativity just feels crushing I’m sure that what I’ve described is hardly anything compared to what some people on this sub are dealing with  but my reason for posting this is to ask whether or not the behaviour I’ve described is common or even recognised behaviour in a narcissist  If so  does the process of self victimisation have a name  Is a lack of response when challenging a narcissist a normal ‘response’ from one  Is it normal to leave a narcissist’s company feeling deflated and drained  as if someone has sucked the joy and spirit out of you  and if so is it normal for it to take an extended period of time to recover from this TlDr  Basically a few questions  Is it common for a narcissist to have a victim personality  Is it common for a narcissist to be overly and unjustly critical  to the point of appearing as jealousy  of disadvantaged disabled people  Is it common to leave a narcissist’s company feeling deflated and drained  as if someone had sucked the life out of you  and is it common for it to take hours to recover from this,3821,675

1481,p7ry32,0,20,I finally blocked my enabler dad  My mom is a narc with what im sure is BPD and life was constantly walking on eggshells waiting for her to be  in one of her moods again   She has no sense of boundaries  was emotionally and physically abusive  and abused my sister who has cerebral palsy  Often throughout life  I felt bad for my dad because he was the  nice  one  But whenever she got in one of her moods  he would just abandon us to go to his moms or drive around  etc    but now that im older  Im realizing that my bar is so low for someone who is  nice   Its not  nice  to sit back and watch your wife abuse your kids  Its not  nice  to hit a child with cerebral palsy  Its not  nice  to slut shame a  year old for her pajamas  Its not  nice  to abandon your kids when your wife gets in  one of her moods  and then pretend like nothing ever happened  Ive gone almost  years no contact with my mom  while staying in touch for the occasional  how are you  text to my dad  I finally today blocked my dad  It took me  years to learn what boundaries are  how to be good to my inner child  and get the inner strength to block my mom  Now  its my dads turn  The cycle is this  I calmly laid out the abuse i went through and stated my boundaries  that i would need an apology to ever be around my mom again  Despite saying this for over  years  my dad will text me every  months saying  hey we miss yall  when can we meet up   as if I never said anything  Then I repeat what I say each time  because I have sympathy that he lost a son  because at least he doesnt send my nervous system in fight or flight  that hes also a victim of my mom  etc  Today he messaged me to try to meet up for my birthday asking when  We  can meet up for MY birthday and i was done repeating myself  I was done of being told my voice is ignored and doesnt matter  It took me a long time to fully feel  not only logically know   that this is not right  Yes  I blocked my abuser  but if i tell you abuse i went through  and you ignore it  thats saying its okay to harm me  Its telling me my needs are not important  that my voice doesnt matter  I have nieces that I could not fathom treating the way my parents have treated me  If she came up to me and told me someone abused her consistently  I would not be okay with that person nor force her to be around that person  Having been treated like this  I spent most of my s being treated like garbage by friends and romantic partners because i was taught my needs dont matter nor my voice  And im just now ending the cycle  Anyway  just wanted to share this enabler epiphany,2627,517
1482,p7runk,0,7,I feel like a walking cloud of emotion lately and I hate it   Ever since my last blow up with my mother    I seen the narcissistic personality I was blinded by for so many years  Since then my emotions have been all over the place  especially since she hasnt called me yet after my Dad also reached out to her to her on my behalf   What hurts the most is    every day for the last  weeks I carry around a hope that maybe today shell call to try to mend our relationship and hear and understand why Im upset without getting defensive or making inflammatory statements  The fact that she isnt contacting me is becoming more hurtful and numbing at the same time   I feel like if I reach out to her shes gonna treat it as if Im done with my temper tantrum and all is well  I feel like Im holding back tears daily from all the realizations  of how my life could have been different if she wasnt so selfish  cold and controlling  I find myself wanting to overly share my thoughts and emotions with my wife surrounding my mother as I unpack how affected I truly am  I need to find a way to reign in these emotions  Im tired of being triggered by normal things that didnt affect me this way before,1214,228
1483,p7rmln,0,7,I dont even know if I belong here  I dont know what I am  All I know is that I need to escape and get therapy  Advice appreciated  Im sorry if this is a mess  Ive never been good at conversing I am always drawn to this sub through peoples stories  I always feel like I can relate to how they feel of escaping or at least wanting to  Yet I dont even know if my parents can be considered narcissists or they are just plain selfish assholes  but I need a place to vent Im almost out and getting away from my parents  A few months ago  I accepted a job offer in another state and Ill be moving  I am excited and sad at the same time  but I know I really need to get away for a while  These past fours years have been the most frustrating years Ive spent since junior high  Ive spent the recent years feeling lonely and wanting to spend the least amount of time in my parents place as possible  I only recently realized why I felt so lonely  A family friend  FF  came by recently to speak with one of my parents  P  and I shared the news that I was moving away  FF was happy for me until I mentioned that the other parent  P  doesnt know yet  When FF asked why  I explained that P had a habit of posting everything to FB without consent and despite me telling them several times not to post anything about me due to the nature of my work  FF and P kept cutting me off telling me that P was a good parent and that they deserved to know and to just tell them not to post it to FB  I was getting angry over the fact that they kept cutting me off like my own feelings didnt matter to them  P and I got into a screaming match in front of FF  This isnt anything new  P and I have been fighting over this for months  Its really ruining the experience of finally getting out and Im no longer excited for it Reflecting over that situation made me realize that no one supports me in this circle  Not P  not family friends  and not the extended family  with few exceptions   The only reason I feel lonely is because Im surrounded by people who support my parents over me  Its strange to say that I feel less lonely when Im by myself in a random place than when I am living in my parents place,2207,430
1484,p7rkim,0,5,Mom forcing everyone to drop everything and plan her trip Every single break we’d have  my mom would force the entire family to partake in an extremely burden filled “family” trip where no one enjoys  including her  These long ass trips consist of traveling all day  yelling  screaming  fighting  barely getting any sleep  repeat for a week or two  Our summer is basically ending and she started to cry and complain about how we “wasted” her break doing nothing  we had already traveled to two places within the past few months  and have another trip planned soon  and now she wants to go somewhere  She began to force everyone to sit down in front of a computer and plan the ENTIRE trip for her  the cheapest flights  the cheapest hotel prices  how many things were gonna do  while she sits and does nothing at all  She tried to make me do it  but I obviously don’t want to sit for hours and plan while she does nothing but complain  Because i dared to tell her “no ” she took my phone and wallet  allegedly my debit card with my money belongs to her   She fails to understand however that NO ONE wants to do this  and that we have breaks that we want to spend too  I’m forced to cancel multiple plans i had for the last week of break until my next semester starts because of her on the fly plan  I never thought that she was a narcissist  but her behavior within these past few weeks has got me curious  hence the post,1421,263
1485,p7reu2,0,5,Repulsed by the thought of kissing someone   Not really sure if sexual abuse is involved   Ive always forced myself to not want to be in a relationship from since I was maybe nine  Or younger because I never trusted myself to stay out of an abusive relationship because maybe I would love them too much to leave  influenced by my parents martiage  As Im healing  Im think I might have also been covertly sexually abused  I was neglected a lot and dont remember getting much cuddles that didnt feel like my ndad was sucking sympathy out of me but aldo realized how much I dont like the feeling of skin  or sudden hugs  I am repulsed by the thought of ever finding satisfaction of kissing someone  the thought of being naked with someone causes me to dissociate  I feel like my body isnt fir me to feel pleasure and only to be used by someone else and only get aroused when its a thought of potential r     The only thing I can think of that was sexual abuse maybe is when my dad constantly smacks my butt   not so much any more   he gets mad when I tell him to stop and says hes just playing and dies it even more  Hes said my butt is so soft once and when I was pretending to sleep he smacked my butt and then proceeded to call it a big  squishy  butt  When I was younger he was looking at my boobs   naked  that happened often   opened his mouth and proceeded closer to one of my boobs as if he was going to    but then my mom smacked him in the head and he stopped This is enough to be considered sexual abuse  right,1530,295
1486,p7re12,0,3,NMom loves to paint me as a problem child On her wall  my NMom has cards from both me and my sibling hung up  However  there is only one card each to represent each person respectively  My sibling has a card they write her for mothers day  complete with words of praise hung up on the wall  and I have an apology note I wrote when I was   Its been a long time since then  but she still has those two contrasting cards up to paint a limited picture of my sibling as the golden child and me as a problem  There is nothing positive about me  only that one note to completely represent my entire character Just goes to show what she really thinks of me  I guess,665,129
1487,p7r6jq,0,3,Mocked for being cautious Whenever i shut the front door or ask if it’s locked my parents get all patronising and say it’s all in my head  which is not true since i’ve researched the area and found that many people have experienced break ins  I just find it disgusting that they’re not taking anything seriously  they leave the front door wide open during the day  they are literally the only ones on the whole street who do that  and sometimes unlocked at night  i don’t even bother locking it because i know they will just go out and leave it unlocked again  They try to make me sound like this paranoid maniac for a simple thing like wanting the door locked  we also have dogs which have escaped so many times yet they still seem to not care  No idea what to do or say to them to take it seriously,801,152
1488,p7r2gt,0,16,I’m not sure if I should give my golden child  enabling older sister another chance  How do I know when to give up and move on  My  F  older half sister  F  and I have never had a very close relationship  The age gap certainly didn’t help growing up  but I thought that once we both became adults our relationship would improve  It has not  It has only become more turbulent  especially within the last few years  In short  my sister has almost always “sided” with our Nmom when she and I would argue  She’s always been willing to make excuses for her abusive behaviors  place the blame on me  and look the other way because she claims she doesn’t like getting involved  But then she and our Nmom will talk about me behind my back  and not in a nice way  It’s always seemed very gossipy and judgmental to me  but my sister continues to claim that they never say anything bad about me  Which is a lie  of course  I’ve had numerous conversations with my sister over the past few years about her behavior towards me and the way that she does not support or validate my feelings  especially when it comes to our Nmom  Every time I’ve confronted her  she’s promised to do better in the future and make more of a positive effort with me  And yet  she’s never changed or followed through on her words  Last fall I finally had enough and stopped reaching out to her  Of course  she had “no idea” what she did to make me “so upset” with her  Typical  Fast forward several months to the present  and she’s been waiting for me to contact her so we can have a serious discussion about our relationship  But I don’t know if I want to at this point  I’ve already made my feelings clear to her many times and have given her many chances to change  I don’t want to cut her out and end up regretting it because I didn’t give her another chance  but at some point enough is enough  I know it’s my decision to decide how to move forward  but I’d really appreciate some helpful advice,1977,366
1489,p7r1zi,0,6,Does life get harder for abused children after leaving  I know life is hard in general  and Im not saying making money is easy but since were already used to unnatural levels of stress from since birth is it easier  Im  and I cant fathom the thought that if life at home is this bad than being on my own will be x harder  I know people saying enjoy your youth or your time not having to pay bills usually comes from people that may potentially have a healthy home so the kids arent used to this level of stress or so my theory is  Its just being at home with an abusive father and an emom who didnt show enough care to my suicidal thoughts is so hard I think Ill die if it gets harder,698,138

1504,p7okkk,0,4,My mother died in june I am trying to come to terms with who she was  I am    my mother was  I have been living with AIDS for   which provides context  I am trying to figure out if she was a narcissist  I could not sleep last night because its like i am finally facing down the damage she did and trying to reconcile it  I had to keep it all pushed down in order to try to do the right things and be a a good daughter   Some of the many many things that stick outThe time  years ago  when my mother was still pretty healthy and she  with no self awareness at all  told me i had no idea what it was like to worry about my health all the timeTHE time when  AIDS meds had just come out and i had just started on them she sent me a letter saying that i had gained some weight and my husband would leave me if i got fatterThe mornings when i was a teen and she would scream and yell at me and call me a Horse’s ass  which was her favorite thing to call me  The when i would look upset she would make fun of me and say that i looked like a scared rabbitMy mother got pregnant with me at   People told her she should have an abortion  She loved to tell me how people wanted her to abort me and wasnt i glad she didn’t abort me All the times when i was a teen when she said that i must be a “tart” and all the times she told me i would end up spending my life working at McDonaldsWhen  my husband had his aortic dissection and was terribly deathly ill and my mother had slow moving cancer and she told me she was mad because he “stole her Thunder” She was upset because not all of the attention would go to her When i was a teen and got conjunctivitis and she decided i was a drug addict  spent  weeks berating me and and saying  “if it wasnt true you wouldnt be upset”  She then called in my brother the cop to lecture me  Finally she realized something was medically wrong and took me to an eye doctor  She never acknowledged her mistakeWhen she was terribly angry with me and told me i was a terrible person because I could not have her recover at my house after kidney surgery  I could not because i had  kids at home and would have had to give her my bedroom  at the same exact time as my husband was being released from  months in the hospital for and Aortic dissection and was literally bedriddenThe allotment i sent her for years while in the marines  that was never acknowledged  The fact that for decades  while raising  kids on a small budget I gave her a monthly stipend on top of paying her electric  cable and phone bill  Then despite my husband and i both having health issues but we had her come live with us for her final  years only to be called  irresponsible  selfish  rude  and a thief who made her feel like a prisoner I started working at  because we we’re poor and half of what i earned went to my mother to pay the bills  That was a lot of pressure on a teen  I dont begrudge this because it was needed   But it makes it hurt when she talks about how bad i am or fails to acknowledge the things we kids have done for her   The realization that out of  kids  I was probably treated the best  That at least  out of the  had way worse things said and done to themFor never  not once in my entire life feeling like my mother was someone i could go to to talk to about my own problems or issues because  everything was always about her  I never ever felt like i had a mother who was there for me in any way  In fact  i always felt nervous and literally scared when she was around  That she made sure  even in her last months  when i visited her in rehab every day that I knew where the notebook was because she wanted to make sure that I read it  She wanted to make sure we all knew how awful she thought we all were  My niece died on New years of   That morning my mother sent me a message berating me for not being friendly enough to her and for not saying Happy New Years  I Did not say Happy New Years to my mother literally hours after my niece died while plans were being made to remove life support  She in that same message said she gave up everything to move here  like she was doing ME a favor when she moved in She does not say one word about my niece  her oldest grandchild   in that message  I was walking around target yesterday to get a birthday card for my sister and i was checking the back to see if they were Hallmark cards  Why  Because god forbid you got my mother a card that wasn’t Hallmark then there would be hell to pay  The fact that i look at this list and think  maybe this is normal  Maybe this is not so bad  Maybe I am making a big deal out of normal small things For the the fact that despite this and a million other things i still love my mother and in some way miss her and feel guilty that i feel angry with her,4823,967

1512,p7nye7,0,4,Wondering when   if ever   I should reconnect with my alcoholic narcissistic mom My mom was an alcoholic my whole life  I always knew that  She got on and off the wagon a few times in my late childhood  Sometimes her sobriety was blissful  Sometimes it was nothing but tension and anger  The drinking was ALWAYS awful  though  In my early adulthood  I had to escort her out of a bar  in her pajamas  for assaulting a security guard  Ive had to answer police calls because she was getting a dui in the middle of the night  Ive attended many  family days  at rehab  Almost  years ago  I quit drinking myself  I had my own run ins with the law and quit at age   Im so lucky to have this much sober time  My mom and I were incredibly close when I was young  It makes sense now  that I can see her narcissistic tendencies  why we were so close  and that that closeness served her and her alone  Shortly after my son was born  my mom fell off the wagon HARD  A night of drinking ended up with her yelling in the street  having to be pulled inside  kicking and screaming  by her husband and my brother  I have not spoken to or seen her since that night  When I had a baby  years ago  my mother was not involved with my pregnancy  I made it clear early on that this was MY pregnancy  and she doesnt tend to find interest in things that dont surround her  My baby shower was hosted by friends  My mom refused to hold the baby the first few times she met him  Even before she started drinking again  she was incredibly disinterested in my child  If she came to see him and he didnt give her a big smile  shed insist  hes just not acting like himself today   maam    hes  weeks old   Im not quite sure what kind of advice Im looking for in this forum  Part of me is certain I dont want to talk to her again  Part of me wants to talk to her  just to tell her how disappointing this has been  She has not reached out to me  She wont  Im sure shes positive she hasnt done anything wrong My child is her only grandchild  She has never seen him walk or talk  Shes never heard his voice  I want to think that her missing that is  enough of a punishment   but I want to fucking scream at her sometimes  Again  not sure what Im looking for here  I just feel so alone as someone who lost contact with their mother to alcohol later in life  I dont know anyone else in my situation and god damn    it gets lonely,2430,464
1513,p7nqzb,0,12,nMom hurt me badly  I want to give her an ultimatum and could use some guidance TL DR  my mom thinks everything is about her  We recently went on vacation and claims I ruined it for her  that I dont care about her  and I learned she even tried to leave me at the airport without saying goodbye   Ive had enough  and I want to tell her to get help or we cant have a relationship  amp  xB Hi all  long time sufferer  first time poster  Some general background  I am in my late s and grew up with two nparents  different flavors of narcissism  who divorced when I was in my teens   My mom thinks everything is about her  which means she is easily offended by words and actions   When my parents divorced  she was left in a really difficult financial situation and she made a lot of sacrifices for us for which I will be eternally grateful but she never misses an opportunity to bring up her sacrifices and lord them over us     We have gone long periods  months  without talking to each other on two occasions  but have never explicitly addressed the issue because I know she wont take it well   I always end up going back to her   I have two younger siblings  siblingOne who recently moved out to live with their partner  and siblingTwo who still lives at home while they finish their degree   They also fight with her often due to her behavior   I have lived in a different state for the past few years which has made our relationship better because she cant involve herself in my life so much   but I will be moving back to our home state soon so I really need to establish this boundary   I recently just had an experience  which I will outline below  that was so outrageous and hurtful that I know I need to put my foot down   Ive been going back and forth between crying and feeling bemused by her absurdity all day   I will be having kids within the next few years and if I wait until that happens I know I wont have the emotional energy to do it   I dont want to risk her treating them the way she treats me   I want to send her an email  so she cant twist my words  telling her that her actions and attitudes have hurt her children  and she needs to finally accept that fact and work on improving her behavior or we cannot have a relationship   I want to recommend therapy as a tool   I want her to know that I love her very much but she has been hurting me my entire life and I cant take it any more or allow the same to happen to my future children    amp  xB So  the most recent event  siblingOne invited my mom  siblingTwo  and me to vacation with their partners family in a gorgeous tropical paradise   This is important to remember  because it means we were siblingOnes GUESTS   My partner was invited as well but wasnt able to come due to work   My home state is a big travel hub  so for both the arrival and departure  I had a connection in my home state and shared a leg of travel with my mother and siblings   We coordinated to ensure that we were on the same flights and sitting together   There were many behavioral things that stood out to me during the trip  and I tried to correct her in a gentle and private manner on a few of them  while letting others slide because I didnt want to deal with her reaction    Every time I did  shed get offended     She could not handle us occasionally having separate sibling time younger folks time  even when siblingOnes partners parents tried to plan separate  parent  activites  she would avoid and sabotage the  kids  instead   If she felt like we were  excluding her  by not involving her in every second of the day  she would try to insert herself   Sometimes  her strategy to insert herself is to chime in with a negative comment about one of us  your hair looks bad  that dress is too small  you have a zit on your face  etc    In these cases  Id tell her  hey  we are having a conversation sibling time here    She was constantly weird about money   We were guests and our hosts kept inviting us to things and paying without ever mentioning costs   This made her uncomfortable and shed start up awkward money conversations with our hosts which very visibly made THEM uncomfortable   I tried telling her in private to relax about  repaying  them  they arent asking us to pay  and if she cant relax she should have an explicit  private conversation with our hosts to say  hey  I want to make sure Im not taking advantage of your hospitality   Can I split the cost of the things youve paid for   and then shed know and could stop worrying   She never did this  but she did stop asking about money   Instead she pivoted to offering to pay for things in advance and even inviting them on a fancy excursion which was a great idea EXCEPT   After she offered to invite them on this outing and they accepted  she made it a point to let them know that she set it up and it was costing  XXX  but of course not to worry about it because we were paying for it   She was constantly putting down and nagging siblingOne   On one specific occasion they were late for dinner  held up by a storm  and arrived very hungry and stressed  My mom instantly started telling them WHAT to eat and HOW to eat it   Down to  cut it in half  put it on your plate  use a fork       SiblingOne was visibly distressed and I told my mom  Hey  they know how to eat   They seem very stressed  why dont you stop telling them how to eat     So she stopped telling them how to eat  only instead to start loudly commenting to the rest of the table about how they were eating wrong   Again  I asked her to leave siblingOne alone   In the cases where I had to ask her to behave in front of our hosts  I used our native language  which they do not speak  to avoid embarrassing her    She has no respect for personal boundaries  Exhibit A  I have started journaling again  stopped in highschool because I found out she was reading my diary   and I wanted to not slack on journaling while on this trip   Sometimes this meant I had to do it in front of her and she kept asking me to show her   I said no   She asks why   I said its for me   She got offended   Exhibit B  siblingOne had to purchase a swimsuit while we were out because they didnt realize there would be a beach there  There werent a lot of options so they ended up with a much more revealing style than they were comfortable with and they were shy and embarrassed about it   My mother and I were walking behind siblingOne  and she asked me to sneakily take a photo of their butt  I am  the photographer     I said no   My mom started to complain and ask me why I wouldnt do it for her   I told her I wouldnt do it because I know it would make siblingOne uncomfortable and I respect their boundaries  but if she wanted to go ahead and betray siblingOnes trust  she could go ahead   That earned me an exasperated  oh my god  pretend I didnt say anything     which is typical for her   She crosses a line and then either denies having crossed it or asks us to pretend it didnt happen   She disrespects siblingOnes comfort so often that they do not like my mother photographing them at all   Related to Exhibit B  at a later point we were at a beautiful beach  and I asked siblingOne if I could photograph them   I tried to do this without my mother noticing or being involved   They were so happy and comfortable posing in front of the camera  but eventually my mom saw and walked up and loudly complained that siblingOne would never let her take photos of them  so that siblingOne would hear and of course they immediately withdrew and became uncomfortable   At the airport waiting to depart  some paramedics approached a woman sitting near us to tell her she couldnt travel  something about the fact that while she was now covid negative  it has been too soon after her last positive test    We had been sitting near this woman for  minutes already  so if there was a risk of exposure  the damage had been done   My mother decided to very dramatically lean away from the woman  and into my seat   doing nothing other than making a scene considering that moving   further away wasnt going to make her any safer   So I told her  hey  stop leaning into my seat    She got angry and told me to stop being so rude   and I should let her lean   I said she wasnt any safer leaning and was just calling attention to herself  and if she feels unsafe she should move to an empty seat farther away   She responded that she was there first  so I said  fine  take my chair then  and I got up to move farther away so she could have my seat   This  apparently  was the last straw of perceived disrespect for her   there was a lot more that happened on the trip but this is already long enough as is So  as we boarded our flight  I chatted with her a bit  or at least I thought I did  but she wasnt really engaging with me   We were in the same row on the flight  but siblingTwo was between us  so we didnt interact during the flight   When we landed in our home city  my mom rushed off the plane before most people had even stood up from their seats  and she dragged siblingTwo off with her   SiblingOne  their partner  and I  didnt manage to get off the plane for another several minutes   We expected to see them waiting for us at the gate  but instead they were rushing down the hallway towards Customs   It has been years since Ive come through my home city on an international flight  so what I didnt know at that time was that we would have to split up at customs  as there are different lines for connections and final destination arrivals   We were confused why they werent waiting  so we ran after them   Eventually we reached the point where I had to split off and my mom  looking very unhappy  and siblingTwo were standing there waiting   I said my goodbyes and made the rounds hugging everyone  prioritizing my mom  but she was very cold and her face and body language made it clear that she did not want to hug me and she didnt make an effort to return the hug   I went my separate way  amp  xB An hour later  I learned from siblingOne that once they were in their line  my mom had a  dramatic moment  saying we ruined the vacation for her  because  we acted like she couldnt do anything right and only  partners  parents were the good part  and she said  I should never go on vacation with my children again    Fortunately it seemed like siblingOne wasnt too bothered by the display but felt awkward since this was in front of their partner  and they knew that nothing they could say that wasnt a complete lie would make her happy   They pointed out that this vacation is not unique and these sorts of disagreements have always arisen on past vacations together and ignored her further complaints   So I apologized to siblingOne that they had to deal with that without me there but I was glad that they werent letting our mother get what she wanted  which was to try and spoil their trip in the way she felt it had been spoiled for her    We lamented that she was so dramatic but I wasnt too upset about it until today   This morning  I reached out to siblingTwo  because they live with her and I know how our mother can be  persistent and relentless   I worried that they would become the target for her unhappiness since they were alone with her   SiblingTwo told me they were fine  and that they were refusing to talk about about the issue with her because she was being ridiculous   Thats when they told me that she was  hyper fixated on what you did   ie  telling her not to lean into my seat  and that she said  OP doesnt care about us  and that she   tried to rush through the separation point at customs to avoid saying goodbye     SiblingTwo argued with her that she was being ridiculous and forced her to stop and wait for me   They asked me to let siblingOne know about this  since they hadnt talked about it yet and was exhausted from dealing with our mom   So that was why she ran off the plane and didnt wait  because she felt so slighted by me giving her a social correction that she wanted to leave without saying goodbye   And when siblingTwo tried to make her stop  she said that I dont care about them   The fact that she could say that I dont care  after all the behavior from her that I put up with and forgive  and all the uncomfortable things Ive done to make her happy    I cant believe it   Last January her father died in her home country  and I dropped everything on a dime to purchase an expensive flight to be there for her and help her sort out the funeral because no one else would   She asked me to do the eulogy at his service because she didnt have the strength and I wrote and delivered it   She even BRAGGED about my beautiful eulogy and how much I helped her on this very same trip  only to turn around and tell siblingTwo that   I dont care about them     And to top it all off is the absolutely outrageous behavior of trying to run away in the airport to avoid saying goodbye   I feel like there are very few  if any  things a person could do to deserve being abandoned by a travel companion like that   Especially a mother to their own child   Its such a crazy thing to do that I honestly find the behavior concerning  but not more so than I am hurt by it     So thats the long and short of it   I want to send an email  addressing her trying to run away and talking shit about me to my siblings   I want to address her behavior and how it affects me   And I want to tell her she needs to change her behavior  ideally by seeking professional help  or we cannot have a relationship because she has hurt me too many times and I cant keep that energy in my life   I myself will be seeking therapy to talk through the damage she and my father have done because I clearly have a lot to unpack   But I need to set this boundary NOW and I have no idea what the best way to write it will be   I am giving my siblings a heads up about this  especially siblingTwo since they live with her  and letting them know that they can stay out of it if they are most comfortable that way and in that case  if she tries to bring it up to them  she will  they can absolutely say they dont want to talk about me with her and to stay firm   I worry most for siblingTwo in this scenario    amp  xB Thank you so much for any help and advice you might offer me,14392,2759

1515,p7np4t,0,12,Considering showing my Nmom videos about narcissists so she can see herself Last night I got into a huge argument with her and it went how it usually does  I say some trauma that she has done to me in my past and she immediately says “I didn’t do that” “I don’t remember that”  So it’s like… instead of taking the person’s word for it… your child… that they have the memory… you just deny them any consoling or apologizing  Like it doesn’t matter that you don’t remember it    You did it and now I have ptsd and a bunch of other issues   Like my issues didn’t pop out of no where  And as soon as I say my trauma she has to come back with “well you were a bad kid so that’s what happened”  But it’s not even with the past my mom does this  she does it mid conversation  She will say something and I’ll ask for clarification of what she said  or repeat exactly what she said back to her and she will be like “I didn’t say that ” “That’s not what I said ” Then it will go into an argument of how my perceptions of her are wrong  she is into life coaching  and I’m seeing her through a filter of my past  But whenever she says something about me it’s the truth and I can’t deny it and it’s not a filter  But then when I tell her she denies my truth  she says that of course what she said about me was through her filter  And it’s just this huge back and forth about what she says and what she didn’t say and something that was true five seconds ago isn’t true more and no amount of talking it though will ever work  She will just deny deny deny everything I say and then be confused why I’m still upset  Since she is so into self help and life couching I want to show her a video of what narcissists are and how they act and their tactics so she can see herself  But I’m so scared that she will just use what she learns and accuse me of doing it,1846,367

1525,p7mnnd,0,2,Running away from home   Im sorry  thisll be quite long So Im posting here because my parents have toxic tendencies  including most probably narcissism For the past year Ive kept telling my mom I wanted to move out to be closer to university when school starts  Ive said a bunch of other reasons too  but Ive never said anything about leaving because of them A month and a half ago I brought the subject up again  and she refused to acknowledge it completely  But that didnt stop me from still planning my move  signing a lease for September  etc  Four days ago I told her again that I wanted to move and it was scandalous  She said horrible things to me like Im incapable of doing anything on my own  that I hate them and the rest of the family  that Im ungrateful  that I have no rights and that she wants me home where she can know everything I do  Among all her crying  she also said that she doesnt think Ill ever speak to her again if I move  and that she forbade me to move  Didnt understand why I  didnt understand  why moving wasnt allowed     And that if I leave  she wants this years tuition money back  I didnt even have the chance to tell her that I signed a lease  so I believe she thinks she won this round  She barely talked to me since then  only this morning did she say something remotely nice  Theres still some tension in the air I think  she probably has a feeling something is up  My moving date is on Wednesday  If I tell her the day before that Im leaving no matter what she says  itll create scandals and I wont be allowed to take furniture  etc  Even though its an option  its a lot of hassle so I was thinking of just leaving while my parents are at work and be able to keep my furniture  Id leave them a letter explaining the same thing that Ive explained before  and that Im certain that Im ready and that I hope eventually my mom will understand  Also adding that we should not communicate for a while  except maybe email  and that afterwards we could think about doing calls and visits  Obviously Ill block my parents and family friends everywhere  so no one will be able to guilt me or say some nasty things  As for the moving  Ive already packed and moved most of my belongings  I only have  boxes and furniture left to take  We have a h window on Wednesday to move  pieces and undo my bedframe  Since well be  people  I think it might be doable  Having  people load up the truck   people on the bedframe  and  people moving the rest of the things  helping me pack the last two boxes  Im still hella worried though  because what if one parent stays home that day  or comes home early  And whats my mom gonna do  Shes unpredictable  I changed shifts at work so in case she hunts me down  I wont work my usual  And everyone will be safe at work  And then what  I take a loan for school  no biggie  But then what if I cant live with roommates  Its my first time  And what if my mom never speaks to me again  quite ironic because thats one of her biggest fears  Its in the top  biggest things Ive ever done in my life  but I dont feel much about it  Except that Im goddamn fearful of the unknown Any thoughts,3207,600
1526,p7mkla,0,6,I think moving back with Nparents has made things worse  I moved back in with my Nparents last May after graduating and it has really messed with my mental health  I made so much progress in therapy while I was away but now I’m back to disassociating  barely eating  mild hallucinations  etc  I was on my way back from a job interview today and got into a wreck on the tollway  I didn’t even know how I hit the other person’s car  I think I was disassociating again  I’m terrified of doing that again and hurting someone and I plan to see a therapist about it  I’m just afraid of getting my license taken away because it will be harder for me to find a job and move out  I really feel that if I wasn’t living with my parents right now  my mental health wouldn’t be so bad and I wouldn’t be so scared of this happening,820,158

1528,p7mfg3,0,2,Need advice  Been with my narc parents for  years now when I should have left  What should I do now   Fixed my post  Im mad at myself for not sticking to my principles and accepting their bad behavior  But I had no outside support  lost contact with all my high school and college friends  and no money saved up  So I stayed with them after knowing what they did was wrong  Here is a list     Lied about my college arrangements    Moved to a different state  I ended up losing my car  my computer  my video games  lost the chance to be with the girl I was in love with  and I burned through my    saved up because of their lies and broken promises  After staying in a dorm for a year  they broke their promise of allowing me to stay in an apartment and sent me back to the dorms  This was all done on purpose to control me  I soon became depressed and dropped out       Kicked me out of the house and made me homeless    unless I begged for forgiveness   After a road trip thinking about things  I confronted my mother in a kind  reasonable way saying     You know  youve always acted like there was something wrong with me  But I was never broken inside  I was fine the way I was     She then starts to scream at me like a crazy person and demands my house keys and says Im no longer allowed in the house  So I took another long road trip from Arizona to Florida  I ended up living with my grandpa in Texas and working for my aunt for a bit and my grandpa ended up driving me back to my parents  We never talked about that day     Constantly locates me with my phones and lies about it    About   years ago  Sprint had the family locator program  Since I was on their plan I would get a text message saying   You have just been located   When I confronted my parents about it they said   They just randomly send those to you   It doesnt matter how admit I am about the fact they JUST locating me  they give the same answer that they didnt  Honestly  I think this hurts the most  How can you treat someone like theyre that stupid  Even when I started to pay for my own plan  somehow I still that message when I left to Vegas without telling them     Pretended some girl who liked me  who I didnt like  was my girlfriend to the rest of the family    I was in church and   my mother introduced some girl to my grandma like she was my girlfriend  I even told my mother not to do this  The girl even played along  I didnt want to cause a scene in front of my grandma  so I was just quiet  I was thinking to myself  What the h ll is going on here      When I told them I was getting treated badly at my career job  they told me to ignore it and just work there for  years cause I would make a lot money    I think anyone who cared would tell you to find work somewhere else   I worked  various hourly jobs before that  so it wasnt just employees giving me a hard time  Im familiar with that  This was straight up abuse     When my brother was stealing my food  clothes  and   bills out of my wallet  they wouldnt confront him about it    They said you have no evidence so they wouldnt confront him  When I confronted him about it  he physically assaulted me  I called the cops and had him arrested  Then everyone in the family took his side     When I confront them about the past  they either wont apologize or say they dont remember and say  thats in the past  and to  get over it    I was a straight A student who my teachers and peers liked  I did all the extracurriculars and was accepted to all the colleges I applied to  So why the h ll would you start doing this to your son    I guess it was a control thing since they could no longer legally tell me what to do once I was  and going to college  That and a reputation thing since I was quiet  I feel like quiet to them equaled being less than everyone else as youre supposed to be perfect in every aspect including being extremely outgoing  And also a reputation thing that I didnt have a girlfriend yet despite having fallen in love with a girl in my hometown that my parents moved away from  This is the real problem    I cant stop thinking about this stuff   I wish I could move on but I cant  Unfortunately  I stayed with them for the last  years and drowned myself in self help to avoid the truth of my situation Actually  its been  years   year old going to college to now a soon to be  year old  since they started to treat me this way    is when I gave up on my career job and started to study and write self help and when I considered just leaving the whole situation      For the most part  the way they treated me came out of NOWHERE  I think thats why it hit me so hard and why Ive been trying to fix the relationship   And it seems like people in general are angry at me for staying with my parents and not working  I think thats also why I became a TI   I feel like thats an entirely different situation  but I also feel like its worth mentioning    I hate myself for staying there I need to move on  but the only way I can think to do that is to cut them out of my life So I have two options     Work while living with them and slowly move away      Just leave with what little Ive got  The problem is    Ive kind of tried both options already   For number one  I finally got my dream job while living with them  But every weekend when I had nothing to do and no one to hang out with besides my parents  I felt extremely empty inside  The job was ultimately unfulfilling because of that  and I ended up leaving  Then I  joined  the self help world industry which does seem to fill the void to a point  But I think it was just escapism from my real problems For number two  Ive  ran away from home  several times  several different ways since I was   I just never had that much money saved up when I did it   Never had more than that    saved up since college  I think my unhappiness causes me to spend money on things  I used my car to sleep in while I went to California probably  times  Couldnt get used to it  Tried to bike across the county three times and then tried walking across it twice  Gave up and went home every single time  Stayed a week at a Nevada hotel and at a California hotel to start my life over  Didnt work out  I cant think of all the ways  but Ive always gave up and came home I really dont know what to do with my life anymore  Im just out of an abusive  year narc relationship with my other grandpa  went back and forth between living with him and my parents  thought he was my ticket out of there  no idea he was also a narc till  years into it  but now Im permanently back here with my parents   What should I do now     P S    I think part of the problem is I do get along with my parents   to   of the time  My mom and I are pretty good friends  My dad and I are very much alike so I can relate to him  We live in a nice area and they always have good food to eat  Its hard to be angry enough at times to do something about the situation  I feel like Ive been lulled into comfortable resignation prison,7130,1345

1533,p7m0y9,0,3,Gaining the courage to move out  m  Dont really know how to start this  but here goes my rantA while back I told both of my parents that I was planning on moving out when I had enough money for it to be a safe decision  At first  my mother blew up on me and told me that I was an awful and immoral person for doing that to her and that I should instead stay with her in her trailer to pay her bills  Her house is falling apart and its never been the best place to live  so I was super resistant to that idea  I posted about that whole mess here a while back and thanks to some kind users i know realize just how strange it is  So  flash forward  Im staying with my dad now but things arent much better to be frank   I simply dont have much of a life here as my dad expects me to be home whenever I can  Even then  its hard for me to do much as he gets upset with me whenever Im in my room alone  With all of that being said  I desperately want to move out and be an independent adult  However  my dad told me that he wants me to stay  for at least a year  or stay with him indefinitely  I fear that both of my parents are going to blow up on me should I decide to move out and its so hard to gain the courage to  just leave   I know I sound very whiny but this stress has been over my head practically all year now  Would I be awful for moving out before the one year mark  Should I even worry about that  How do I even negotiate this with my parents,1463,304

1535,p7lohu,0,2,Nparents and therapy CW  descriptions of unhygienic living space and s icidal ideation  along with brief mention of enabler parent but not their specific actionsMy Nparent is  reasonably  fearful of being mandated to work in person at a k person government workplace where masking is not mandated  testing is voluntary  and everything is self reported  I support their decision to not work there  for sure  However  something really hit me hard about the lengths they went to try and not have to go to work in person  First  some background though because otherwise its a stupid situation but not as  Nparent  in quality Ive had severe depression and anxiety since I was a tween  related to struggling through school as someone with an undiagnosed learning disability with no support or access to help  a stressful home environment  and being faced with a lot of academic pressure as a high achieving student  My parents and other adults in my life didnt notice anything was wrong  or do anything about it beyond chastising me for being  gross  or  crazy   I was so depressed that I left a pile of stuff on the floor that my ailing cat peed on for months  was scared of telling my parents that the toilet got clogged again so I left the clogged toilet for two weeks until the smell got too bad  my parents used to blame me for having  too big of poops and clogging the toilet  as if I could control my fecal matter   my bed was entirely covered in stuff so I had a sliver of room to sleep etc  It was really really bad I couldnt access therapy until the end of college  when my enabler parent agreed to cover the cost of therapy after I couldnt get out of bed for two weeks  Enabler parent found me crying in bed and came to comfort me  while Nparent made disparaging remarks and guilted me for being depressed  treating the s icidal ideation I was experiencing as the attention seeking lie of a dramatic teen  Im in my s and have struggled for a decade  When I started therapy  Nparent made dismissive and judgmental remarks about  every kid these days needing counseling   As you can tell  this parent has never cared about my emotional or mental health  only my production of good value as an intelligent and successful person to boost their ego  They laugh at me when I cry out of frustration sadness being overwhelmed  since childhood   made fun of my weight and gaslighted me about it when I confronted them about how it made me feel  childhood onward and would still now if I wasnt thin   and have been tearing down all of my aspirations since I was an older teen  saying Ill never be successful unless Im a doctor  engineer  or professor  It changes depending on Nparents mood  Sorry for the long background but it stings even more because of this history  To avoid going to their workplace  Nparent went to therapy for two sessions  contacted a psychiatrist  and got a medical letter claiming an inability to work in person due to mental health  They claimed  everyone should go to therapy   that its great  and then told enabler parent and me about their therapy sessions  I was just    Laughing on the inside  I had no energy to be angry about this  They havent gone to therapy since  But Im still so    Miffed    that they used therapy for the manipulative gain  and then acted like they knew everything about therapy and its values after two sessions  Im disgusted  Anyway thanks for listening yall  Any of you have similar experiences,3492,597

1537,p7lieo,0,2,I turned  yesterday  my dad got me a letter begging me to come home  Things have gotten a lot better with my Dad since I moved out  hell my life has gotten a lot better since I moved out  Hes not a total narcissist  he has many narcissistic traits but I am lucky I can maintain a solid relationship with him when there have been times I would have gone no contact with him in a heartbeat  Still my stomach dropped when he couldnt get through the first page of the letter without a bit of cheeky parentification  some self victimisation and reminding me of everything hes sacrificed and that he views where I am now as a failure and a struggle It was so nice at first  but it just had to take a turn  Sorry if this upsets you  but Im your dad  will always be your dad and its not unreasonable for a dad to ask that time and again I resent many of his word choices  I try and read them from his perspective as an honest articulation of his feelings and thoughts  because god knows where else hes putting shit that honest out there  there are things he tells me he says he cant even tell his own wife I just wish he could talk about this  come home  shit just once and also acknowledge any of the reasons I left  Its not unreasonable to ask  but its unreasonable not to make an effort where Ive said it counts  Many things have changed in the past  years  but that  year old kid he told to leave  he told would never be called by his real name  then flipped his script and begged to come home knows that when he came back  nothing was really all that different  Fast forward to when Im   I explained very clearly  I explained why I was moving out  my reasons  in depth  I was transparent with them  I gave them weeks of notice after months of telling them I was planning on moving out at said time  They gave me a bombardment of vicious messages  hours before I got picked up with my stuff  my parents stonewalled me for a bit after I moved  The only person who accepted my  No  Im sorry but its not that simple  I cant just stay   and saw me off was my younger sister Does he think about my conditions  when he talks of the conditions of my return  Theyre the same as they were when I was   Ill come back when you go to therapy  Each year  at every opportunity I beg   Ive seen enough therapists  he says  not one of them being for his own issues except a short lived attempt at marriage counseling that he and my mother stopped once she suggested divorce  In fact part of why I moved out in the first place was to freely seek out therapy  something he had always sought to control to make sure no one was  encouraging her confusing   When I moved schools    s he cant see the counselor or join any programs without me being informed   When he found a letter referring me to an endocrinologist from our family doctor he took it without my permission and hid it in his wardrobe  I had been without psychological or regular psychiatric support for more than a year  an untreated BPD diagnosis that exploded under the pressure of that environment  and an attendance rate that was so low my father was getting warning letters that legal action may be taken against him  Every single meeting  I told my teachers I needed therapy  My dad told them hed arrange it  Id follow up on it  Nothing  Nothing since I refused to see do a program based on family therapy when I had my own psychological needs I was focused on  and that program didnt match them   I gave you the chance  you didnt want it I just feel so fucking unseen  God  what the fuck has all my honesty been for if hes just gonna fucking cry alone about it in his car  I have celebrated so many achievements since I moved out  moving out has been my greatest accomplishment  Everything Ive done since I moved out  each success  he does not celebrate the way he honours my  failures  with his tears I just wish theyd come over more  Were in lockdown right now so they cant  but my mother has never even seen my place most likely because shes not allowed to use his car or under his instructions  the car he bought for my sisters  My oldest sister has driven me home a couple of times but shes never even seen the place  I want them to see how it is  how nice weve made it  how proud I am  When did he forget When did he forget all the times he disappointed his father by honouring himself  Why cant he connect the dots and see hes projecting part of his unresolved issues with his father and fear of breaking social expectations onto me  Does his family even know Ive moved out  Ah well  I know he pushes me away when he is panicked  Hes scared hes lost me because hes lost his legal power over me  He fears Ive been as strong in my convictions as he knew I was all along It is painful  but this is his version of love  This is what it looks like  I am so loved by him though  so loved  When I can break through his walls and we can laugh and talk and spend time with eachother its so nice  Moving out has given me the power to back up my boundaries with consequence  I no longer have to put myself in situations I am not comfortable  One day we will love eachother more healthily  If only he could accept all of me  the way I have been told I must try to with him my whole life,5313,1000
1538,p7lhzr,0,5,nParent Disowned Us M here  recently my father was caught cheating on my mother for a rd time  He then proceeded to tell my mother that she was a useless bitch   even though he doesnt have a job  he threatened to make her  rot in jail  and that he was going to make sure that she was left with nothing in her life  I decided to stop talking to him and he knocks on my room asking me why I refuse to talk to him  I then told him that he had said fucked up things to my mother and that I was cutting contact with him  He then tried to make me feel guilty by saying    I hope that it isnt too late when you want to talk to me again   implying that he could die or something  He also said that this was a fight between my mother and him and that it shouldnt concern me  He told my mother that he didnt consider his two daughters as his anymore  he said that I was in the  middle  because he saw that I was growing distant from him  What do you guys and gals think about this  Does he meet the criteria for a narcissist,1022,209
1539,p7lglv,0,13,Should I feel guilty  My nMom is really stressing me out over a mini grand piano she got me off this neighborhood app for free  I feel so entitled and selfish for even considering it a stressor  but all it’s doing is causing complications in my life  I’ve played piano since a teenager  for fun  I learned from youtube tutorials and cannot read sheet music  I have a keyboard that I barely take out because it occupies too much space  Whenever I see a grand piano in public  I play it for fun and enjoy it  they sound beautiful  I sometimes say things like “I love playing grand pianos whenever I get the chance” or “It would be so cool to have one of these” NOT in a literal sense  It would be cool to have a lot of things  ya know  So  she found it for free  but she’s paying hundreds of dollars to movers so it can be delivered to my living room  I share a house with  other housemates and have to move their stuff to fit this mini grand somewhere  The landlord is having the floors remodeled soon  the piano is getting delivered in less than  weeks  I’m planning on moving out by the end of the year and will have to pay people to move the piano to wherever I go  Whenever I tell her it’s stressing me out and I didnt ask her for it  she says things happen for a reason and she remembered me asking for one  and that this is a great opportunity for me  She told me to tell my landlord to hurry up with the floor and tell him about my piano  but I don’t even really know the man  I have pretty bad anxiety and all of this is stressing me out a lot  It might even work out fine  and I’ll be happy in the end and she’ll get her fix being the person who provides happiness  Idk  I just want to not be dealing with this all right now,1747,345

1551,p7k82c,0,2,Take advantage of the surrender tactic When  it comes to a narcissist  they have huge egos  a weakness that can be  exploited  You might not be able able to escape from the narcissist  due  to either financial or logistical reasons  This is the source of most  of their power  This is a post on how to deal with them for the time  being for maximum gains What  I recommend is adopting a strategic approach when it comes to dealing  with them  Give them a false sense of security  Its okay to lose  battles if you eventually win the war  These battles or better yet   losses  usually end up being having to abide by their  rules   deferring  to their authority  or giving them a feeling of control over us   Nothing wrong with any of this if it will be beneficial to you in the  long run  I know its silly  as if Im telling you to not have  boundaries but I want you to look at it as trading space for time  Let  them think they are winning  when in reality you are secretly advancing   in this case  working towards your independence   According to Sun Tzu   When you are weak  make your enemies think you are strong  when you are  strong  make them think you are weak  when you are in retreat make them  think you are advancing and when you are advancing  make them think you  are in retreat  The art of deception One  way to do this by not arguing with them  no displays of anger  I know  they can really piss one off but if they are in your presence under no  circumstance should you show that you are pissed off  because for one   it achieves nothing and doesnt help you at all in your eventual goal of  escaping  Two  it lets them know what makes you tick  which is valuable  info to them for future purposes  Last but definitely not least   arguing is taxing on your mental health Understand  that the narcissist wants you depressed and running in circles  They  will try to start petty battles all for the sake of mentally  exhausting distracting you  Never justify yourself to them  if they  criticize something you did  ignore them  they are trying to get you to  explain yourself  as if youre somehow guilty of being human  They do  this to start arguments and also to maintain their  holier than thou   image  giving you the illusion that they themselves are perfect As  you know they have huge egos  You must exploit this whenever you can   Give them the feeling of victory  thats all they live for after all   Feed their ego by agreeing with them  asking for their opinion on  something  the news is good for this   dulling your talents or by giving  the appearance of finally devoting yourself to their cause  themselves   It might be hard to do this  but the hardest things usually have the  best returns of investment in life  They will stop being hostile   aggression is usually fueled by more aggression and when you stop giving  them fuel  which is why I must stress the importance of not engaging in  arguments with them  never show that you are angry   they will leave  you alone  giving you time and mental fortitude to plan your escape from  their toxic regime  There is no shame in surrendering to fight another  day  Better that than to be a martyr  pertaining to narcissistic  parents  this might mean being kicked out or being physically assaulted   You might live in a democratic society but let us not fool ourselves   narcissists are dictators  You are the country under a colony but on a  much smaller scale Another  instance where you might want to employ your cunning is whenever they  pester you with questions  Not all interrogators wear uniforms  Conceal  your intentions by giving them false information  If you say nothing at  all are being secretive  it will alert them that you are on a defensive   making them unpredictable  an undesirable outcome  Ive seen people  mention grey rocking on here  based on my understanding  it involves  avoiding the narcissist or giving them very short responses  Take it  further by employing the strategy I just mentioned  remember  you want  them to think you are on their side Now  if youve done all of that successfully  the narcissist will leave you  alone  Suddenly youre not mentally drained from pointless arguments and  can now focus all your energy on making money  They say money cant buy  happiness but it definitely buys freedom  a prerequisite to happiness   Develop a framework to start earning money  I must put emphasis on this   focus on making money  it is the key to your independence  It could be a  job or selling whatever skill you might have  as long it makes you  money  Save aggressively  If you remember what I said about being  pestered with questions  youll know to deflect with false information   It might be impossible to conceal a job  but its not hard to tell them  youre earning a figure much lower than the actual one  Money is power  in its purest form and will give you the ability to say  fuck you  to  anything in life  the ability to walk away Ive  seen posts here that suggest moving out  which I agree with  moving out  should be priority number one but some of them fall short on the how   Hopefully this can be a guide to some on what actions they can take that  towards achieving their independence,5248,987

instead    I can recall a time he bought a house  me and my sister came to visit he stated the next time we come he will let us decorate   I came to visit the nd time around and he had a lady and his  kids in the house with their room decorated  I had to share a bed with them    that hurt and I cried a lot    fast forward   I am moving with him now to a whole different state alone at    this time around I move in with him his new wife and  kids    it was weird to me how he could have a whole other family and just not even be able to talk to me    since I already didn’t know him well I remember constantly just sitting in my room and never coming out   I peed in a cup and washed clothes in my tub   as I started high school I played sports and got along with people well    my freshman year my dad eventually got deployed so I had to stay with my new step mom  which cause me to rebel but nothing major  I’d just hang after school longer sometimes and not tell where I was at  My dad came back my sophomore year and I struggled with my grades which made him eventually angry  He took my phone and went through messages  he seen me and my friends messages   We were really just being teens we cussed a little  he had an outburst and flipped my whole room which scared me and resulted me to want to go back home   Mind you we still don’t have much of a relationship or talk  I figured he was just disciplining me as a parents   Moved back with mom  she bribed me with things to get me to stay  Eventually my grades weren’t up to par  my moms husband intervened and took my phone and told me I couldn’t contact my dad    when at this time I was supposed to go visit him for holidays  I eventually began to bump heads with my mom because she let him control not only me but her    I had to leave     went back to live with dad   he is now divorced  never tells me why  but now I come back and my dad is single again so a lot of the times now I was resulted to being home alone my dad went out so I just eventually started to hang out with friends   and do my own thing and this was my senior year of highschool so I got some leeway    I remember one day getting a call while at school mentioning that my mom had been beaten my her husband   i became very furious   my mom didn’t leave and i gained some hatred towards her and stay away from her home for awhile   eventually after I graduate which is    I’m working and having fun and on the go and really my dad is to  We don’t ever see each other    this is our new normal    we did have sit down talks from time to time but they were like long life lectures nothing reasonable  I remember Jan   I get a call from my sister saying that my mom has been beaten again and I grow angry and a lot of anger for her husband but she doesn’t leave    mind you this man has never apologized and my mom gets angry at us for being angry at him    I just become such an angry person    a little later   I began to date a guy who was emotionally unavailable and used me for sex  got me pregnant had an abortion  i paid for it alone  had nobody there for me not even the guy  amp  never told anybody    I feel because I had nobody he really comforted me  despite how he treated me  I continued to date him  pay for his stuff and everything  I was manipulated and didn’t know  Eventually I got tired and decided to leave but he continued to beg me to stay so I did  Later finding out he was having sex with  other girls and one also had an abortion   But that didn’t stop me I still dealt with him it was hard to let go    about a year later I ended up pregnant again and had another abortion and I just felt horrible and spiraled downhill   my mental health dropped a lot   I stopped having motivation to work   became an alcoholic  used drugs  my self esteem was down  started losing friends  I looked for validation within men so much  I let them use me for my body thinking it was ok    I grew way more distant from my dad and angrier with him because he was right there but couldn’t even tell  I eventually became suicidal and started to confess it to my parents because I was scared and got sent to a mental hospital  Within that time I had therapy appointments but refused to go  had to take medicine but refused to take it because I was scared to become addicted    now I just am at an all time low   my dad gets angry for me always staying in my room  And we start to bump heads to the point that we eventually got into a physical altercation   I take a break go to my moms for a week and I was very low and sad    I didn’t talk or eat I lost about   in  month    her husband approaches me and asks why I don’t love him which results to me having an outburst throwing things  amp  explaining to him that he’s beaten my mom  He laughs in my face   amp  my mom doesn’t do much  She just ask what did I do to help the situation    few months later aka now my dad kicks me out for a month until finding out I’ve been in a car accident and been sleeping in my car  He let me back in but now I’m just  really insecure   I’ve lost many friends  haven’t been able to maintain a job  and have so much still going on  It’s hard for me to because I’ve lost trust in a lot  In myself   I feel like I’ve became narcissistic or selfish or something  I’ve lost friends  My parents have never apologized to me about the abuse and a lot of stuff just has to get swept under the rug  I know this is long and This is not even it all  I’ve dealt with so much and now i don’t know how to deal with the real world  I am scared  my siblings go with the flow and I just can’t  I want to move out   away   amp  on and be independent with life but I cannot seem to let go of alot  I am  now and currently cannot continue to a therapist for awhile  I really try to pull through  I don’t understand what’s wrong with me and idk what to do,7852,1576

1554,p7jv0c,0,4,Finally went NC    I finally blocked my parents for good about a week ago and it feels amazing  I have put them on time out temporarily blocked them before but this time I have no hope of us reconciling and I dont want to try  I was sick of continuing the cycle of abuse and I want to be done with it for good and never go back  I had so much guilt leading up to it and thought I would have so much guilt after I did it  I did have some guilt at first but I just reminded myself of why Im doing it and it is mostly gone now except for when I hear from some flying monkey siblings  Mostly I feel so happy  free  relieved  peaceful  relaxed    I truly feel like a different person  I hope I can keep it up  I plan to  I just wanted to share in case anyone is on the fence about going NC  come to the bright side  it is so much better over here Thanks for listening  much love to all,889,179
1555,p7jmev,0,3,My nMom has had multiple affairs and expects me to keep her secret from my dad  who I love very much  I dont really post  so Im sure its got errors  but I just needed to get it out My m step dad married my f mom and legally adopted f me when I was five  and it was probably the best thing that could have happened to me  My mom is a raging narcissist  but covers it pretty well in public  and just shows it privately to a few of us  lucky  family members  mainly my step dad and myself  She cheated on my step dad probably  years ago with my biological dad  and it was a mess  They separated  I hated it  Then she realized she was going to have to actually work if she didnt have financial support  so she went back to my step dad  For a while there  she  found Jesus  and I think she mellowed out a little bit  but around her th birthday  something snapped  and she decided that she was going to do what she wanted  screw everyone else  She left my dad to run an extremely demanding business by himself at   yrs old  while she visits  best friends  or  works  hours away  and Im left to help him on my days off  after working all week This has been going on for years  and Im done  She never suffers any consequences to her actions  Im tired of running her business  while lying to my dad and pretending I dont know anything about the multiple affairs that she has had and then outright told me about  She thinks I empathize with her because shes  bored  He deserves better than this  but I dont think I should have to be the one to tell him  Hes almost  years older than she is  and I think he is afraid of being alone this late in life  but wouldnt you want to know  Wouldnt you rather be alone than with someone who cares nothing for you  How do I resolve this without putting myself directly in the middle of it  Its causing me severe anxiety and depression and I am just ready to scream it at the top of my lungs and walk away Ive started writing a letter  but I dont even really know where to start,2044,388

1559,p7jfs6,0,4,My mother gets a kick out of provoking me and then revels in my frustration In my st year of college  but at this point  I’m close to moving out  This has been an issue pretty much my whole life  with her complete inability to accept responsibility   even to my dad  as he revealed  or apologize even when the evidence is clear as day  My dad  working through the summer  is frequently gone from the house  which leaves me alone with her when I’m not working myself  During these days  I have been locked out on the back porch and told to sleep outside  because I came back  minutes late  have had my possessions stolen from my room   amp  many other negative interactions over the course of the summer   only getting worse   Today’s incident was relatively minor  though her reaction definitely aggravated the situation greatly  after spending the night at a friends house  I returned home to try and get back some sleep  as I hadn’t slept very well there  As soon as my mother hears that I am attempting to rest  she immediately bolts downstairs to get out her instruments  we are a musical family  in order to wake me up as loudly as she can  I later find out that she had absolutely no reason to “practice”  her justification   and the only reason she was even playing was in order to get me as angry as possible  When I realized this  I go downstairs to ask her nicely to consider “practicing” later  to which she returns a smirk and the classic narcissistic laugh  indicating she felt zero remorse and even enjoyed watching my visible frustration  Following this  she begins blatant gaslighting  “you sound crazy  you look out of control  etc” This kind of thing happens constantly and she seems to be getting worse and the summer winds down  It’s never been this bad  and I am currently wondering what I did in a past life to deserve this  She is  and acts like a dramatic th grader  I partially understand  seeing as her childhood household was chaotic  but it’s more than obvious that she knows full well what she’s doing TLDR  my mother calculates specific ways to get under my skin  and then delights in my reactions,2135,380
1560,p7jem8,0,3,Im afraid that the path Im headed down is going to kill me  I need someone to talk to   TW  To preface  I know this may not be the most appropriate sub for this  I do have NParents  but this is more of a support seeking post for all of my issues and not just that one  since I dont think I could separate them even if I tried  Im a little bit desperate to be heard and to find someone to talk to so I hope its okay to post here this once  since itll be seen by more people than any related sub I feel so completely broken that Im not sure where to begin in asking for help  I have been through things that I would never wish on anyone and Im running out of ways to cope that wont put me in the ground  When talking to a friend stopped working years ago  I turned to self injury  That stopped working  so I turned to flat out denial  From there  it became promiscuity  And then drugs  and then alcohol  and then more severe self injury and now harder drugs  Im realizing that Im going to die if I dont help myself  and despite many years of suicidal impulses and fantasies  the thought of dying on any terms other than my own is terrifying Ive been through many professionals  I have a loving boyfriend and one or two patient friends  No family  though  And I think the two things that I desperately need  which have been missing from everything Ive tried and failed to find comfort in in the past  are  a  a person who understands on a personal level because theyve been there  and  b  a person who has that whole maternal  protective thing that Ive never gotten to experience  I cant recall a time in my entire life that Ive felt protected  even as a young child  and I think it may help me give a shit about saving my own life to believe that Im valuable enough to someone to be worth protecting If anyone at all feels like talking  I would be very grateful  I just ask that you be woman identified  non religious  and non judgmental of the things Ive had to do in order to survive  Ill also leave a heavy trigger warning here for severe child abuse  of all types   rape  self injury  suicide  and substance abuse,2143,396
1561,p7jc2l,0,6,I hate living here  sorry if this is incoherent So two days ago  i wanted to have some olive oil for breakfast then dad yelled at me for taking another bottle than the one he wanted me to  So mom told him it was fine then he yelled at her that its none of her business and to shut up  Mom is  and hes  So mom packed her clothes and went to her parents house and the next day  he bought himself breakfast and didnt get any for me or my sister  there was nothing to eat at home   So we took a taxi to stay with mom  And then he took the car to his sisters home  shes very toxic  misogynistic  and hateful towards mom  And he didnt call me or any of my siblings  He has no health issues except diabetes and when he got it he blamed it on us  and so he started yelling at us everyday  Mom has huge health issues yet she does all the housework  he treats her like his maid  calls her stupid and hes never happy neither with her or us One day I asked if I could drink a cup of juice we had at home  and he told me no since we already eat too much  I dont eat a lot at all   whenever I try to fill my water bottle  hell tell me I should leave the water for him  Whenever I eat in front of him  he glares at me  Were not that poor  we have a big house and can afford basic things at least  In March  I wanted to go leave and live in the streets  he didnt hold me and watched her fight with me because of him and he was laughing  its always the same silence treatment method since Ive been a kid  he would just watch me beg him to talk to me and cry for that  and he would tell me to go away and that I am worthless and all that even if I get the best grades and do all he wants  When Im sick  i dont go to a doctor  and i dont have pocket money to do it myself  Ive been suffering from deficiencies all this year and they only took me to a doctor when i had one month left for the exam I still remember one day he stopped talking to me and my siblings all at once for NO reason and when mom tried to intervene  he started with the  i CaN lEaVe tHiS hOuSe iF yOu wAnT  Now Im here at this house  having nowhere to sit alone  with kids yelling everywhere and no right for privacy  I cant even take a shower and I dont know if theyll divorce or not  and even if they do mom will probably blame it on me,2328,478
1562,p7j1gp,0,3,Need advice  Been with my narc parents for  years now when I should have left  What should I do now  Im mad at myself for not sticking to my principles and accepting their bad behavior  But I had no outside support  lost contact with all my high school and college friends  and no money saved up  So I stayed with them after knowing what they did was wrong  Here is a list     Lied about my college arrangements    Moved to a different state  I ended up losing my car  my computer  my video games  lost the chance to be with the girl I was in love with  and I burned through my    saved up because of their lies and broken promises  After staying in a dorm for a year  they broke their promise of allowing me to stay in an apartment and sent me back to the dorms  This was all done on purpose to control me  I soon became depressed and dropped out       Kicked me out of the house and made me homeless    unless I begged for forgiveness   After a road trip thinking about things  I confronted my mother in a kind  reasonable way saying     You know  youve always acted like there was something wrong with me  But I was never broken inside  I was fine the way I was     She then starts to scream at me like a crazy person and demands my house keys and says Im no longer allowed in the house  So I took another long road trip from Arizona to Florida  I ended up living with my grandpa in Texas and working for my aunt for a bit and my grandpa ended up driving me back to my parents  We never talked about that day     Constantly locates me with my phones and lies about it    About   years ago  Sprint had the family locator program  Since I was on their plan I would get a text message saying   You have just been located   When I confronted my parents about it they said   They just randomly send those to you   It doesnt matter how admit I am about the fact they JUST locating me  they give the same answer that they didnt  Honestly  I think this hurts the most  How can you treat someone like theyre that stupid  Even when I started to pay for my own plan  somehow I still that message when I left to Vegas without telling them     Pretended some girl who liked me  who I didnt like  was my girlfriend to the rest of the family    I was in church and   my mother introduced some girl to my grandma like she was my girlfriend  I even told my mother not to do this  The girl even played along  I didnt want to cause a scene in front of my grandma  so I was just quiet  I was thinking to myself  What the h ll is going on here      When I told them I was getting treated badly at my career job  they told me to ignore it and just work there for  years cause I would make a lot money    I think anyone who cared would tell you to find work somewhere else   I worked  various hourly jobs before that  so it wasnt just employees giving me a hard time  Im familiar with that  This was straight up abuse     When my brother was stealing my food  clothes  and   bills out of my wallet  they wouldnt confront him about it    They said you have no evidence so they wouldnt confront him  When I confronted him about it  he physically assaulted me  I called the cops and had him arrested  Then everyone in the family took his side      When I confront them about the past  they either wont apologize or say they dont remember and say  thats in the past  and to  get over it    I was a straight A student who my teachers and peers liked  I did all the extracurriculars and was accepted to all the colleges I applied to  So why the h ll would you start doing this to your son    I guess it was a control thing since they could no longer legally tell me what to do once I was  and going to college  That and a reputation thing since I was quiet  I feel like quiet to them equaled retarded as youre supposed to be perfect in every aspect including being extremely outgoing  And also a reputation thing that I didnt have a girlfriend yet despite having fallen in love with a girl in my hometown that my parents moved away from  This is the real problem    I cant stop thinking about this stuff    I wish I could move on but I cant  Unfortunately  I stayed with them for the last  years and drowned myself in self help to avoid the truth of my situation Actually  its been  years   year old going to college to now a soon to be  year old  since they started to treat me this way    is when I gave up on my career job and started to study and write self help and when I considered just leaving the whole situation      For the most part  the way they treated me came out of NOWHERE  I think thats why it hit me so hard and why Ive been trying to fix the relationship   And it seems like people in general are angry at me for staying with my parents and not working  I think thats also why I became a TI   I feel like thats an entirely different situation  but I also feel like its worth mentioning    I hate myself for staying there I need to move on  but the only way I can think to do that is to cut them out of my life  So I have two options     Work while living with them and slowly move away      Just leave with what little Ive got  The problem is    Ive kind of tried both options already   For number one  I finally got my dream job while living with them  But every weekend when I had nothing to do and no one to hang out with besides my parents  I felt extremely empty inside  The job was ultimately unfulfilling because of that  and I ended up leaving  Then I  joined  the self help world industry which does seem to fill the void to a point  But I think it was just escapism from my real problems For number two  Ive  ran away from home  several times  several different ways since I was   I just never had that much money saved up when I did it   Never had more than that    saved up since college  I think my unhappiness causes me to spend money on things  I used my car to sleep in while I went to California probably  times  Couldnt get used to it  Tried to bike across the county three times and then tried walking across it twice  Gave up and went home every single time  Stayed a week at a Nevada hotel and at a California hotel to start my life over  Didnt work out  I cant think of all the ways  but Ive always gave up and came home I really dont know what to do with my life anymore  Im just out of an abusive  year narc relationship with my other grandpa  went back and forth between living with him and my parents  thought he was my ticket out of there  no idea he was also a narc till  years into it  but now Im permanently back here with my parents   What should I do now,6700,1262
1563,p7itei,0,63,I was suicidal and checked myself into a psych ward several times last year  which is being used to call me  unstable  in court  and used to say my  abusive  parents need to keep me trapped under conservatorship   Basically the title  but I need to vent below   The first time I felt suicidal and was scared Id act on it  I tried to reach out to my parents for help  but they didnt take it seriously  So I checked myself into a psychiatric ward voluntarily so Id get help and wouldnt impulsively commit suicide   Then I went into Outpatient  and sent an email to my mother standing up for myself and setting a healthy boundary  My mother made a passive aggressive Facebook post that day  basically using FB instead of directly responding to me  She shared somebodys post that said  if you dont heal what hurt you  youll bleed on people who didnt cut you   tagged me and said  I know this   Because this post was my mothers subtle way of rejecting my boundary and claiming  I  was the one unfairly bleeding on  her   because I was tagged I felt publicly humiliated   and  because I had a history of cutting as self harm in the past  which my mother  knew  about   this triggered me to feel suicidal and want to kill myself with a razor  I felt frightened I wouldnt be able to keep myself safe  spoke up  and got ed again   The last time I got ed is because my mother abused her powers of conservaotrship over me  and it was my breaking point  My mother has medical conservatorship and access to my confidential records  She got access to my trauma informed therapists confidential records and discovered I dislocsed her abuse to this therapist  and this therapist believed me  My mother then used her medical power of conservaotrship to pull me out of therapy  without warning me or the therapist  She also pulled me out of psychiatry because the psychiatrist I had was co workers with the therapist   This frightened and devastated me  These professionals were the only ones who recognized I had PTSD due to my mothers abuse  everyone else my abusive parents hired for me basically gaslit and invalidated and mis diagnosed me   I realized that as long as my mother had medical and confidential records powers  Id never get trauma informed therapy with competent therapists again  because my mother would simply pull me out of therapy like she did with that team  And that as long as she had this power and control over me  id see therapists and psychiatrists whod continue to gaslight and invalidate me over my parents abuse and maybe even my PTSD diagnosis Yet the fact I was brave enough to get ed and reach out for professional help is being used to call me  unstable  in court  The court investigator himself believes this and said because Im  unstable  he believed my parents should remain conservators and I shouldnt be allowed to petition to end the conservatorship Yet theres no acknowledgement that the reason Im so unstable felt suicidal is mainly  because  Im going through conservatorship abuse and narcissistic abuse  and suicide felt like my only way out  And with them saying me getting ed makes me unstable  I feel Im being sent the message the next time I feel actively suicidal  its apparently better for me to just risk killing myself instead of recognizing the danger and reaching out for help  I dont care if they mean to send this message  this is the message Im getting loud and clear  and it upsets me  pisses me off  and feels dehumanizing Yet suicide awareness suicide prevention  advocates  doing what I did  calling a suicide hotline or telling mental health professionals if youre actively suicidal  even if that means getting hospitalized  I did what anti suicide campaigns  claim  is the  right thing to do   but its being used against me in court  How fucked up is that,3867,649
1564,p7ioet,0,3,The most painful is to see that they are happy  and that they will never give a shit  because life actually always favouritises evil Im just depressed as of now  Ive had multiple narcs in my life at the same time  Family  friends  and every partner so far  Now for a while all the fake friends and abusive partners have been cut off   have left  Family ones are still there  but I have a safe person to flee to in case things go haywire again  I cannot give more details for my own safety  but at times my life nearly got threatened But now  I am observing from afar those people  And I just see them enjoy life  They literally never have any problem  Despite being stupid and evil they never get sick  they never have accidents  they never lose a job  Most people they interact with actually side with them when our matters are concerned I just struggle now  To know that there wont be any justice  They wont ever pay for what they did  If anything  I am now       certain they will actually bury me first  They stole all my fuel  let me an empty damaged wreck  and now they can just go for the next target  while I will probably never recover  I had been abused in my childhood by many people  but they were strangers  so actually now  I dont care  Strangers cant hurt me anymore  One more bullet  or one less  does not make a difference  But family   friends      I still cant digest it  The betrayal     is just so high  Its unbearable     I just stay because I dont want to hurt my few real friends     can anyone relate to similar stuff with narcs  I post here  because the ones who wounded me the most  are my parents  They were the first  of many narcs that came after them  each one shelling and inflicting damage,1746,321
1565,p7ilgc,0,5,Recovery as an RBN is a slow bumpy road but Im so proud of the progress were all making  I was looking back at some old diary entries  I never used to journal as a kid because nmom one time found my diary and read my entries out loud to the whole family  sniggering the entire time  but as an adult it has been very helpful   I read an entry I wrote in the  pre enlightenment  era  when I didnt realise how toxic my parents were and was so sad to see some of the stuff I wrote in there  I was telling myself to open up to my mom and connect more to her  blaming myself for her unavailability and her critical nature where she weaponizes anything I say that makes opening up to her not only impossible but also UNSAFE   I had such bad fleas  where I felt super jealous of my sister for getting private tennis lessons whereas my nparents actively discouraged me from doing sports  infamously  nmom told me the day I told her I wanted to join the track and field team   You will quit in a couple days    dumping my resentment and anger about the whole situation on my sister rather than my nparents  where it truly belonged  And now  about   years later   Im still on the journey to healing and actively working on processing a lot of stuff from my childhood  but I am so  so much better  I am so much kinder to myself  The inner critic that my parents installed in me from an early age is softer  When it starts criticising me  I tell it to shut up  I am kinder to other people than I was before  because I dont dump unresolved anger and resentment onto them as often  I wanted to make this post to encourage all of you out there who are feeling hopeless  who are feeling like fleas will never get better  They will  Give it time  give it energy  Give it lots and lots of therapy  Healing from the wounds our nparents gave us is not easy at all  and I think of all the accomplishments in my life  the amount of progress Ive made on healing is definitely   Youre making progress  Youve got this,2007,380
1566,p7ijxz,0,25,Does financial control ever end  My whole life  F  has been based on threats and discouragement  Every time I accept a “gift” or financial help from my ndad  there’s always a catch and that’s to do what he says  When I suggest something not according to his plan for my life  he makes sure to tell me how bad my life will be  And it’s all under the guise of “knowing what’s best”  I have to return to work to afford moving out  but he says I can’t do that based on an ‘agreement’ we had  I dont remember being told that if i accepted the help with paying off a loan  I cant get any job outside of what my parents say is acceptable  I need income to move out  He knows that  “Well  we’ll just help you with any costs you can’t cover with what’s in your bank account now  Don’t spend any more money ” I don’t want him to help me with moving because the cycle will just continue  But I have to leave for my mental health I can’t set boundaries  I can’t grey rock or do any therapeutic shit because it never works  I’m steamrolled by my ndad and my possible nmom just sits and watches  It feels like I will be financially controlled for the rest of my life,1159,223

1572,p7i1re,0,11,My mom used my siblings and I to get famous our whole childhood and exploits us now  Growing up my Mom was always trying to be rich and famous  She would make my siblings and I write letters to tv shows to try to get her on  We had to package  address and mail her latest get rich quick idea often throughout our childhood and she called us her little worker bees On summer vacations she would have us wear a t shirt to try to sell her product  Our family vehicle was also constantly decaled with her product She did not have a regular job so it always felt like if we didnt support her latest get rich quick idea we would be even more poor  Sometimes she would donate thousands of her product to try to get publicity leaving us even more poor than we were Later as adults   family trauma occurred and she convinced that family member to write a book about it  She guilted everyone into our family and to writing a chapter and then tried to get us all to go on Dr Phil and exploit the situation further so that she could become famous She somehow has the belief that if other people think shes a good person theyll give her lots of money and shell be rich   Im only now realizing this could fall under narcissistic She doesnt meet the exact definition of narcissist  does anyone know what this diagnosis would be,1328,245

1574,p7hv8b,0,2,No win situations with Narcissist or Toxic Parents Family Members  Non stop shame  guilt  and self hatred  and feelings of helplessness I apologize if this post sounds enabling  invalidating  or excusing narcissistic abuse  I just feel really helpless right now  as I feel that my parents toxic behaviour is doing a number on my sanity  despite me trying to emotionally detach and improve myself in a healthy  constructive  and empathetic way  In this post  I just want to rant and vent about my situation  as I have a very enmeshed and dysfunctional family which I dont know how to articulate with words  but i apologize because i do not mean to sound like i am excusing toxic behaviour or insulting  blaming  and generalizing about groups of people My malignant narcissist father punishes me for emotionally detaching from his narcissistic bullying  or for simply showing cognitive empathy for other people  Yet my malignant narcissist dad has the nerve to justify his self absorbed  egomaniacal behaviour as  the way it is   that his behaviour is somehow the way the  Real world is   or somehow my fault for not  letting it go   Therefore  every interaction I have is a lose lose situation  if I play along with his narcissist bullying  gaslighting  self absorption   and love bombing  in order to keep the peace with him and get him off my back   i feel like I am internalizing and justifying his toxic behaviour  giving him more power over my self worth  and letting his fucked up view of the world determine my life  But if I choose not to care what he thinks by grey rocking him  he acts victimized while antagonizing me at the same time  criticizes me for supposedly  being spoiled  or  not doing anything   or he tries to control me even more  While nothing would please me more than cutting my ties with him and his toxic family  I am afraid of the social fallout  simply liking therapy posts on Instagram is enough to wound my fathers ego  and not being friends and liking his toxic family members posts is also enough to slight him  as my dad cares about sacrificing my mothers  my sisters  and my own self respect in order to make himself look  altruistic  and  selfless  to his psychopath family members  Ironic  because my dad is a self righteous  insecure  mentally unstable  delusional  narcissistic piece of human shit  whom thinks hes entitled to destroy the happiness and dreams of his own family members    and unfortunately moving out is not an option for me as of now  as i do not have enough money and mentally i feel like my dad was right about me  not being able to handle the real world   being confident is not an option as my dad mocks me for doing so  but he acts like an unstable psychopath if i stand up to him and call him out for it  and emotionally manipulates me for not talking to him if hes my friend  I just feel so conflicted because whenever I have emotionally broke down and put myself down by apologizing and insulting myself for being  worthless  or being  mentally broken   my narcissist dad would  build me back up   this always felt manipulative and just to bolster his own delusional ego  saying  youre not worthless   but if I tell him I feel like Im always digging myself a hole  then hell say  well then stop digging    I cant have normal conversations with people because my toxic parents insist on me and my sister talking to them as if theyre our friends  yet if we dont talk to them like theyre our friends  theyll act offended without admitting it  While I appreciate being provided food and shelter by my parents  Even though I rationally believe that this is a minimum requirement and not a fuckign excuse for toxic behaviour  my dad frequently buys me pointless gifts in which he uses to control me emotionally by pretending that my identity is like that and getting offended if I disagree with him  weirdly enough  he used to  not like it  if I thanked him when i was younger by saying to me  were family  we dont need to thank each other   Yet  nowadays  he acts entitled to me thanking him in a scared  childlike tone of voice  as he acts threatened if I do not thank him for him doing shit i can either easily do myself or for doing things I never wanted him to do for me  I do not want anything from him  yet he loves to pretend that I am spoiled  If I thank him in a confused or unenthusiastic tone of voice  although im lucky he doesnt rage as often as he did when i was younger  he gaslights me by saying that if i am in a bad mood i should take  natural supplements   The worst part is  I dont know anymore if my dad is right  seeing how due to my cowardice to stand up to his fucked up behaviour back when I was a teen  I always sound out of touch  overly apologetic  childlike  and hypersensitive whenever someone talks down to me  laughs at me  or angrily criticizes me  but I dont want to turn into my toxic dad or toxic mother to cope  Although I feel sorry for how my malignant narcissist dad and his family treat her  I feel that she does not give me healthy feedback at all  she either infantilizes me like a fucking baby who cant do no wrong and lovebombs me  pressures me for  not telling her everything   acts offended if I simply speak normally and confidently  or she gives really passive aggressive  unclear guilt trips to shame me  Without admitting it of course   My mother runs a home daycare  in which she treated me like a golden child in front of the other kids  which always made me feel deep shame seeing how despite her caring about their physical wellbeing  she never had an issue with shaming them  emotionally manipulating them  and emotionally abusing them  Although Ive tried to show the kids there compassion as much as Ive could  I hate myself for being too much of a coward to report her  due to being afraid of  disrupting the peace  at home  I cant call out my mother  as she frequently acts as if Im oppressing her if im merely trying to stand up to her toxic actions  I feel sorry for my mothers lack of confidence  abuse she went through  and low self esteem  but i do not sympathize with her toxic behaviour towards her daughter and to the kids she takes care of While my sister does validate some of the toxic behaviour my parents have done  such as my fathers mentally unstable  psychopathic  and narcissistic rages  my parents racist and sexist insults or  jokes   my mothers emotional abuse of the children at her daycare and of her daughter  some of my fathers weird gaslighting remarks   my sister unintentionally excuses my fathers and mothers narcissistic behaviour  gaslights me  gives me contradictory feedback  if i beat myself up and put myself down when talking about negative interactions with people  shell give me supportive but constructive feedback  and at times overly sympathize with me  if i try to speak confidently about my negative interactions with my narcissist dad  shell criticize me for  seeing the worst in people   My dad punishes me for grey rocking him by blaming me for  not caring  or treating me as if Im somehow abusing him  thus  he assigns me pointless chores to soothe his ego  acts passive aggressive  belligerent  and offended if I dont discuss my hobbies with him  seeing how he always uses them either to brag to his toxic family  or to mock me or  praise  me if theyre hobbies he likes make him  look  good  He likes to pretend hes a fucking drill sergeant  except he was in the military for a couple of years and everything he does is to bolster his own ego  tear down our social boundaries and makes us feel inadequate and insecure in front of toxic people or simply mean and difficult people rather to make us  tougher  and more  disciplined   seeing how my dad is triggered by me and my sister not giving af about his toxic behaviour and what he thinks    The worst part is  I have no clue if my malignant narcisist dads gaslighting and abuse is somehow  right   I cant even tell the difference between toxic gaslighting bullying or genuine attempts at friendly joking  teasing  banter  or constructive criticism  At my high school and university  i remember always feeling triggered and insecure of what teachers  professors  and teaching assistants thought about and currently think of me  as some of them did things that always felt the same as how my dad wouldve treated me and other people  For example  I would always get triggered by their  jokes   about how students were somehow  spoiled  or believed that  teachers professors teaching assistants  were  out to get them   I would also get offended if people with authority would make sarcastic and or condescending remarks  or make comments that I would feel that were emotionally manipulative  e g  once i could not tell if my professor was joking or genuinely being mean spirited when he bitterly criticized the class during lecture for supposedly having  messy handwriting   saying  we  professors  have feelings too   some people in the class laughed  but i could not tell if they were doing this because they were nervous  they were scared of being mocked by the professor  they wanted to laugh along the professor  or if they were trying to put down their fellow students   I cant have a normal conversation with my fellow students without feeling nonstop shame and that I need to over apologize  because if i dont apologize then i feel like i sound narcissistic myself when i simply try to speak normally and confidently Sorry if this post doesnt make any sense  anyways thanks for reading this post and hope everyone is taking care and doing well,9623,1673

1577,p7hsdj,0,2,i cant seem to gather up the courage to say anything to my parents without getting ridiculed i    have been living in fear that anytime i feel the need to come clean about something  itll always end with my mom  and my dad if its big enough  shitting on me about how i dont know shit and that im always in the wrong  i dont even remember this happening in my early childhood  but back then i was receiving so much validation from other parents and hearing them say i was the daughter they all wished they had  i felt very good hearing that a lot  and it made me feel superior from the other kids  i guess it could explain why i was bullied by those that i thought were cool  and why i was an asshole to those that actually  did  care about me it wasnt until middle school where id open up about feeling depressed and just not good overall where i kept getting shit like  youre too young to know what depression is like  youre just doing it to get attention  youre perfectly fine  stop lying to your friends about this   that last line was because they would look through my conversations between me and friends and them questioning what i meant by that was when i had to open up about it  i thought they were supposed to care  but it kept going and it never really changed since then  i was also forced to come out as queer in middle school as well for the same reason  they always felt the need to look through my shit  i had a secret phone to avoid them from tracking what i do on my main phone too but i got caught with it  its safe to assume they also did not take my queerness all too well  they even publicly shamed me for it  in the beginning of the year ive had to come to terms with me possibly having ADHD  and it all made sense with how ive been doing academically both in college and everything else before it  ive been doing extremely shitty in college  my GPA is not high enough for me to register for the fall semester and ive been kicked out until spring  i want to tell them i think i have ADHD and i need to seek a diagnosis to make sure  but im worried itll trace back to me not knowing shit and that im only making excuses for doing so bad in my classes  i went from being an honor roll GT student  to a student that cant even hold at least a  for very long  its not that im stupid  i know im not  its just me being forgetful a lot of the time  as well as spacing out during lectures and being unable to take notes without being distracted  if i write my notes out then ill either doodle on my paper or be too focused on getting everything down to even pay attention to anything else  if i type my notes out ill also be too focused on making sure my notes are perfect  or play games instead  and if i just sit there and listen  ill forget all about it without anything to look back on  pretty sure i can send in a repeal to explain what happened  but i would need proof of being tested for ADHD which i dont have  and if i still try and it doesnt work out then im gonna have to come clean about not being able to take classes  again    its scary with them  i wish they were more understanding and see that im not a lazy pile of shit im almost positive i can afford a diagnosis  its just the lack of support from my family as well as the lack of independence from my part  i dont even have a job because i have to stay behind and take care of my brother when he comes home and clean the house before he does  and if i do work it has to be under my parents terms  i dont know how to drive either since no one has the time or energy to teach me after working all day  i cant do shit for myself and its frustrating  i do plan on moving out soon and stick with some friends so i can be able to build up my independence slowly but surely,3807,747

1581,p7hhqh,0,6,Should I call CPS on my Nmom  This is gonna be long  So I’ve never shared my story here before but I feel this is detrimental  My mom is not only a narc but also a raging drug addict  My entire life I’ve endured physical beatings  verbal abuse  being surrounded by drugs  watching strange men come in and out of her life  frequently spending nights alone in random trap houses etc  Fortunately I escaped as soon as i turned   Mom pretends to be confused by my abrupt leave and continues to harass me occasionally either by text  from a fake number  or runs to the rest of the family to tarnish my name  Because of this I receive frequent phone calls from my grandparents and other members of the family calling me disrespectful and demanding that I forgive my mom  And yes  they know everything because i’ve called them in panic multiple times before trying to expose my mom in hopes of them doing something  And their response was “it doesn’t matter ” Instead  they enable her behavior and send her funds even when they know exactly what it’s for  So now all  their numbers are blocked  But the remaining problem is that my younger sibling    is still under her care but ILLEGALLY as she does not have custody  CPS was called on her before  by her school and they took my sister away and my grandparents illegally sent her back to live under those same circumstances   i resent them a lot for this as they are very wealthy and even took me in as a child for a couple years but would not do the same for her because “they don’t like teenagers”  If you couldn’t already tell I come from a Narcissistic family with a cult like mentality  Anyway  I’m afraid forthe safety and future of my sister and am contemplating calling CPS to explain my mother and the severe neglect my sister is still facing  Unfortunately she’s being manipulated and love bombed by our mother and so she already thinks I’m the bad guy  I know she isn’t my responsibility but I can’t help but feel the need to get her out of there  Im fairly young so I’m not sure if i’d be able to support her take her in but it might be the only way  Everyone in the family refuses to step up and I can’t sit by and watch it  So i’m very conflicted  Also just found out that my mother tried to commit tax fraud under my name to get back at me for ignoring her   I’m so fed up  What should I do,2355,443

1583,p7hd8z,0,2,Just came to the realization of being raised by narcs  but can’t tell if it’s one parent or both Long post incoming  I’ve been trying to learn more about narc parents after coming to the realization that I grew up as a scapegoat  but Im having trouble now identifying which parent is the narc enabler or are they just both narcs  My brain feels like it’s just getting pulled in all kinds of different directions right now trying to figure things out so I can start learning how to go about healing…Dad always says “oh well I guess everything is all my fault then ” whenever I mention anything regarding the way I was raised had an obvious impact on who I am now and the things I have to deal with  almost zero self esteem  always blaming myself for small mistakes  poor ability identifying complex emotions  He would always require me to look at him when he was speaking or it was automatically disrespectful   to the point where one time when I was on the computer talking to him with my back to him he stomped over to me and grabbed my shirt with his fist cocked back like he was going to punch me He will constantly talk about how he couldn’t spend more than an hour with my brother and I by himself because “any longer than that and I would go crazy” We have recently moved and all of a sudden my mom in constantly asking how I’m doing  how much they miss us being around  saying “we don’t hear from you after the move so we have a very parental habit of thinking the worst…”My mom texted me the other day after talking with our son and said “Hey kids   thanks for calling   great to see your faces  When we were talking with  son    we asked if “ your dad was home” we were not checking up on you just talking    son  said “ oh yeah   he’s home but we aren’t getting along   he hates me” We could not be more sure that this isn’t true  but thot we should pass on what he said…love you guys ” which just screams of a zero empathy thing to say as a parent who raised kids of her own…If anyone can help give any thoughts or insight I would really appreciate the help  It’s been a long life and I just want to figure out how to get better,2154,412

1588,p7gwrs,0,3,Isolated and triggered by those with loving parents Feeling very isolated from people my age who have supportive parents  During the pandemic I watched a lot of people in their ’s  I’m    move back home with their parents  I live alone and have been on my own since I was    I had no option of moving back home  I live out of state to be far away from my family  My parents were both physically abusive and emotionally abusive  My narcissistic mom and I used to talk more up until the pandemic when my resentment for her spiraled out of control  When we would talk before  it was only via text and the conversations were meaningless most of the time  Like she didn’t have a genuine interest in my life  it felt forced and never deep  I’ve recently gone no contact for both of them  And I feel completely alone in the world  Recently had a minor car accident and I had no one to turn to for support  I wish I had parents I could call  I have a loving boyfriend now   months    but I subconsciously push him away out of here of getting too close and getting hurt  He has a close relationship with his mom and she is very supportive and loving  Sometimes it bothers me  I feel lots of envy and I can see in our personalities how our relationship with our parents has shaped us in such different ways  While he’s very compassionate and patient  he simply can’t understand my trust issues  anger  depression  loneliness  How could he  When we visit his moms house there are so many photos of him and his sister all over  So many happy memories in those photos  It makes me feel like shit honestly  My mom would never  In fact  there was an incident once where my little sister found childhood pics of us in the trash  It was when her and my mom were moving to a new apartment and my mom claimed the reason was that she scanned all the pics and therefor didn’t need the physical copies  I visited the new apartment before the pandemic and there were no photos of me or my siblings  No big deal but it does trigger me to see all the love he has  I’m affected by this every day  I’m constantly replaying memories of my parents physically beating me while verbally abusing me  My lip is permanently uneven because of how hard my dad hit me on my mouth one day  You can’t notice it that much but I can  and it haunts me  When I was  they sent me away to another country to live with my dad’s psychotic sister  This was because I was depressed and was cutting myself and running away from home due to the physical abuse  After they sent me away I stayed in that country for  years until I was   I’m  now and don’t live in the same state as them and never see them  Last time I saw my dad was  years ago and he hit me  I saw my mom last year and she made no effort to have any type of meaningful conversation  I feel completely alone  I have no guidance or role models   never have  Feels like I raised myself  People praise me on how strong and independent I am but I don’t want to have to be independent at all times  I’ve been in therapy for almost a year and it’s helping just a little but it’s not enough  What else can I do    I’m considering going to a crisis center for resources  I wish I had friends who have similar situations so that we could be each others support  but honestly they all mostly have great relationships with their parents  My depression about this is affecting my life to the point where I am missing work and experiencing ptsd  Any advice is appreciated,3489,667
1589,p7gtzm,0,3,My new therapist made me realize that I do have physical trauma and I dont know how to feel Growing up I never considered myself physically abused and almost never thought to mention it to anybody I was seeing but yesterday I had an initial session with my new therapist and she went through the different traumas to see what I had experienced and when she brought up physical trauma I answered  kinda  and when she asked me to explain I did  When I was younger my nmother would slap me or hit me with objects every once in a while for small things but never on a continuous basis so I didnt consider it physical abuse but my therapist explained that hitting of any kind was abuse and that my obvious visceral reaction  I had started crying  showed that it did affect me  Its now a day after and I still dont know how to feel  I never felt growing up that I was being physically abused and never considered it as something I needed to deal with in therapy but my therapist seems right in that I wouldnt react the way I did unless it really affected me  I dont know how to feel moving forward anymore,1106,209
1590,p7gtft,0,5,Older brother reestablished contact with Ndad for money  Im hurt and furious and dont know what else to say to him  One one hand  we are grown adults  Its his choice  But one reason I went NC was because narcs dont get better if theyre enabled by their old family system  I want my dad to go to therapy  Even though I KNOW he probably will never admit he needs it  my brother reestablishing contact will make Ndad think that all of us will come back to him  It makes me feel totally hopeless Ndad is a master at ingratiating himself to people  My brother has had money troubles  new house  newly divorced  lately  and Im pretty sure hes allowing himself contact with my dad because hes offering money  Hes allowing himself to be bought and has no problem with that  its come up before when my dad started leaving me checks after fights  which I rejected  Brother said he wouldve cashed them   That  in turn  is making Ndad feel like this is a normal and acceptable behavior Im worried and hurt about my brother  If I tell my other siblings  theyre likely to cut him out  Brother has already been on the outs with my other siblings  but recently things have been better with him  However  he has displayed many narcissistic qualities and withdrew during our family decision making to cut Ndad out  But he has shown resilience and heart when it mattered When I found out  all I could say to my brother was to please respect our boundaries and not talk about us to NDad  which he agreed to  I asked him to tell the other NC family members to not breach their trust  but he ignored me  My gut is telling me to quietly withdraw from my brother  which I dont want to do because our family has already been fractured enough  Its the easy option  Were all adults with kids and are busy  Should I bother confronting him or just wait it out,1853,334

1592,p7g7vr,0,4,Trapped in possible Toxic Household  am I  F  the one who is in the wrong  How do I navigate this situation  Tldr  There is a lack of communication in my home but whenever I bring up how I feel or ask for some respect  Im always met with things such as  I need therapy   Sister and Mother show signs of being unable to take responsibility for their actions while I have to  let go  of things and  try my best   I feel unsatisfied and unhappy at home  Everything feels stagnant First off  thank you for taking the time to read my post  Im going to try and make this as unbiased as possible for everyone involved I  F  have grown up in an abusive and toxic family  My dad    abused my mother    throughout the years and our household was divided  I grew up with two elder sisters and one elder brother  I was bullied by my brother and grew up with a number of mental issues  to say the least  The bullying stopped in high school but there were still a lot of arguments until my mother kicked my father out once we went to university It is safe to say  Mother endured a lot for the sake of allowing us to grow up with a Father until we were at the age we could handle a separation  Time fast forward  and things have settled a lot in our house  No arguments etc We have all started our own healing journeys  apart from my brother and one sister I think   Sister       well call her S  reads a lot of books as for my Mother who reads a lot of self improvement and spirituality books  This is for the same as me I recently started taking my healing journey seriously and began shadow work that explored my past trauma  I began to realize a lot of ways I lacked boundaries and I also explored a lot of ways this led to me being mistreated growing up e g bullying  attracting those who disregarded my  non existant  boundaries But I always felt resistance around returning home from university  I feel as if I was scapegoated in my family  I told my mother this I dont think she considered my perspective too much  Even reading a lot  I realized I was still being disrespected by my elders in the house An example of this is one time I asked my S and S to clean the bathroom  They ignored me over text at first but when I chased them up S went into a speech about how I did not need to be a hero all the time and if I left it then it would be done   except I had left it for a week and a half and it wasnt being done  I felt like shit and I told Mother but I believe she only told me to ignore her Id like to say S  who I live with mainly  works a lot  She puts in a lot of hours and I can appreciate she feels exhausted a lot  I  myself  do not work  but I try to ensure I put in a lot of housework as possible Fast forward to March when I returned home from university  One sign of trouble came from when I tried making jokes with Mother  She would often give me a dead  straight face and I eventually gave up trying to make jokes with her  however  she would come to me later and say she thinks I lost my sense of humour  I believe this came from her trying to make jokes with me but I would not be receptive due to our earlier instances In the meantime  S has her things in my room in a wardrobe she paid for  It is a better wardrobe than what I had for before and I am truly grateful for it but I do not have enough space for my things  The first time I asked S to move out she tried to joke it was her wardrobe but I did not laugh as I was serious  I told her I felt disrespected but she told me to be positive which I told her was toxic  She then went on a long speech telling me to basically accept her being in my room and I had nothing to say So I continued my shadow work and due to a lot of trauma coming to the surface  I began feeling down which was noticeable  Mother would ask me what was wrong but I would brush her off until one day I came to her and told her how I felt about growing up in the house  She told me to let it go and that growing up wasnt that bad  I personally feel like she dismissed my feelings I also told her about times I felt disrespected and gave her examples    For instance  at times she was sarcastic to me for no reason and she told me I need to accept the way people are  I told her about Ss things in my room and she told me S came to her  I asked her what she cried about and Mother said some people have a lot going on  I told Mother this was emotional manipulation and Mother made everything about me Despite being unhappy in the house  I was told I should consider therapy and that I should try and do better  Mother also told me about her she had to endure a lot of abuse in those past years and went on a long speech about Lord knows what Fast forward to today  I have been unhappy for a  hours  staying in my room and just being by myself because nothing I bring up gets resolved  Mother came to my room and said  cant you wash up when were not here   BARING IN MIND  I always wash up when I see dishes in the sink  Last year  it was me that was washing up most days  S sits at a table and does work  I always feel like the dishes get left to me to do Ive been doing so for the past months  I have been feeling depressed and unhappy but I feel like Mother came to me  judging me for not washing up  I told her I was busy so I could not talk in that moment but she left on a final note of judging me I exploded  I went downstairs and ranted about how I feel like I am not considered  I called out their hypocrisy and told S and Mother everything is about my issues and how I need therapy and how they can not take responsibility for their actions  I also told MOther she had a victmin mentality and mocked her for her abuse  bad I know and I am not proud of it S told my mother I called her mentally abusive when I asked her to move out of my room  I told her Mother told me how she cried to her and they both denied it  S accused me of being aggressive the first time I asked her to move out of my room  the second  Mother was present  I snapped at them and said I would happily move out and not speak to them  Honestly  if I was able to leave  I would happily do so  I told them both they had victim mentalities and they told me they are worried about my mental health and denied everything I brought up What do you guys think about this situation  I will clarify further if needs be  What do I do  Communication is lacking in my house but I feel like what I bring up will always be my fault Thank you for reading  I am sorry for the length of my post,6576,1299

1598,p7fj5q,0,9,Does any of you fantasize about using violence against you abusers  Disclaimer  Im in constant contact with my therapist  i just ask because these kind of thoughts have been a bit numerous recently since my home abusers have tightened the attacks Some of my fantasies can be kinds fucked up but Im fighting the intrusive thoughts,333,55
1599,p7f66o,0,32,its so hard growing up when your parents are not grown ups  my dad acts like a  year old and my mom acts like shes   everyone has always been like  you are so grown up and mature for your age   well  its because these two act like children with all their stupid drama and attention seeking  I am not seen as someone of myself or as myself  Any time my mom gets me something  its just something she wanted for herself and uses me as the excuse to be selfless  All i asked for was a slice of dang chocolate cake for my birthday  thats all i wanted  And she gets all these clothes and shoes  and when i say I DIDNT WANT THIS  I DIDNT WANT THIS  I AM MOVING TO A WHOLE NEW PLACE ACROSS THE PACIFIC  she just could not understand  I told her i just got rid of a bunch of shit to move and she could just not understand  I am became the ungratful bitch because i didnt want the clothes i told her not to buy cause i am moving  man  so much for a supportive family  gosh  this whole family is just a chaos of energy and it just makes me not want to be with anyone but myself  because i know myself and understand what i like and dont like  heck it makes me not want to be with or around people ever again  i am better alone  then they try to infantilize you to make them FEEL like their good parents  but sometimes i think thats just all that they know  they dont know how to really be supportive or to aplogize when they do something wrong  cause they see nothing they do as wrong   they dont know how to take the fact that you have a different opinion from them into consideration  its just like you are this extention of themselves even when you dont want to be  you want to be yourself  you want to be F R E E  you want to be understood instead of trying to always understand them  i think its just better to maybe love these people at a distance  they dont notice the difference weather you are close or far away cause in the end they dont see you  you just become a reflection of themselves   amp  xB gosh  all of it just makes me feel so broken at times  like completely incomplete  they will never see what they do as wrong or you as an individual   but how do you fix it  and maybe its ok to be broken  you know  people tell me the world is not broken  but when you feel broken and you dont understand it how do you see it as anything else  how do you wade through it  how do you find the right way to deal with it,2431,483
1600,p7f4y0,0,4,My   Parents think theyve done nothing wrong and everything is my fault Since I was a kid Ive never felt any sense of identity  Even now Im barely sure who I am  Im not very smart so my parents would always get mad at me for bad grades even though I tried my best in school  It made me think I might have adhd  although it may just be brain fog  but I cant talk to anyone I bhbecause they shut it down immediately  My mom was bad at school too and her Dad would be angry but her Mom supported her nonetheless  You’d think she would be understanding pf what I had to deal with at school and even college now but no  I get no support at all  just physical abuse and verbal abuse Im  now  I cant talk to anyone in my family becuase they have toxic tendencies  I avoid talking or being in the same proximity as my parents or siblings because they will give me bad looks or say negative things about me  get angry and start acting annoyed  I dont have a job and as much as I want to get one  Ive been way too stressed out lately with relationships  my physical and mental health and other things  I pretty much shut myself off from everyone because I felt I had to in order to take steps forward The are constantly  comparing me to my brother who had “a lot” more freedom and knowlegde about the world than I did even at my age now  He wasnt even  yet he was allowed across the country no problem  He would leave for months and be back like no one cared  Me    I need  Permission to walk the shop  meters away  Basically I feel like Ive never really experienced anything in life and im trying to do too much at once because its what my parents want me to do while also trying to balance fixing my mental health  my possible eating disorder  and exercising  college as well as other things they have stopped me from doing  I feel held back mentally by what they will think and say If I do a certain thing  My parents have me fucked up and are expecting things from me when Im doing my best simply trying to recover  Like just an hour ago they were screaming at me for being underweight saying im gonna die and some other crap I cant remember then start asking me why I dont have a drivers license or fiance and what not  If you need to know  they arent a necessity when Im doing the most just trying to stay aliveIm stressed out  I only wanna get better and THEN get a job  I have a lot to say but my phone is too slow to type for some strange reason  Am I the one at fault here  Am I just blaming others,2522,495

1603,p7epbd,0,113,What goes through narcissistic parents minds before they die  Last night  I found out from a sibling that my nmom is scared of dying and is having counselling for that  To start I was weirded out that a narcissist in their eighties nineties hasn’t reconciled to death already  But today I am thinking that for a narcissist whats truly terrible about dying is the realisation that they won’t be able to aggressively control people anymore  Am interested in other peoples’ thoughts on this,488,82

1605,p7eh61,0,4,I dont know how to help my sister and my mother I have a  years old sister who goes through her character development phase  My mom is quite conservative and she does not agree with lgbt  all black clothes and all those things  Thing is  she has a huge ego  doesnt take any advice and keeps yelling at my sister things like  DO YOU HATE ME   WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM MY LIFE  YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED   I tried talking to her for so long telling her yelling is not the best solution and she should try other methods  I told her she should not take her anger out on my sister  that my sister doesnt need to hear such things from her  But she never listens and takes it all personally saying that we keep criticising her  we accuse her  shes only good at making food for us  victim mentality  My sister  of course  is very deeply impacted by this  she cries and comes to me and tells me that she just wants a mother who hears her feelings  My mom continuously yells at her and was like that to me as well  i have a deep self hatred and low self esteem now in my s  Im very shy and can barely talk to people  I dont want my sisters self esteem to be impacted like that but apparently it is  she doesnt like anything about herself as well and even though I keep telling her shes beautiful  she doesnt seem to believe it  Mind you that my sister is also difficult  she has a strong violent character  anger bursts  but I believe this is all because she feels misunderstood  Im thinking of gathering both her and my sister and let them have a talk  while I interfere too  asking them what are the things that bother each other and try to find solutions  But I dont know if its the best idea  I told my mom to read some books on parenting or go to a therapist but she was deeply offended  Any advice,1804,348
1606,p7e96o,0,2,Just remembered something  My parents both used to play World of Warcraft before i did   Dont question it  its weird  When they divorced  especially my mom kept playing extreme amounts  but that stopped when she met her new boyfriend  now my stepfather   When she stopped  she gave her account to me  but at the same time always kept asking if her old characters still existed and how i ruined them  even tho i didnt even touch them  But she kept being adamant about this  This may seem small  but it has lead to me discovering that she did use this sort of behaviour all the time against me  even in much more extreme circumstances  I now suffer from avoidant personality disorder and depression,702,123
1607,p7e4g5,0,2,Looking for Insight I am new to this sub so sorry in advance if my story isnt formatted well or whatever  My  M  parents and I had a difficult relationship growing up  but things were going pretty well with them up until last June when my Dad passed away suddenly  I had mixed feelings about his death as  while I loved him  he was an alcoholic and that affected his ability to be a good parent  My mom is an emotionally abusive narcissist who knows how to push everyones buttons in order to get what she wants out of people  When my Dad died  he left my NMom behind and she went into a tailspin  The past year has been full of guilt trips  manipulation  and emotional abuse  I will only share one example in order to keep this short    after I had moved in with her for approx   months following my Dads death  I was preparing to leave for a series of road trips in September  at the end of which I was going to propose to my now fiancee  I was going to be gone for like  weeks and was very visibly excited about the upcoming engagement  On my way out the door my Mom sat me down out of the blue and gave me on of the worst guilt trips of my life  including insinuating that I cant leave for my trip and do my proposal because  I need you to be here with me as my companion   It really messed with me and put a damper on the whole thing  I eventually reconnected with my therapist in order to start working on anger issues  We determined that my anger issues stem from a childhood of abuse  as anger is a defense mechanism to help prevent abuse  My therapist has been helping me understand why healthy boundaries are necessary  Setting boundaries has been complicated as my mom still needs to sell her house and we  my twin sister and I  have been doing a LOT of work on it  for example  we did    in drywall repairs after it was discovered that one of the piles of hoarded shit in the basement had covered the walls in black mold   My sister and I both just want to get this house sold so we can move on with our lives but my mom kept adding more and more stuff to the  list  while delaying listing it on the market  My sister  our fiancees  and I got together recently and decided enough is enough  that we would insist that she either put the house on the market or pay for someone else to continue to improve the house  Essenrially  enough with the free work  we have our own lives  On the  year anniversary of my Dads death  my fiancee and I went over to her house for dinner  It was the typical stuff  she wasnt going to eat because she is too sad  etc    The conversation turned to the house and I asserted that she should sell it ASAP  She countered with  there is so much that still needs to be done   I said  you need to pay someone to do that stuff  because I cant do all of it   Her response was  why would I do that when I have children who are supposed to help me   She then laid into me with a shocking and nasty amount of emotional abuse  like  you are a bad son    I am disappointed in you   and  I thought you were here to support me but I guess youre just here to abandon me in my time of need   I stuck to my guns and didnt lose my temper    just stayed stoic and assertive about the whole thing  thanks therapy   until she kicked us out of the house  Since then Ive decided to go Low Contact  It was very revealing to hear the abuse coming out of her that heavily    its almost like that abusive intent has been the whole time but shes been more tactful about it in the past  Ive talked to her just a few times  She sent a text saying she doesnt know why our relationship is strained  I explicitly told her that I am setting boundaries as a part of my trauma work in therapy due to the abuse I suffered as a child at home  school  and church  she is heavily religious and is a director of religious education for the Catholic Church   She said she would do  whatever it takes  to repair our relationship  We had my sisters wedding last month and my fiancee suggested that I ask her to dance for a slow song  During our dance she started saying things like  Im sorry for whatever I did  and  Can we please just go to the pool together    This rubbed me the wrong way because its not a matter of  whatever you did   You told me I was a bad son like a month ago after I fixed your house up for a year  Im seriously not mad about it  but like  do you not understand why that was a problem  Do I want this person to continue to be a presence in my life  Also  is she still just trying to get something out of me  Yesterday  I called my sister with some exciting news about grad school and at the end of the conversation she said  you should call mom and tell her  she has been asking about you and wondering how you are   I was going to call my mom    until I thought  why   I dont want to open myself up to her misery and emotional abuse today  Later on  I got a text from my mom saying that she misses me  Can anyone else share some insight on if when they felt comfortable lessening their Low Contact policy with with Nparent  and why  I have been enjoying my  freedom  from the abuse recently and am in no rush    however I DO want to attempt to improve our relationship at some point,5255,1012
1608,p7dy58,0,31,I actually hate my Nmum  She lied to me and then embarrassed me at the dentist I go to  And I also think she may be a Karen idk  Basically last week she spoke to the dentist and all week she had me believe that I was finally getting braces put in today even thoe deep down I knew I wasnt actually getting braces today at all because I think I had a gut Instinct When we arrived at the dentist since its covid we werent allowed to go in and had to speak to the receptionist from the front window to confirm our booking and then they told my Nmum that I was only allowed in and that she had to wait outside until I finished my appointment due to covid restrictions and such and its not like the staff meant any hatred or Ill will for my Nmum they were litterly just following the law And then this was when all hell broke loose and my mum started litterly arguing with the reception staff to let her in so she could be with me just incase I cried once I got my braces on and they told her she was not allowed in and even if she was she is not allowed to go into the operation room with me she due to covid so she would have to wait in the reception In the end they finally told her she could come in after her arguing with the staff for a while and they told her she had to wear a mask before she was allowed in thoe and since my non vaccinated  and non mask wearin Nmum didnt have one on they tried to give her one to wear and my Nmum had the audacity to litterly refuse to wear the mask and be like  its ok I will just put up my shirt and use that as a mask   said in a Karen tone  and then the receptionist again said politely   plz put on the mask otherwise your not allowed to come in  and after much argument and rebuttal from my Nmums and she finally agreed to wear the mask and came inside and sat down on a chair  meters away from me and she was still kinda complaining but in our language this time instead of English And then the receptionist informed my mum that she wasnt allowed to come into the actual operation dentist room with me and that she would have to wait in the reception waiting area and my mum argued back again like this was getting to my nerves at this point and I litterly wanted to shout and tell my mum to shut the hell up but sadly I missed that opportunity And then the orthodontist came and called me to my appointment operation room and then as I was getting up to leave I told my Nmum in my language to just sit there and not say anything and she said ok And then in the room the orthodontist bascially told me what I had already thought and said this was my first appointment to towards getting my braces and that I wasnt actually gonna get braces today And they told me to go to the reception and book a checkup appointment to get my teeth checked and then when I went there as I went up the receptionist my mum got up and was asking me questions about what they said and stuff like that and I didnt want to deal with her so I didnt answer back and then whilst I was booking my appointment for my checkup the receptionist said since I was already there they had a free orthodontist doctor available and said I would have to wait upstairs for  minutes and at this point they told my mum she would have to wait outside agian and again the child like tantrum on why she cant wait outside  started and I was just over my Nmumd attitude so I just went upstairs completely ignoring her whole she argued with the receptionist on why she should be allowed to sit with me and then finally I heard her say  im going  I am going  very loudly from upstairs and I just felt hella embarrassed about the whole situation Anyway I had my checkup and when I was heading downstairs to leave I wanted to apologise to the reception staff for my Nmums behaviour but I was too embarrassed Anway I went outside and as too nobodys surprise my mum was still mad about the whole situation and she basically decided she wanted to let the whole world know how mad she was as she continued to complain in our language very loudly on our way to the bus stop saying things like this is why I hate  Christians or non muslims  because my mother is a muslim and hates anyone from any religion other than her own and I told her to quite down but she wouldnt listen And then when we went onto the bus my Nmum who I was clearly mad at couldnt tell I was mad at her so she reportedly asked me the same question of  what did the orthodontist say about your braces and teeth  and I kept replying by saying  pls stop talking  which sounds way better and nicer than it does in English and plus there were people on the bus and my Nmum had no respect for them and was like  are we not allowed to talk  I mean we could but Im mad at you and your talking very loudly and thats fucking rude to the other passengers  And after a while of me responding with the same line she got the memo and said  fine I will stop talking  And then when we got of the bus and was walking home she kept saying how she would write a formal complaint about the reception staff and how she would get them all fired  And I was fast walking and after a while o stopped to get the house keys from her and continued to fast walk home and she said  why are you walking so fast   why are you mad at me I did nothing wrong  I didnt respond quickly entered the house took my shoes off and went to my room not before telling my two siblings what our mum did and both of them agreed that  that was embarrassing And then my sister went downstairs and my mum told her a complete different and false story than the real one that happened and my Nmum had the audacity to tell me not speak to her and act like victim when she was the embarrassing one,5751,1121

1610,p7da4y,0,2,A bit of a positive Update of my current situation  So I had deleted my last post which I had posted here due to some reasons but still I would like to share this  So my nmom has started behaving a bit aggressive and like a bitch as I am making some progress in my YT career of making videos  Even if my dad is a edad he is supporting my work by sneaking me out and saving me from my mom  Since somedays me and my dad have been doing some joint operations of grey rocking her but today the bloody iphone just didnt indicate that the call with my nmom was not over and we were planning the next sneak out for me and she heard me  amp  my dads entire conversation and as we came home she started talking like a bitch to me and my dad   Me being me I started to make fun of her but she reacted by scratching me in my hands and giving me some slaps on my head but still I continued to make fun of her as usual😂  The reason why my dad is supporting me is I am truthful to him and he can see my work and he appreciates it but my nmom is turning into a complete bitch  p s  this is our second fight like this  She just blames my dad for everything,1142,237
1611,p7d91t,0,14,After reflecting on my abusive upbringing  I think that I was very close to being a conspiracy theorist or a terrorist or a narcissist who hates the world and I think that this is why I do not like to label conspiracy theories or similar groups as  idiotic  and can empathise more  I hope that I am not being too far fetched here or posting something that is not appropriate I have been doing a lot of self reflection  which is something that I do often especially with the help of my therapist and the mindfulness that I do   I have been reflecting on my past self and I realised that over the years  I have been doing with large amounts of anger and fury  sometimes in explosive ways and especially towards anything and anyone  including me   I still struggle with anger but I noticed that I sometimes manage to suppress it or process it but knowing that I still struggle with this type of anger that is often directed with the attitude of unfairness or cynicism or victimisation  that really caught my attention I must admit   as much as I really hate it and it annoys me  victimisation feels addicting and it is almost empowering for the most pity and sympathy you will get  There are moments I want to victimise myself without realising it and  find an excuse  for this victimization by saying that I was treated unfairly  I do understand that many people are oppressed and will end up feeling angry for such injustices but over time  I later learned that I have to be responsible for my own actions and process these thoughts accordingly And I noticed that while I still struggle with some form of anger or I have this occasional dose of paranoia and cynicism that makes me think that I am about to become a conspiracy theorist  I realise that before  I used to actually think like this at a much greater level And to some extent  I do believe that those who actively behave in ways are akin to conspiracy theorists  or terrorists or just being plain arrogant  I think I can understand where this stems from   a lot of unprocessed emotions and insecurities that are projected to someone else  possibly as a side effect of some troubled upbringing or trauma  amp  xB A part of me says that this cynicism is sound  If my life mostly involved being warped and twisted in ways that make me so hateful and angry towards the world and think that it is about to get me  it is no wonder I have this survival instinct to think of the worst and think of anything that can happen even if it may not be real because the mind is a very cunning thing if you are not careful Truth to be told  there is some logic to this as well because if you dig deeper into this  you will realise that injustices did and still exist in some shape or form  There are ones that are even on a governmental level or a nation wide level and ones that were either done in secret or ones that people know to exist but some people got away with it for whatever reason   whether it was power  money  influence and so on So obviously  when combined with this warped idea that the world is a cold and cruel place  especially knowing that I was raised in that type of environment that eventually shaped this kind of reality in me  this eventually leads to some very unhealthy thinking and ones that will be very difficult to tackle because they go keep into your core and affect your primal instincts and how you feel about yourself and the universe  amp  xB I am not saying that people who are terrorists or conspiracy theorists or whatever are excused  If people break the law or harm others or try to spread information that is not real or twisted or want to manipulate or influence people to push a certain agenda that is based on a very passionate and possibly immoral attitude  then of course  this will lead to its own consequences We have many arguments in philosophy  psychology  political theory and even history that delve into this and they tell us how this type of thinking will have its own repercussions But I will not lie     whenever I see these people or hear their claims  I am more inclined to ask why they think like this or understand where these ideas are stemming from instead of neglecting them entirely and calling them  fools,4252,757
1612,p7d3jx,0,10,How to stop my mom commenting on my food  I had lunch with my parents  in my opinion it was a small meal  small portion of pasta with tomatoes and salad  and I was still hungry so I made myself an egg  My mom who is ALWAYS commenting on what I eat  and is probably the reason why I dont have the healthiest relationship with food   although they dont know  said that  pasta and eggs shouldnt be eaten together  I think I strained my eye muscles from rolling my eyes too much  Im  and Im healthy  honestly who cares if I have one egg after eating pasta  I looked for support from my dad saying  ugh is it that important if I eat one egg after pasta      but he  as always  didnt say anything and left the room  Proteins and carbs together will make you sick   she says   Uhhh I dont think just that will make me sick  and even if it happens  Ill remember it for next time and avoid that food combination  I said  I dont care about what your beliefs around food are  so stop commenting  Her   Theyre not beliefs  its what it is   Eggs and pasta dont go together  you cant eat them in the same meal    Me   I dont care  so stop commenting  Her   Its not about what you care  proteins and carbs dont go together   Me   And I dont care about your comments  Do I talk about finance to you    Her   Its normal comments  just like talking about the weather    Me   I dont care  stop commenting  This time she stopped but only because she was going to rest in the afternoon  Usually she goes on and on forever and I have to go to my bedroom to get some peace But how do I make her stop entirely  Its ALWAYS like this  almost at every meal and at everything I do in general  Moving out is not an option  I have  years of university ahead of me and even with a part time job Im stuck here,1821,333
1613,p7co3b,0,6,Realized my twin was my narcissist not my neglectful mom Sure my mom is a narcissist  just not to me  Im  now and it really hurts that the deep connection Ive always dreamed having with her was all a lie   I found out a couple weeks ago shes been cheating on her husband   they met  years ago in high school  the entire time with at least  different men  She decided to leave him  because he doesnt impress her work friends     And get a divorce because hes boring and doesnt help around the house  which were lies   Not two days after she coerced him into getting a vasectomy so she would have sex with him again  because she already ruined her body popping out  kids  she hooked up with some guy on a work trip  Shes never been truthful with me  all the lies started becoming apparent because if this  but I suspected she was cheating so I just happened to ask after she decided to move out  She was bragging about this guy and claiming shes so excited for me to meet him  Ive had a pretty deep platonic connection with her husband since they met  but she was feeding both of us lies about how shitty the other was which kept us from pursuing our friendship all these years  she though I was a slut and would fuck him      We recently reconnected as hes been pursuing his spirituality manhood through yoga and meditation  I encouraged him and even read a few books to discuss with him  This infuriated her  She would be cold when I came over and even bitched at us for talking during a shitty kids TV show we had put on for our kids   husband later explained  she likes to check out mentally at night and we disturbed that   like wtf    The real kicker for me is when I told her about a house my husband and I just bought in January that wasnt going to be ready until end of this month   yay just  more weeks   She literally had no reaction  Totally flat and avoidant  I learned later that she blew up on her ex demanding they renovate their house   a s model in the best neighborhood in our city  saying they never gave anything nice and shes sick of living in this shitty house  The icing on the cake is that I realize she had wanted to leave him the last few years but now she kicked it into high gear trying to find a man to monkey branch to  After announcing she was divorcing a few weeks ago she couldnt kick her husband out so she immediately got a new luxury br  apartment and moved out   conveniently before my house was ready      She rented a truck and completely trashed the house   taking all her shit  shed basically hoarded a hobby lobby at this point shutting the family out  without any regard to what her kids thought was theirs   She plans on having half custody of her  kids   girls  boy age    in that  extra bedroom   Relax  Im happy now so theyll be fine    Her psychopathy baffles me  It broke my heart hearing my nieces say  mommy took all my makeup and paints    I started hearing about the abusive episodes right before they split up  she proudly admitted them herself   I locked my daughter in a dog cage I the basement for two hours because she kept waking me up at night saying shes scared  Thank God she doesnt complain anymore   She spent her sons kid birthday party getting smashed and complaining how dense husband was  She didnt even acknowledge him and even dumped her kids off on me and disappeared  When her son and husband wanted to stay longer she went home and locked the bedroom door forcing husband to sleep in the basement  Even though she portrays herself as an awesome laid back mom  they raise themselves right     Shes literally never had the kids by herself for more than a day and husband actually did a majority of the childcare behind closed doors    he never helps around the house all he does is play with kids    He wanted her to do one week by herself before she took custody and she flat out refused  Even though she has supposed half custody the kids basically have just done weekends with her  Im disgusted and shocked by all this as she brushes it off as being the best time in her life  shes finally free     I also realized shes been trying to convince me my husbands a lazy controlling worthless piece of shit  which hes not  for the whole  years of our relationship  I almost did leave  but thank God u have enough humility to apologize for my shitty behavior  Ive always tied my identity with her  cuz you know twins  but Its cathartic to finally be okay with myself and realize Im not a narc just because I come from a family of them  Thanks for listening to my long rant,4593,854

1616,p7cgkn,0,12,Its as if nParents have a select few  parenting values  that never change  never have exceptions  and are life or death  Like my parents flipped when the cabin light gets turned on in the car at night and this is a prime albeit benign example  Im highlighting this topic because I think it has a lot to do with the abusive tendencies they have  as if theyre brains are frozen in a childlike state of obedience TO the rules they learned  and now being in a position of power over a child obviously cant have them doing things they didnt get to do Im sure you can think of examples because what I mean extends beyond the definition of  rules  exactly and I know I went on a tangent a bit but ya what do you think,720,136

1618,p7c46j,0,4,I’m so tired of being poor after escaping N parents… My N parents has always given me money growing up all until the end of college university  They never taught me financial literacy and I had to learn myself from the age of    years ago   and didn’t really go far  I’m the only child so it was a given that all their assets would be passed down to me  and I lived with that safety net for most my life until recently  About a year ago  all their emotional and verbal abuse came to light and I realised that I was abused throughout my childhood growing up  I decided to not kiss their ass anymore and became LC  Subsequently  it is likely that I won’t be receiving the inheritance  and it’s been difficult for me to come to terms with that as I had thought I’d be financially well all my life  That’s not to say that I didn’t work hard  but when N parents used money as a means of control  you end up relying on them  and being more careless about money saving less choosing less money driven careers  If I knew I was gonna be cut off  I would have chosen a more lucrative career and started younger  Now I’m in lockdown and living in a two bedroom house with my partner and in laws  The house is small and moldy and I just feel so sad and poor  And confined in such a small space  All our stuff is in one bedroom and there is hardly any storage  We can’t move due to lockdown and it won’t be classed as an emergency move  Not to mention it’ll cost x more than the amount that we are paying now for board which is   week  The in laws are lovely but we’ve been here for  months still waiting for our new  small  house to be built  It’s been delayed by about  months and likely another   months due to lockdown  Does anyone have any tips on how to cope with these feelings  I wasn’t sure which subreddit to post in…Thanks so much in advance,1866,355
1619,p7bycu,0,31,Is anyone else close with their Nparent and love them  but also they can be so awful and toxic and hurt you so much  Title might be confusing  For context  I don’t know if my mother is a narcissist  but she has so many narcissistic traits  We look exactly alike  our personalities are basically the same and I do love my mum very much  There are times when she is so good to me  can help me in a situation mostly and be kind  But there are other times  throughout my whole life where she is just awful  She’s a recovered alcoholic  and when she was drinking it was much worse  But we argue sometimes and she says the most evil things  even if we make up  we could be having a nice conversation and some narc type thing is slipped in and it makes my heart ache so much  How can she be so loving and nice but also have such shitty opinions and words sometimes I probably haven’t explained this very well but I’m wondering if anyone is in the same situation  She hurts me so much and I think why it hurts more is because she can be so loving at times TL DR   does anyone anyone else have an Nparent who isn’t always awful  but their narc traits are just so so hurtful,1170,226
1620,p7brh6,0,3,does this seems like abuse  what can i do about it as a minor  hi  uh so i’m writing this because i don’t know what else to do and i thought it might be a good idea to ask in this sub  the thing is i can’t stand my mom anymore and i want to depend on her as little as possible but i don’t know how  so if anyone has any idea how i can be a little more independent  financially or otherwise  please let me know  to put it more in context  my mother has extremely narcissistic behaviors  she has never been emotionally present or has even tried to be  whenever i have tried to open up to her it has ended badly  very badly  basically any problem of mine  it has to be about her  last year i struggled a lot with anxiety but the only thing that she managed to do was to yell at me and threaten me to put me in a mental hospital  i also used to have panic attacks very frequently until one day she exploded and started throwing things at me screaming about how much of a disappointment i was to her and that i basically ruined her vacations  not to mention the other day she did the same thing because i almost fainted at school and made her wait a little too long in the parking lot  my mom tends to have many of these violent outbursts  in which she threatens to kill herself  among other things and honestly i really want to go live with my dad but i’m afraid that she’ll actually kill herself if i do so  she has already tried in the past  she also tends to be very bipolar when it comes to giving love  in that sense  i always felt that i should beg for it  do things to deserve it and until now i realize that this isn’t normal  at least in a parent  how do you even deal with a mother like this   btw i’m so sorry if this is painful to read  english is not my first language but i’m trying my best,1805,362

1622,p7blvm,0,2,Im afraid that the path Im headed down is going to kill me  I need someone to talk to   TW  To preface  I know this may not be the most appropriate place for this  I do have NParents  but this is more of a support seeking post for all of my issues and not just that one  since I dont think I could separate them even if I tried  Im a little bit desperate to be heard and to find someone to talk to so I hope its okay this once I feel so completely broken that Im not sure where to begin in asking for help  I have been through things that I would never wish on anyone and Im running out of ways to cope that wont put me in the ground  When talking to a friend stopped working years ago  I turned to self injury  That stopped working  so I turned to flat out denial  From there  it became promiscuity  And then drugs  and then alcohol  and then more severe self injury and now harder drugs  Im realizing that Im going to die if I dont help myself  and despite many years of suicidal impulses and fantasies  the thought of dying on any terms other than my own is terrifying Ive been through many professionals  I have a loving boyfriend and one or two patient friends  No family  though  And I think the two things that I desperately need  which have been missing from everything Ive tried and failed to find comfort in in the past  are  a  a person who understands on a personal level because theyve been there  and  b  a person who has that whole maternal  protective thing that Ive never gotten to experience  I cant recall a time in my entire life that Ive felt protected  even as a young child  and I think it may help me give a shit about saving my own life to believe that Im valuable enough to someone to be worth protecting If anyone at all feels like talking  I would be very grateful  I just ask that you be woman identified  non religious  and non judgmental of the things Ive had to do in order to survive  Ill also leave a heavy trigger warning here for severe child abuse  of all types   rape  self injury  suicide  and substance abuse,2075,382
1623,p7bjjt,0,11,I had to restrain my mother from attacking my sibling today  I woke at  in the morning to screams and slapping noises  My abusive parent was beating my  year old sibling for playing games overnight  and talking with her friends  Found pitiful reasons like  you are burning our electricity bills   to add to the story  while I was catching her hands in the air  or how  disrespectful  my sisters replies were  An abrupt awakening for sure  My heart was basically shaking in my chest  as I tried to calm the spirits down and find some words to take my moms head off the matter  She wasnt letting up   In fact  she got so aggressive again  that for the first time  I had to repeatedly push and restrain her out of a room  I locked the door behind me to be sure  She then went to insult me  tell me how shes going to get a lawyer to get me kicked out of the house   year old undergrad in my final year   and she proceeded to hit me on the chest a couple of times  Then  crying  she let up  and walked to her room while sobbing how our presence is destroying her life  how we made her our slave etc    Ive never seen her like this  Yes  our fights can get really bad  but this time  she behaved like a clinical patient  Like an animal that just wanted to get inside a cage to jump on her prey   She really likes making my sister the center of her problems  and lets out all her rage on my sibling   And the more she does it  the bigger the rebellious spirit of my sister grows  Right now  for the Nth time  shes threatening to oust us from the house    I dared her to take every means available to her to do so  and called my entire family to update them on the situation  I consider it somewhat scummy to try and  recruit  people to my side  but I honestly do not feel safe with this woman anymore  I want to have some net of safety and backing from people I trust  These people have cut their connections with this woman long ago  for good reason  But we are mainly counting on our divorced dad  should things go from bad to worse  And I do not wish to burden him further,2085,408
1624,p7bhxd,0,7,Self doubt and my mother Hey  first post here  I am in a tough spiral of self doubt right now  and think i might need some advice  So  here is some context  my mother  who has strong narcissistic  and BPD traits  but has never been formally diagnosed  kicked me  M  out  We have been in a cycle for  years where she would threaten me every few months that i will have to move out  This always happened spontaneously  and she was very unplanned in that regard  More so get out  i cant take it anymore  Now the thing is  im definitely guilty of a lot of things  For instance  even though never teaching me how to do it  she wanted me to do things around the house  and there were a lot of cases were i didnt do that  sometimes out of spite  often out of laziness  She also wanted me to get a proper job  which i also didnt  This had more to do with being lazy and also depressed most of the time  Now the thing is  she says her reason for kicking me out was that i didnt do better  even though promising i would  This makes me unsure if she really abused me  or if she was reacting to my obnoxiousness  It would give me some peace to know that i didnt deserve what happened and that i wasnt the villain  I know that this isnt possible to assess on reddit  but advice is still very much appreciated,1308,253
1625,p7bd4h,0,3,just a short rant to start this off  im from a rather conservative family where you’re always told to respect your elders  but its so mind blowing how they expect us to respect them yet they dont even treat us with the same respect  and whenever i do something that’s even the slightest of disrespectful in their standards  they always pull out the “im your mother father and not your friend” card  i cant even count the times when i actually tried to have a normal conversation with my mom but she always cuts me off by screaming aggressively at me  or just changing the subject entirely  its like she isn’t even listening to me  yet my dad  who’s a real enabler as much as i love him  keeps telling me to keep my composure and its just so hard when all she does is do the opposite  she always gets to treat me like shit and noone says anything to that  but the moment i say literally just ANYTHING or step in to defend my sister  we both get the same treatment  my other family members get so defensive and keep telling me to just shut up and suck it up  its so unfair  like i dont understand why they get so offended whenever i just want to tell them how that makes me feel  is something wrong with me for not respecting her like they keep telling me  just wanted to let this out since we had an argument just now again,1323,253

1638,p78sqg,0,14,Nmom put a  visitation journal  from my childhood in a box marked for me  I read it because I make bad decisions  Context  Vulnerable Nmom  alcoholic dad who could be cold angry  possible N himself  they divorced when I was young  about five Its essentially a journal documenting mostly kid exchanges from an early year in their divorce  taking me through kindergarten to first grade  It may have been the first real year in which my dad started having visitations longer than an afternoon  Im not sure if  visitation journals  are court ordered or if my mom thought she was being legally savvy or what  The super weird part is that the journaling starts about halfway through  with a bunch of blank pages beforeit Basically  the entire year its just talking about how my sibling and I would get sick after we visited my dad and then my mom would blame it on his negligence  Or shed say we were sick when we went to his house and he didnt take care of us properly   this isnt always untrue  he once tried to force me on a two day roadtrip when I was projectile vomiting from stomach flu  and he left my sibling and me at home for a church meeting while I was sick and we were too young to be alone    Occasional cringe  she said she passed by my dads house on the way home from work   his house was  not  on her way home from work   and saw us unaccompanied on the sidewalk  Once she said she left a note on his car   I dont know if such things were more normal in the time before e mail and texting  but her boundaries seemed off to me There were a few times when things she said rang true  In one  my mom was frustrated my dad wasnt offering his two cents on how to approach an illness we had and he said   You were the one who decided to get the divorce  you get to figure all these things out yourself   He made lots of cold flippant remarks like that growing up  There was another statement about a school play and how my dad attended and I waved  but he never came up to say hello  Presumably  he was avoiding my mom  She also remarked he didnt come to school to see me off on the first day of first grade and that I  never  asked where he was  Did I expect him to see me off  We werent a family anymore  Why would both be there Im not sure how much these illnesses were normal kids at germy school illnesses  how much was a hovering Nmom exaggerating to make my dad look bad  and how much was the trauma of two kids being tossed around between warring parents and not having support for emotional pain so it manifests as feeling ill instead But like    and forgive my language    why  the fuck  was this in the box my mom had set aside for me Is it wrong for me to be upset that shed put something so steeped in so much childhood trauma in a box meant for me  Like what purpose would this serve other than to manipulate me into feeling sorry for her or hating my dad If anything I just feel more resentful than ever of my parents for not worrying how these antics would damage my sibling and me  They have  deeply  My sibling and I both struggle with mental health and its really made our lives isolated and challenging  Ugh  I dont even know how to treat my mom the next time I see her since she doesnt know I read this but also clearly wanted me to at some point,3304,611

1654,p76c8q,0,13,I need a comeback  short or long  when someone says  I did it out of love  I often hear this when I try to point out how damaging someones actions were to me or other people  And its usually from Christians  I said I hated my father and he retorted saying everything he did was out of love  I have documented many instances of emotional and physical abuse from him  but that would require its own post Eg     Caning   Actions that hurt ones self esteem   How Christians handle lgbt issues   The way a lot of people handle other people who are depressed  seriously I am so sick of people telling others to just  do it  and pull yourself by your bootstraps Some I have thought of have been  How did that action show love  but I think it isnt too effectiveThis is the best one I can come up with  which comes from the bible itself  Love is patient  love is kind  It does not envy  it does not boast  it  is not proud  It does not dishonor others  it is not self seeking  it  is not easily angered  it keeps no record of wrongs  Love does not  delight in evil but rejoices with the truth    The problem comes with that last line as many will say that being lgbt is evil,1187,223
1655,p7692z,0,3,My Grandmother is a Narcissist My  f  grandmother   f  is a narcissist  I grew up in a different country than her but our limited interactions coupled with what my other family say about her confirm some pretty textbook traits  Perhaps as a result of some of the abuse by my grandmother  my mother  f  has some problematic issues that she refuses to get help for  When I was a teenager  she became a gambling addict  She is a pathological liar  she lies about things that don’t matter and things that matter a lot  She was also a lifetime smoker and now has lung cancer  which is luckily being managed  but getting accurate health information from her is damn near impossible unless I visit her provider with her  On top of the lying and the gambling  she is a martyr  All of these terrible things always happen to her despite her never doing anything wrong  She refuses to see a therapist or get help for her gambling addiction  She only quit smoking because the other option was dying  Being around her is really challenging for me  We recently had extended family in town and I had a really rough time listening to the lies and the martyrdom  I am in counseling since December but I still don’t feel like I’m making any progress with learning how to be less angry and frustrated with my mom  It seems like my best course of action would just be to see her less,1376,250
1656,p7617o,0,4,How to deal with toxic parents while I’m living at home  Hi all I am a  year old male college student and I live at home with both my parents  My mom is not the toxic one  my dad is  My whole life I’ve always sought out approval from both of them  Over time  the approval came naturally from my mom but my dad would always have a hard time with that  Anything that is going well for me in life is always rained down with his constant negativity and pessimism  I can never truly be at ease when I’m alone with him in a car ride for example  I always feel like I have to have my guard up in conversations because he will talk about something in MY life and find some way to sprinkle some negativity in it making me question myself  I’ve always had to ask for permission to go out  even now at  years old  and he’s starting to say I don’t have to anymore  But I still feel the need to hear him say “yes”  I think this is a byproduct of the many years of control he’s had over me  I am tired of his toxic behaviors and I want to free myself from him and my need for his approval once and for all  Of course it will be hard since I see him everyday because I live at home  I plan on moving out once I graduate but right now there’s not much I can do  What can I do now,1274,261

1664,p74pf1,0,7,How do I rebuild my relationship with my mom when I haven’t forgiven her for years of neglect  So my mom was the kind of parent who never believed anything I said regarding my health  For example  when I had appendicitis I ended up laying on the bathroom floor after becoming violently ill  I had to beg my mom to take me to the er and she only agreed after I told her she could take the money out of my college fund  She claimed that she only knew I wasn’t faking because I offered to pay  She was also chronically guilty of medical neglect and dental neglect  All this to say  the medical care I received because of my moms selfishness was significantly worse than average  In first grade     I got a sinus infection  It was hurting me badly and I knew something was wrong because it sounded like I had pop rocks in my nose  My mom told me I was faking it to get out of school   until it spread to my chest  I was hospitalized because X rays showed that I had an acute lung infection and I was relying on multiple nebulizer treatments a day  A side effect they didn’t catch during this hospitalization was a protein deposit left by the infection  This deposit is sitting on my triageminal nerve and has caused a condition called triageminal neuralgia  which is regarded as the most painful condition you can have  I suffered from this condition from   without any treatment and only went to the doctor when my college roommate and her mom noticed that I was suffering from symptoms which didn’t align with plain migraines  I now take heavy dosages of anti convulsants and nerve pain medications to deal with the pain  I want to hate my mom for what she did to me  In   I cut my mom off entirely and used the pandemic to justify my absence  I thought it would be the end of the issue and I could focus on healing  Around Christmas  my little brother  the golden child  pointed out that our mom has never treated me “like a person” and  for whatever reason  this resonated with our mom  She began reaching out to check on me and buying me gifts   even when it wasn’t a holiday  She has told me she wants to rebuild our relationship and a part of me does agree  if only because I want just one parent  my dad died in    but the other part of me can’t forgive her  I don’t know if it’s because she won’t accept that her medical neglect had lasting consequences but I assume a part of the issue is just that she won’t accept that I need an apology to move foreword  She has addressed the social neglect of my childhood but refuses to acknowledge that other aspects of her parenting were abusive as well  Am I wrong to hold this against her,2661,498

1670,p74cna,0,2,my n dad said he’d disown any of his kids who got vaccinated  i’ve received both doses one night my parents had a friend over to discuss vaccine conspiracy theories as some parents do  for some odd reason  and my sister was able to eavesdrop on some of their conversation  she heard my ndad say that he raised his children smart  intellectual  etc  and he’d disown anyone who received the vaccine behind his back  and so i’m going to uni in the fall and my plan to keep these vaccinations behind his back would’ve gone smoothly until my university stated that you  had  to be vaccinated to be on campus  no exceptions  my dad suspected that this was going to happen before the announcement was made and said that he wanted me to stay at home and do online school  which absolutely destroyed my mental health last year   i’ve already put in my first deposit on my house and my roommates are all expecting me to live with them so i can’t just pull out  so if i attend the university my dad will for sure know that i’ve been vaccinated  however  i’ve been wanting to go no contact or limited contact with him for a while so this could be the perfect opportunity  except i’d risk losing any help with college funds and i wouldn’t be able to see my siblings and pets very much  and i’d probably not have a place to come home to  counting down the days until my first semester has been pretty stressful especially since this could be my last year living at my house  my mom said she’d still try to help me but i’m not sure how much she can do if my dad attempts to prevent her from helping me  and usually she takes his side when we get into arguments not too sure where life will take me but it’d be nice if i could overcome this somehow,1735,326

1673,p7434n,0,21,Was called a bitch today for setting my boundaries  I found out in therapy a few years ago that my father is a narcissist  It hadn’t occurred to me until then because after years of being blamed and shamed  I had come to learn that I was the problem in our relationship  He’s always been extremely controlling and growing up  he used his authority of being the only man in the house and being a police officer to his advantage  Since therapy  I’ve learned to establish boundaries  thanks to subreddits like this    and have since spent less and less time around him  The fact of the matter is  him and my mom are still together so I often go home to visit  She and I have a great relationship and I honestly wish she divorced him years ago  However  she is the enabler and the type of woman who allows herself to get walked all over  It’s a parental recipe for disaster  Even though I am  years old  married  have a solid job  have my own mortgage and am financially independent  my dad takes every opportunity to treat me like a child   ironically only when my husband isn’t around  Today  I was at my parents’ house without my husband and he raised his voice at me for not wearing socks in the house  he doesn’t like the marks bare feet leave his on floors   Just typing that out seems absolutely ludicrous but I’m sure everyone reading this can sympathize with the ridiculous of this  I calmly told him I would put my socks on and that all he had to do was ask nicely  that he didn’t have to yell at me like I was a child  That completely set him off  He started yelling even more talking about rules I set at my condo but then I don’t abide by his in his house  I decided it was time to leave and remove myself from the situation  I packed up my things  waved goodbye and said I was going to head home  My mom was sad and my dad burst into a hysteric screaming episode saying I was being ridiculous  I calmly stated I was setting my boundaries and distancing myself since I didn’t want to be talked to like that  That’s when he blew a gasket and screamed “Now you’re just being a BITCH ” As soon as those words came out of his mouth  I knew I was making the right decision  Because he lost the control of treating me that way and talking down to me  it made him angrier  I have to go back there this weekend as my sister is coming into town for her bridal shower and am unsure of how to go about this situation  He texted me today justifying his behavior first before apologizing and saying that bitch just “slipped ” The fact he reacted with that much hostility and emotional abuse over me leaving deeply disturbs me though and I’m heavily considering going NC but am wrestling with it since I don’t want my relationship with my mom to suffer  Would love any and all advice thoughts  Also  I just want to say HUGS to all of you who are experiencing a narcissistic parent  It’s been an emotional rollercoaster the past few years and even though we all have different situations and circumstances  I appreciate this forum and the people in it ♥️,3058,572

1679,p73i4q,0,13,Hooray for generational trauma and parentification First time poster here  but Ill start with some background  I dont think my mom is a narcissist  but her mother definitely was and it definitely fucked her up  I had basically no relationship with my grandmother as a result and I think it was the right call on my moms part  Her mother died  years ago and now that Im in my s Ive started to recognize that a lot of what drives me crazy about my moms behavior can be traced to what happened to her  When I first learned the word parentification it was a lighting bolt moment because it summed up a lot of what went on when I was younger and what happened to my mom  My mom was undoubtedly parentified and I think it emotionally stunted her  Besides being abusive my grandmother was also an extremely brittle diabetic so my mom would often come home to find her mother passed out and have to revive her and my grandmother was apparently verbally abusive during this  There are countless stories like this but its clear their relationship wasnt good and getting away from her mother was the best thing that ever happened to my mom to the point of moving to the opposite side of the country where she met my dad and had me Now me  Theres that joke about  if you were called an old soul youre on at least one anti depressant now  which made me laugh in Lexapro and Wellbutrin  I very much was and everyone commented on it and by the time I was a teenager my mom seemed to not think of me as actually being a child  so I got put into the position of unpaid therapist since she and my dad were having marital problems at the time  Adult me realizes how wildly inappropriate it was but teenage me thought she was mature enough to handle it and said it was okay at the time  Adult me gets that teenage me wasnt even capable of making that call at the time and my mom should have known better than to put me in that situation  Well    maybe not so much on the last part  Because I wonder if she really didnt realize that wasnt okay for her to do to me since her mom used her the exact same way   Ive spent a lot of time working on now establishing boundaries and telling my mom that she cant use me as her unpaid therapist anymore but I still wonder exactly what her level of responsibility is here  So I guess thats my question as well as if it even matters,2378,450

1681,p73dl7,0,2,My Nmom never had a good word to say about women  and so I grew up not able to have healthy relationships with other women  Then I realized I was bi pans…help  My mom was very critical of other women  I can’t think of one adult women that my mom didn’t shit talk “Girls gossip  Girls are mean  Girls will hurt you  Girls will leave you  You’re not enough  You have to do more ”She had very strict ideas about what it took to be a good woman  and no woman could measure up  including myself  “It’s a good thing we dressed you well for your choir concert  all of the other  rd graders  were dressed like little hookers ” “I know you like that shirt  but you can’t wear it with that jacket  brown and black aren’t colors that mix well  and the other girls will laugh at you ” “Oh that  insert woman’s girls name here  is such an  insert insulting word here  who probably  insert bad behavior here  ”I think my mom wanted to be the only woman in my life and was jealous of me spending time with other girls This made me insanely nervous to talk to girls  and had I exclusively male friends  I didn’t feel like a girl  I couldn’t relate to them  I expected them to hate me Later in life  I started going through puberty and realized I was really attracted to girls  From that point on  I became a flustered blushing mess whenever I talked to girls my age  This made it impossible to have relationships with women at all  I ended up marrying a great guy  because I like boys too  and that guy knows I’m bi and says he’s okay with me flirting with girls Even thinking about flirting with a girl makes me nervous and sweaty and like a teenager with a first crush  But I still have this deep seeded fear that women will reject and hate me  All my fantasies end with a girl realizing I’m not enough and leaving  It’s heartbreaking I want to explore my sexuality  but I’m terrified of doing so  It’s a difficult spot to be in If anyone has similar stories of how they overcame something like this  I’m all ears  What can I do to move forward from this pain,2065,379

1688,p72rqf,0,6,How do narcs sabotage or control their childs life  Id like to know more about how narcissistic parents could control their child or sabotage them so that they never become independent or get married  Would it be possible to sabotage their career as well  Or their marriage  I feel crazy for thinking this and most of my family members cant see it but Im  and have never had a career or a real salary  I have made attempts but it always seems to never work out  I have never seen a yearly income of    or above and I have a business marketing degree  I also studied design and was heavily discouraged and competed against by my family  I wound up marrying a very talented designer and my brother tried to completely switch careers to go work at a design agency  He also tried to rip off my husbands design that he created from scratch and my Mother thinks he is an angel  My entire family competes with us and we were not supported by my parents when we got engaged  My mother took my wedding dress and claims she lost it    she has taken other things that belonged to me too  AND  she literally went through some of the wedding gifts and wouldnt allow me to take some of the gifts home  Later she gave me some weird distorted answer saying she thought my husband opened them which made NO sense  My mother has told family members NOT to call me  when I told her to leave me alone and she took it as her mission to tell people to not contact me  I cant prove that they control things but at this moment I have  savings   money in the bank and am living in their house with our child WITHOUT my husband due to covid because      wait for it    they claim that the house is too small and my husband cant stay here  So now we are living like a divorced couple and my husband is not even allowed to stay over or hardly even come over  He doesnt get to see his child  yet they are practically raising her  They told people my husband was a drunk after he was sent to the ER for having a complete break down and vitamin deficiency  They snubbed him and somehow tried to drive wedge between us but all these things I can not pin point and I feel like I am going crazy  I wish I could prove everything  My Dad is HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE  He is mean and verbally abusive and the entire family says  oh but hes a gentle nice guy  you should have compassion for him  The man ruined my entire life by screaming at me and my brother for years and ruining my ability to problem solve  I also now have memory problems and social anxiety  He sometimes would humiliate me in front of my friends too So I am so flustered by them and their behavior  there is just soo much that I can barely make sense of  so I apologize if some of this is just random  I am wondering how can one find out if they are playing games  being manipulative  or controlling when narcs do passive things and then claim they never did anything  I mean my father always  always tries to push me out of the way when I am in the kitchen cooking for the baby  or if I cook for them he stands next to me and tries to compete with me    literally  It makes you give up when they interfere like that but how can you prove it  That is also my question  how could you prove you arent crazy and they are,3267,627
1689,p72aka,0,16,Was it abuse  People with experience with abuse  please help me make sense of my childhood   I have never been sexually abused or physically beaten the way other people have been  but I would still describe my childhood as difficult and abusive  Unfortunately  people do not think of other people as victims of abuse  unless they can come up with one single shocking traumatic event  Story of my life  Sorry for the long post  I already tried to shorten it and left many things out  Here are some of the things behaviors that happened throughout my childhood  in no particular order  My mom is a hoarder and has had very weird  intense  uncontrollable temper tantrums  Sometimes she would walk through our apartment  pulling her hair and punching herself in the head while screaming  Sometimes we had to wade through trash  and we had a lot of rotten and spoiled food at home  some of which was served to us  I had an eating disorder as a child and have never been too fond of eating to this day  She would sing uncontrollably and very loud in the kitchen  like a maniac  and my friends who came to visit would get scared  It was like in a mental hospital  really  My mom and my dad would regularly get into violent fights  sometimes involving kitchen knives  food or furniture being thrown at each other  Many things in our household were destroyed in my childhood and everyone took part in it  There is still a hole in the kitchen door today  from when my mom threw a knife at my dad My dad was an alcoholic and chain smoker  he also smoked inside  He often drove me around when he was very drunk and kept talking to me about how he would die soon  We were in bad accidents  one time the car spun over and landed on its roof on the highway   he lost his drivers license etc  at that time I didn’t care if I would die When I was  years old  he locked himself in the bathroom and announced to kill himself  I was crying outside  knocking at the door  begging him not to do it  This haunted me for many years My dad often used to disappear when he would go outside to run some errands and returned late in the night  sometimes with blood on his face from falling over  Sometimes he got into fights or the police would bring him home  even though he was never violent towards us   It was very embarrassing  since all our neighbors and many of my friends who lived in the same street were witness to it  My dad caused some very embarrassing situations  some of which I don’t want to mention here  He was always in debt and personified chaos For more than a decade and a half  my parents had very aggressive  vulgar  South Park got nothing on my parents and I learned as a baby how to seriously cuss  and frightening fights  for us as children  on a daily basis My mom would send us  around  and year old siblings  around the neighborhood to go look for my dad  even if it was in the middle of the night  One Christmas my dad disappeared  when he was out to go and get a Christmas tree  She sent us to look for him  We were scared to death and roaming the neighborhood looking for him holding hands  We found his car two subway stations away and he was in the trunk  so drunk that his eyes were rolled back  We dragged him back home and got ridiculed for it by people passing by  Well he got ridiculed  but we were ashamed to death  It really left a mark on us  Situations like this happened regularly  That day Christmas died for me and I have never liked it ever since  My mom never breastfed me and was very proud of it   She once told me when I was little  “Never make the same mistake as me and have children”  My sister   years older  used to change my diapers when I was a baby  She told me that I had rashes from my parents not changing my diapers for days  We never had any kind of connection  from the beginning As mentioned  my mom used to engage in very bizarre and odd behavior  Here are some examples  When we would take a shower  she would always use the hot water in the kitchen  which would turn the water ice cold in the bath tub  Every single time  Over many years  My sister and me used to get very mad at her for this  because it was so annoying  She would always have us wait at the lunch table for at least    minutes when food was already served and complain  violently and aggressively  if we already started eating and would also always make sure that she took  minutes more than us  after each of us finished  And we always had to wait for her  During vacations or daytrips  she would always walk at least  meters behind us and every time we would stop to wait for her  she would stop and wait until we would continue walking  Sometimes we lost her  One time she got robbed by a pickpocket and we screamed and gesticulated at her from afar  that someone was opening her purse  She stuck her fingers in her ears  as she would always do  when someone said something she didn’t want to hear  She always complained about everything and everyone being too loud but it was her who was screaming in a very annoying and aggressive way  All the time   She stole     which my dad saved for me starting when I was born  wasted it and lies to this day about it to me  My sister received the money  She liked my sister a little bit better than me and supported her in her career  while everything I was ever doing was stupid  senseless and I am not good enough for anything  She didn’t like men very much and any kind of affection for that matter  She never told me that she loved me or showed any affection  my dad was able to do that  despite his fuckups   Harsh criticism that borders  and sometimes involved hatred  and no affection or reassurance ever for me  I was her biggest mistake  She had vulgar explosions of anger that remind me of the movie The Exorcist  Really  you wouldn’t believe it  if you saw her  My wife didn’t believe me  until she saw it herself  Nobody knows she is like this  besides us  The rest of the world thinks she is a very nice and kind lady and they don’t understand what is wrong with me and why I am not thankful for this nice little lady  When my dad got terminally ill with cancer  she used to beat him up  He wasn’t able to defend himself anymore because he was slowly on the way out  Every time she demanded something stupid or ridiculous of me and I wouldn’t oblige  she would beat him up  I would get a call by him  begging me to comply with her will next time  because otherwise she would beat him up again  It made me angry like you wouldn’t believe  which didn’t make the situation better  One time I caught her attacking him and grabbed her by the collar  I told her that I would knock her the fuck out  if she ever touched my dad again  who was very very ill  I am not proud of it  but I was sooo angry  I never went hungry  well  let me correct myself  she always used to cook very small portions  because she thought eating too much isnt good  so often times I left the lunch table hungry  Later when I would visit them I ate in advance  knowing she would either cook very little or something disgusting  To this day  when I cook  I compulsively cook too much  always having that fear in mind to go to bed hungry   had toys  went on some nice vacations  but it still messed me up that it is affecting me to this day  My mom isn’t an inherently evil person and she has some good in her  she just never loved me and always used me as her punching bag with no mercy  I have had huge issues regarding women for a very long time My dad died  years ago  my mom is still alive  I feel indifferent towards her and I feel sorry for her  But I don’t love her  What are your thoughts on this Thanks for reading through this and any input is welcome  I left many things out  but this is too long already  so I am thankful for any opinion,7836,1475

1692,p726q8,0,9,Is it shameful to have done bad things  Am I a bad person if I’ve done bad things  My biggest fear in life is being a bad person  My mom was an asshole growing up who always criticized everything I did  who was always cold towards me  compared me to others  etc  I was never capable enough  didn’t work hard enough  wasn’t mature enough  etc  But  most of all  I was never enough of a good person  There was always this theme in our relationship of her looking down on me and being disappointed and upset with me as a person  From the age of six onwards  I can remember feeling a deep sense of shame about myself and felt like I didn’t deserve to exist in life  I’ve been in therapy for four years now  I’m    My therapists over the years have tried very hard to ingrain in me that I’m not a bad person  but I find it very  very hard to believe  The thing is  I’ve done some messed up things throughout my life as a result of untreated feelings and issues from my childhood  I won’t bore you all with the details  but I’m no saint  For this reason  I can never  ever rid myself of this core childhood pain  this fear  that I’m a bad person  I walk around everyday with this fear that people will find out I’m bad  with this feeling of deep shame that I am even taking up space in the world  overthinking all of my actions and trying so hard everyday to be “perfect” to ensure that I never do anything bad ever again  But it never works  I inevitably end up messing up  and sometimes messing up big time and doing something really bad    I don’t know what to do about all of this  I’ve often told my therapists that I think I would be more accepting of the fact that I am not a bad person  that I would be more compassionate towards myself  if society treated “being a good person” as a skill to be learned akin to learning to ride a bike or learning how to cook  If society didn’t shame people who have done bad things so much and make them feel like shit  I would probably be a lot softer and compassionate towards myself  But  the thing is  I am not the world’s best person  I’m no saint  I’m working hard everyday to correct the fucked up behaviors from childhood  but it’s harder for me than other people because I am learning all of this now as an adult  I don’t want to spend every waking moment worrying about whether something I’m doing is bad or fucked up because that sort of perfectionism makes me hate myself more  but I feel like I have to because the world doesn’t treat morality or “being a good person” the same way they treat learning other skills  I often see people online  on Twitter and Reddit  especially places like r AmITheAsshole   completely shame and crucify those who fuck up in some way  and it makes me eternally afraid of ever doing anything wrong and makes me hate myself for all the bad things I did in my past  My question is  how do I rid myself of the shame and fear I have about being a bad person when other people make it seem like I deserve to feel ashamed for those things  Or do I deserve to feel guilty and ashamed for my fuck ups after all  Do they make me a bad  shameful person,3134,598

1705,p706vt,0,4,Manufacturing reasons for contact I write and sometimes publish poetry  My late father also wrote poetry  but published very little in his lifetime  After he died  five and a half years ago  my mother brought out a self published volume of his poems  I helped to compile that  though she ignored my suggestion of leaving out some weaker  possibly unfinished pieces  and wrote the foreword  I never asked about sales  but would be surprised if my mother recouped the publishing costs  My mother and I have always had a toxic relationship  see my post history  and I went NC over two years ago  Well  initially I meant to go VLC  but within two weeks of my asking her not to contact me till further notice  she was emailing me with the excuse of discussing some poems Id recently published  That made me realise that blocking all contact was the only way forward  I havent regretted it once  Recently shes been trying to contact me again about  rights to the poetry   I dont know whose poetry  because I only saw the subject line as the email disappeared into the void  but I assume its my dads   I retain copyright over my own work   and she should know this   She holds the copyright now as his heir  so I guess its about who shes going to leave it to in her will  Dad wasnt a bad poet  bless him   but far better poets have been forgotten  The odds of anyone wanting to republish his poetry  or of it earning any money  are incredibly low  There is no pressing reason for her to contact me about this  and I know from experience that shes trying to manipulate me  picking a subject she thinks I cant resist to worm her way back into my life  Its so transparent and it makes me so angry,1705,311

1709,p6zfgs,0,4,My son will be born in  months but I feel deeply depressed    Hello  guys I don’t engage much with the community here on Reddit  but I’m always lurking around  This is the only social media that I really enjoy using I need some advice I’m writing this because I don’t have many friends that I can share this stuff with and my anxiety has been tearing me apart I’m  years old and currently going through some really bad stuff in my head that I’m having trouble processing I need to take this off my chest and I thought this would be a good place to express myself and maybe someone could help me out  People here are usually quite wholesome  cheerful and wise So… months from now I will become a father I am really excited about it and I love my fiancée very much  This girl literally changed my life I came from a very poor and messed up family  I grew up without a father and had a really resentful mother who was very negative and toxic I have so much shit inside me  so much hate and sadness about how my family treated me growing up  I have nightmares about it every other day  it sucks I used to cry almost every night about my mother ignoring the fact that a member of her family raped me when I was a child  Seriously  this isn’t the kind of thing I can simply ignore  it causes me a lot of daily pain As I grew up I turned into a cold  manipulative person  I told horrible lies and used people as it pleased me  I’ve hurted so many people along the yearsBut then I met Sabrina She was this super dorky girl who worked as a teacher and had such a pure heart  She really is the best person I’ve ever met We met  years ago through an ex friend and then we started dating immediately  After only a year  we decided to live together During this time I cheated on her several times I was having affairs at work  seeing hookers frequently and on top of this I was snorting cocaine everyday I had this wonderful girl that I was putting through so much horrible stuff  And she loved me so  so  so very much   In time  I started to feel very guilty But soon COVID  hitted and things got really bad here in Brazil Our money situation got critical and we couldn’t pay rent anymore  so we had to go back and live at my mom’s house During these hard times  I was starting to feel something different inside Through time  Sabrina was making me feel more open and honest with her and myself Her kindness inspired me and the love I felt for her made me want to change because I couldn’t bear feeling that guilt anymore I didn’t want to hurt her anymore  she was too good to me…But I was so scared of her finding out the horrible things I’ve done   At this point an immense struggle started happening inside of me and I began to reflect upon the concepts of good and evil As I started to be honest with myself I realized how much of a shitty person I was… and it was really hard to accept that In July  I confessed everything I told her everything I’ve done behind her back and who I really was  This was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life She cried so much  it looked like she was vomiting pain… I felt like a monster I was a monter She broke up with me and went away to a friend’s house  She lived with her friend for a while Sabrina doesn’t have any family  Her parents don’t give a fuck about her existence and they live at the other side of the country She was feeling like she never knew me at all and must have felt so alone…At this point I was really trying to be a better person  I started to study the concept of good and evil which got me into philosophy  buddhism  psychology and mysticism I was desperate to cast this monster out and find some good in myselfI tried so hard to change myself and help Sabrina  She was living in really bad conditions over at her friend’s house But after some months  her friend kicked her out and she had no choice but to come back to live with me at my mother’s house Yeah  I know that sounds like an obvious bad move but I couldn’t leave her homeless  It was the only viable option And things between us were bad Even though she was trying to make things work between us  it was obvious she resented me a lot We talked about this  tried to sort things out  There was a lot of crying and guilt and resentment  It was really ugly Situation was really stressful because we had no money and my mother was treating us like shit  like she really hated us for being there I was spiraling in depression The house was dark  smelled like cigarettes and cheap beer Watching how my mother was living and what she has turned into after years of being a sad person was killing me inside Some time later  Sabrina got a job as a gym receptionist in a dangerous favela here in Rio Things with my mom got worse After a big argument over something stupid  my mother tried to hurt Sabrina  That’s when she decided to just leave and sleep on the streets rather than keep living with me like that I remember having a complete mental breakdown that day  And in a very dark way  I also remember noticing that my mom looked quite entertained by my own despair Luckily  the lady who owned the gym in which Sabrina worked gave her the key so she could sleep on the gym’s floor Meanwhile  things here in Brazil were crazy  It was impossible to find a job  no one was hiring  corruption scandals over hospitals  vaccines  amp  shit Everything was pretty apocalyptic by that time I started doing some graphic designs on Canva and made a bit of money on freelancer com  Started studying SEO  Copywriting and did some jobs online My English was also pretty decent because I spent my entire childhood playing RPG games on my Playstation So I started teaching English  I only had one student  but that’s an improvement  right Time has passed and Sabrina got back to teaching  Soon enough she was back on her feet and rented an apartment This amazing girl is a freaking heroine  I know Meanwhile  I was making internal progress  confronting my demons and trying really hard to be a good person while also trying to help my mother But living with my mom was putting me in a really dark place…And that’s when Sabrina got pregnant  We were still seeing each other every other day  so it kinda happened accidentally I am really grateful for her forgiveness  I am very grateful for having this second chance   At first I was really scared  but Sabrina didn’t think twice She said that she would be raising our kid whether I was going to be a part of it or not Two months ago she invited me to move in together  even though I’m making less than a U D  around  Reais in our currency  per month I am very happy for finally being forgiven by this women  but now I’m battling against this feeling of being a fucking deadweight on her life Our relationship is better than ever and I’ve been taking care of Sabrina with all my heart She is a pregnant woman  working her ass off  paying rent  taking care of me and our dog financially Sabrina is the strongest and kindest person I know As she is juggling a lot of classes to make money  I sit at my computer and try to score any freelancing job I can But things are rough right now Soon she won’t be able to work anymore  she’s  months pregnant  and I’m not providing yet I’ve sent out so many resumés  tried out so many ways of making money online…Even though Sabrina and I have been very happy together  we are starting to get worried about our situation I’m trying my hardest  I really am  I try to keep the house spotless clean  I cook for her  take care of our dog Everyday I get on the internet and try to score some gig so I can help out  but… fuck  I’m starting to feel like a useless piece of shit…I feel small  pathetic and powerless  Maybe that’s stupid  but I feel like less of a man…With all that happening inside me  emotionally  I closed myself off to the world I don’t talk to anyone else except Sabrina because I feel so ashamed of myself Also I changed so much because of everything that happened that I don’t even know how to introduce my new being to my old friends My friends reach out and ask if I’m okay but I always end up ignoring them    and this hurts me so much because I miss affection and validation from friends like everyone else…I just feel like I don’t want people to see me until I fix my situation   And this has been going for a while now  I feel so alone and worthless and ashamed to let anyone see me like this It got to a point that I decided to live my life to serve my family  Not as a penitence  but because it’s really the only way I can feel good about myself again   I promised myself I will serve my wife Sabrina  my son Raziel and my dog Coyote Today I woke up  made breakfast and cleaned the apartment for my wife She left for work and I tried to write some stuff for an idea I had to get some English students I’ve always been quite a nerd  so I’m working on this idea of teaching English classes through tabletop RPG games As I tried to work on my project today  I felt really sad…There is a rage of feelings and fear inside of me  I often have nightmares about my family or losing Sabrina As the days go by  I feel that my anxiety gets better because Sabrina helped me break free of my mother’s toxicity But yet  it feels like I still have a long way to go…After some time of us not speaking  my mother texted me yesterday and said she missed me  It made my heart ache again  really bad Today I kept trying to write stuff for my English teaching project or to just get stuff done around the house but…Fuck  I feel bad But… I have no time to just feel depressed  I need to provide for my family and the clock is ticking My son is about to be born and I feel so powerless How do I make this feeling go away   Tell me  friends from Reddit  how do I stop feeling so overwhelmed by my own sadness Now that I am trying to be honest with myself and my own feelings I realize that this is almost impossible Facing life with honesty is really hard and I’m trying my best  but…How do you guys do this  Adult life is kicking my ass and facing it with honest emotions are just making it even harder As the days go by  life feels lighter and brighter  It’s been a while since I had nightmares and my mind feels clearer But there’s still this fear that I have to conquer inside myself of not being able to provide for my family   I guess that’s what it means becoming a father  right Well  anyway  thanks for reading I really needed to get this off my chest,10682,1912

1717,p6ylcc,0,4,TW SEXUAL ABUSE    How do I start a legal case against my dad  How do I start the legal process against my dad for molesting me and my little brother  I’m f  will be  in April  he is m I plan on taking custody and most likely leaving my mom as well  We will be staying with my bfs family in our own room and I already have a plan to relatively quickly transition us into a stable apartment and give us the best life we can have  I will be doing contracting work and making hundreds per job almost daily  it’s all set in stone  My bfs dad is the kindest person I’ve ever met second only to my bf and is more than happy to let me and my brother stay their spare bedroom as long as we need  I actually will be working with him for the contracting  I also have my own car and although I have a provisional license  I am allowed to drive myself and my little brother to school work  and in three months I’ll be able to take the drivers test and get my full license  I’ve began collecting what little evidence I do have which is primarily screenshots of searches he has made on his devices to see his step daughter  my older sisters nudes  an email which I have been documenting as much detailed abuse as possible  me and my brothers testimony  I found a local facility that will help with getting my brothers testimony and they do it in a very comforting non pressuring way and they film it so he doesn’t have to repeat it to fifty different people and they can help me get my brother into counseling  So far legally all I understand about guardianship is that to prove I can handle him I need to show I can provide housing  essentials  medical care  and stability  For immediate housing  we have a spare bedroom at my bfs house however I have a clear and detailed plan of the work that I   will be doing and a list of apartments that one we will move in to when I have the money  Since I will be working Immediately I will be able to provide clothes  food  doctors visits etc and someone who is willing to support us as back up  Stability wise  again I will be stable working and have options for a second job on top of that  I plan on enrolling my brother immediately in counseling through the facility that will help with the interview  I myself am mentally stable and ever since I was his age I’ve been raising him myself  I changed His diapers fed him bottles and food put him to sleep gave him baths and have always been his emotional support  He would tell anyone if asked that I am here for him and the one he goes to and he has stated in the past without me even prompting the conversation that he wants to live with me  I just really need to figure out what the legalities here are and what the process will look like and what steps I need to take for that and how to get a guardianship lawyer if I need one  Additionally I need to decide if we leave this month or if we are willing to wait in this hell hole another two months to see if our mom who has temporarily moved in will be able to get a house  see other post for current situation details  and hopefully not relapse  But again their are a million things that can go wrong with her and I originally planned on after we move in with her taking my brother anyways just it would be easier from her house and I wouldn’t have to burden my bf and his dad  Thank you for any and all advice,3359,654

1725,p6xq4j,0,2,At least you can take some time to dissect text messages as opposed to offhand verbal abuse     TW  Gaslighting Abusive Narcissistic Messages      You know how they talk  If you cant stand that  please dont read this  I just want to see what people think of some of the things my  f  nMom  f  has been saying recently  I keep thinking Im going crazy  the gaslighting is getting to me Im sure  Im currently forced to live with her because my only other option is homelessness  Im trying to get a job but I have severe anxiety and my job coach has been    slow  Applying is terrifying and Im dissociating most of the day  which makes me feel like Im not trying  Cant get emergency housing  have no relatives  friends  or anyone I could stay with instead  that arent also abusive   For context  I have a car  but my nMom has been using it since I was forced to move back in with her  It ran okay before  but its old  and shes completely destroyed the thing  The car wont even start unless its jumped  and it has to be driven constantly or else the battery will die  Ive asked her repeatedly to please fix it  because I have no money  and shes said she has but obviously if it keeps doing that it isnt fixed   She says it doesnt need to be fixed  it needs to be driven which is just an excuse to make me feel like Im not being responsible and for the car to be unavailable when I need it the most   AKA leaving Heres the first message  sent August th  Around  am  gt   Good morning       My Deadname       I want to say to you that I have been nice long enough about your car I haven’t yelled I haven’t come on glued yet and I was nice enough to get your car started for you  But today is my breaking point and if your car is not moved out of that man’s parking spot by the time I get home from work I am going to blow a gasket literally your car needs to be started driven and taken care of and I am not gonna be nice anymore I’ve absolutely had it I do love you though  For more context  I hadnt driven the car in months  she had been driving it  and she was the one who put it in our neighbors parking spot  I dont even know where visitor parking is  Notice how she says  I was nice enough  as if she actually did something lmao  She jumped my car out of the kindness of her heart yet didnt park it in the right spot   And blames it on me  How surprising  And for the record  I did go out there and see if the car would start  another surprise  it didnt start  I have ADHD and I forget the car even exists most of the time  which is why I cant just drive it every day either She sent this message later in the day when she got home from work  gt   I’m going out for a beer   When I get home that car better be moved or the internet is off   And it will not be turned on again until you can be responsible to take care of your car  clean your bathroom and bedroom  and you are paying rent  Internet is a privilege that you haven’t earned   I do love you   But you need to show some responsibility and respect   Shes been threatening that I need to pay rent since I moved here three years ago  Yes  I still havent been able to get a job  I know  Doesnt exactly feel great  I kinda feel worthless actually  But when I first moved in I had been kicked out by my nDad  who had promised me college and that hed help me get a job  only to kick me out because his eGirlfriend was more important  later eWife   I moved in depressed  anorexic  and straight up not having a good time  My anxiety is really bad  and my CPTSD from my parents gives me a huge fear of failure  so much so that I worry more about being a burden to my hypothetical employers than I do about still being abused here  Not fun  Shes also threatened the internet frequently enough over the time Ive been here  which is just her flaunting her control over me  really  Plus  my only chance at a job is online work so of she keeps me from using the internet I literally cannot save up to leave  Id say shes also threatening my healthy communication with friends but I dont have friends  Whoops  I told her after this that I did go out and try to start the car  but she brushed it off and didnt care   Almost like she just wanted to complain at me and be the center of attention    Hmmmmmmm kinda sus buddy She sent me this a few hours ago  gt   How about if you’re not going to talk to me  or help with anything around the house without being paid  you move to your dads house  I deserve more respect  I deserve love   If you have no respect for me and no love for me  you are free to go to your dads or your own apartment   I’m giving you and your       Sibling       until January st to get jobs and pay rent  utilities and groceries  move  or be enrolled in school  The choice is yours  No more free rides  It’s for your own good  Because I love you both   Once again  for context  Ive been doing my best to avoid her this past month or    six  I do my best to say in my room  and only come out to eat or shower etc  I havent spoken to her face to face for a few days  and when that happens she claims that Im ignoring her  She even perpetuates it by purposefully trying to come home as late as possible  when Ive already gone to bed   But I try to go to bed by the time she gets home so I can eat when shes asleep  Lately Ive just been not going downstairs at all when shes home  though   Its hilarious that shes threatening me with this  because I know what she really wanted to say was  dont get a job  apply for college instead so you can keep staying with me and being my supply   Thats what the point of this was  I think  She doesnt actually want me to leave  Shes been purposefully keeping me from leaving since I got here  which is part of the reason as to why its been so hard in the first place So whats so bad about moving back in with my nDad  then  His eWife  actually  I hate everything she stands for  Shes insanely racist  homophobic  transphobic  the lot   I mean  my whole family is  but   The last time I saw my nDad I made the mistake of bringing up how the minimum wage isnt a living wage and things just got worse from there  until I was crying on my way out the door  He sat in front of me while I was having a breakdown and told me I wasnt trying and my generation is lazy  how hes done everything for me and Im ungrateful and attacking him  I brought up my nMoms abuse  his abuse  and his eWifes abuse  and his reply was well at least I didnt hit you   He did by the way lmaooo  His eWife is very I deserve respect because I exist and anything that isnt exactly what I said is disrespect  She abused her children  too  who abuse their children as well  How wonderful  So yeah  things are shit right now  I just wanted someone to tell me I wasnt going crazy  and that this isnt okay  Its really hard being isolated for so long  I dont have anyone to remind me that I didnt do anything wrong  The global panini didnt change a single thing about my situation besides my nMom inviting c positive people to live with us  which was fun   Thats sarcasm  I hope to fuck Im not gonna end up sick in a few days   Again  all Im able to do is dissociate most of the day  Applying to jobs is incredibly stressful  and my ADHD paralysis makes it even harder to start  I dont have any work experience  and Im even terrified to work because I worry Ill screw something up  I have a job coach  but shes got cancer and is struggling herself  so I dont even have her working full time to help me  plus she has other clients   I havent been taught anything about anything  including taxes  paychecks  literally any adult shit  So going in blind makes it even worse  which makes it hard to even start  Looking at job listings actually makes me cry because I get so overwhelmed  Every time I just get lost in it sometimes  Lost in the story my nParents write  Its insane how they completely insert their own self obsessed bullshit into the core beliefs of fucking children  How they convince us that were worthless and have no worth outside of praising them  Im so deprived that phone calls with doctors and my job coach are just a few words away from becoming a therapy session  And I get stuck between forcing my FAWN response on random people  because my trauma makes me expect them to be upset for literally nothing  and desperately begging for help for myself  Its mental  Did I mention were in a housing crisis and in many places in the US that sleeping in your car is illegal   So even if my car did work thats not an option how awesome  D  I wouldnt have internet connection if I had an online job anyways so living in my car isnt sustainable anyways      Speaking of   if you have some living homeless tips Id greatly appreciate it     because    well,8878,1659

1728,p6x7aw,0,5,Im at my wits end TW MENTIONS IF SUICIDE AND SELF HARMI need an anonymous place to rant so here it is  Im immensely dumfounded by my mothers approach to parenting  When I was  it came to my schools attention that I had been self harming  they informed her of course and she had one short conversation with me about it and it was never brought up again  The school wanted to organise an appointment with the nurse to discuss this and when I attended she had called my mum beforehand and the two of them decided I was just  trying it out  because I had friends that did it  Everything I told the nurse after that was pointless because shed made up her mind  Honestly this absolutely enrages me because I was actually trying to get help at the time and if I had gotten it I wouldnt be covered in scars like I am now  More recently my depression hit the lowest its ever been and I finally sought help  I told my parents about it  more because my sister was worried about me than because I wanted to  Again she barely mentioned it except to ask me  why are you actually depressed  Like what reason    Due my depression Ive been signed off of work multiple times during different break downs and all shes done is tell me Im going to lose my job and I cant quit because no one will ever hire me again if I do  I told her my job genuinely makes me want to kill myself and she just said  oh come on thats a bit much  I responded  well no Im literally depressed  but she just shrugged that off  Shes genuinely the kind of person thatll treat me like that but if I ever did commit suicide shed be announcing to everyone how hard she tried to help me etc   Ive been exploring online at the possibility of me having ADHD as its been a running joke in my family that I have it and I think itd really put everything into perspective for me  She doesnt even want to entertain this and clearly thinks its ridiculous despite my therapist urging me to speak to a doctor about it because she thinks its likely  I mentioned to her that Ive seen a lot of people get questionnaires for their family to fill out about any behaviour they may have noticed and all she said  very bluntly was  hm well see   She also started informing me of all her marital issues and just bad mouthing my dad whenever he isnt around  My dad isnt a perfect man but these grievances she has are honestly ridiculous and most of the time I can see where hes coming from  For example  she wanted to take a large amount of money from HIS pension to redo the house and he said no  he gave no reason but its no secret that shes terrible with money to the point where Ive had to pay her mortgage and loan her money frequently  Shes also particularly annoyed when my dad is unwell  he has lung disease and often gets infections that are quite serious  she says she has no sympathy for the  dying duck  act and gets angry when hes clearly struggling but if she were ill it would be a completely different story   I cant even talk about any of this with her because if I even imply shes a bad parent all hell would break loose  It would all be flipped onto me and shed stop talking to me all together which isnt ideal as Ive recently had to move back home  Something in me today snapped during dinner  i was talking to my dad and she just loudly cut me off to inform him of some stupid post shed seen on Facebook  I just felt defeated and stayed silent for the rest of my meal  Its becoming more and more clear that she doesnt care about anything that isnt to do with her and I just dont know how to cope anymore  If any of you stuck around this long thank you for taking the time to listen to a depressed bitch complain,3723,710

1734,p6wmws,0,7,My anti vaxxer parents Sorry for posting here  times today but I just had a brief touch on the covid subject with my narc parents and I just couldnt believe the amount of lies they spewed on me  My NF has always believed the virus is a hoax  conspiracy cooked up by the evil government  and he keeps saying this to absolutely anyone willing to listen  My NM thinks Covid is JUST a flu in spite of the examples I gave her of my friends with sick parents in the hospital  My mother even has friends acquaintances who were in the hospital from Covid and she talked to them after recovery  YET shes still in complete denial of how severe this virus is  As you imagine theyre both unvaxxed and theyll never touch the vaccine  Unfortunately  theyre in the vulnerable category high blood pressure  obesity etc  So my fear is that  when Ill call them later on in a couple of months  theyll both be fighting the virus AND  theyll continue to deny the virus affected them in any way  Of course I am worried for them because they barely practice social distancing but I cant do anything about it  No one is able to convince these people that were currently dealing with the most dangerous flu virus that had ever been around and Im weary theyll suffer the consequences of that  Its so sad and ridiculous if you ask me  Are your narcissistic parents ad in denial of the pandemic as mine  How are you dealing with their delusion on a mental level,1464,263

1738,p6wflr,0,2,Scared for my future Hi everyone  I’ve never actually spoken to anyone about my parents before  so this is a bit scary  but I’m having a really tough time right now and just need a safe place to rant and get advice Here’s some context  sorry but this is gonna be a long one…When I was  my parents forced me to move  hours from my hometown even though I had taken a very long time to find a stable friend group  and was finally happy  I had a really hard time with bullying and getting used to the new requirements standards at my new school  so eventually I decided to move to an online school  This was a hard time in my life but on the bright side I ended up graduating like  months early  while I was still  Since I was still considered out of state I told my parents that my plan was to work for the rest of the year and then to start college when I was  like I would have if I had graduated at my normal time  I didn’t want to pay x as much to start school early  and I was only making   an hour at the time  so I figured saving up and starting normally was the smartest thing to do  My parents were furious over this and forced me to start college at  because “they weren’t going to foot my bills for any longer than they had to” and because “I wasn’t owed anything just for being alive ”I ended up only taking  classes that first semester because it was all I could afford  and  classes the following one  This is what most people take in a single semester  but my parents refer to this as “my first year” and have told me that I need to finish up my entire degree in  more years or I’m going to be kicked out This has put huge strain on me both emotionally and financially by forcing me to take  classes some semesters  and by forcing me to pay for summer classes out of pocket to get caught up  My parents are very well off financially  and told me my whole life they would “help” pay for my school  but they have paid barely any at this point  and won’t even allow me to go to the doctor unless I pay for it  Currently I’m in the midst of my junior year  but because of some messed up shenanigans and the pandemic  I am only given the   sophomores get in Federal loans  Because of this I still have a few grand each semester I have to pay out of pocket  not counting books  parking passes  etc  I’m trying very hard to avoid private loans because starting pay for my future career is only k  so I need to be very careful with how much debt I incur  as well as with interest rates  Before I could just work I order to pay this  but as I get farther into my degree  I’m an education major  I’m starting to have field placements and much harder classes that are making it difficult for me to reasonably work more than  hours a week  I am on campus from am to pm  days a week and I work  hours every weekend  but it’s not enough  I also have   I need to come up with for summer classes again this summer  but I don’t know how I’m going to make it  My school just keeps hitting me with more and more fees  and my parents blame it all on my “laziness ”All of this is starting to take a tole on me  I’m exhausted all the time  I’ve noticed my driving is getting bad  I’m having awful nightmares  I don’t eat well  my grades are slipping  and even my coworkers have noticed that “I always seem sad ” I feel like I’m not strong enough to do what I need to on my own  and I’m scared  Now onto my parents… My parents are the kinds of parents who like to pass of neglect as a life lesson  Despite being very well off financially they would very often refuse to buy me clothes that fit as a kid  take me to the doctor dentist regularly  or even to cook meals regularly  They always justified this by telling me that “that’s life” or by repeating their mantra… “you aren’t owned anything just for being alive ” They also had issues with alcohol when I was younger as well as with allowing my   year old family members to drink and behave badly in front of me  but this grew better over time They constantly threaten me financially  and will threaten to kick me out over small things like leaving a cup on the counter  or forgetting to turn off a lamp  And as I mentioned before  they refuse to pay for any of my college  and I’m struggling with that as well  I have a very difficult time accepting help from anyone because growing up “help” was always something that would get held over my head later on  My parents would rarely do nice things for me  but when they did  there was always a price  My mother would often tell me she was going to buy me things only to make me put them back at the checkout counter stating that “daddy will scream at me if I spend too much ” This was often done with clothing  school supplies  etc  They also very much like to “embellish” their past accomplishments and then use them as an excuse to call me lazy  The current lie they like to manipulate me with is…“Your mother paid for her    a year degree when she was making   an hour  She didn’t have any loans  so you don’t have any right to complain ”This is blatantly false and would mean that my mother would have somehow managed to work  hours a week   weeks out of the year  all while being a full time student  A quick google search also shows that tuition to her college was    a year when she went  not     Anyways  I feel like over getting a bit sidetracked  and this is way too long  so let me put it simply…  My parents don’t give off the vibe that they like me  let alone love me    They treat me like a huge burden  and for years have made me feel guilty for being alive   I have a hard time taking about this with anyone because they don’t physically abuse me  and because we are well off financially  I feel like an ungrateful crybaby a lot of the time   They make me feel like everything wrong with the world is my fault  and lie to me in order to make me feel inadequate   I am scared for the future of my finances as well as for my schoolingI’m sorry this was so long  but I really just needed to rant  and writing this felt good  Does anyone else here have similar circumstances  and if so  how are you managing  how did you manage  Thank you,6249,1204
1739,p6wf03,0,2,Fucking why My nmom is obsessed with me   Just gonna say it  I had hunches but at this point I am pretty sure that obsession is the right word  amp  xB I have been buying shirts off redbubble  They are just cool shirts that are personal to me   but I can also get away with wearing it in public and not feel weird I walk by my nmom just now and guess what  Shes wearing a shirt from the same franchise as one of my shirts  She usually just wears other stuff not relating to this particular thing  She saw my shirt  got jealous and bought a similar shirt to spite me   Generally she pretends to be too cool or mature to wear stuff like this Part of me just wants to burn my shirts now  but moreso I just want to not visual see her ever again  Unfortunately that wish wont be granted  In that case  I just have to remind myself that what shes doing has nothing to do with me  I can still like my shirts even though shes doing whatever shes doing,961,181
1740,p6w9s9,0,2,Am I wrong for calling out my father on his behaviour of me  Since Im his child and he raised me the  best  he could is it wrong if me to call him a bad father According to me he has always been financially abusive  He makes me feel guilty for every penny he spends on me to the point that I think about whatever I need a thousand times before I go ask him for it and even then Im scared shitless that he will not allow me to have it On top of that he holds everything he spends on me over my head    but indirectly  So to me he will say nothing  but he will go to my mom and say oh look I spend  on getting her a root canal for example  And when I say Im his responsibility and he has no right to guilt trip me about it  If he didnt want to spend money on his kids why have them in the first place    he gets all butt hurt saying he is doing the best he can Keep in mind he gets a good salary and is very well off  But he hates spending any of this money on us     of his salary goes into a bank account that only he has access to and this has been the way for as long as I know  And no it not being invested  its just sitting in the bank losing value every single day  I understand and believe in the concept of savings but what he does is  in my opinion  overboard And me calling him out puts me in a bad position with my family because according to them he does so much for us and Im still an ungrateful little b  ch towards him and I should be more grateful for all that he has done for us Umm    isnt that his responsibility  He made the choice of getting married and having kids  If he was not willing to spend any of his money on his family why bother having a family in the first place  Its not a necessity to have a family even if you dont want to  No gun was being held to his head to go and get married  It was a freaking choice of his   He made that choice  Now he should live up to it    in my opinion,1942,398

1745,p6vuox,0,7,Are my parents narcissistic  Hello everyone – My parents have always had moments where they were inconsiderate and disrespectful of me   But I came across the idea of narcissistic parents recently and am wondering if mine fit the bill   Some examples  When I was applying to college and considered going away to school  my mothers response was   Why do you need to go away to school anyway  You could just go to the community college and become a secretary  Thats good enough   I went back to school for two Masters degrees  and my mothers response during the second one was   Arent you tired of studying already   During my teen years  my dad reprimanded me for putting menstrual pads in the garbage where he could see them  He said   I knew about that well before you were even born  I dont need to see it in the garbage   He was an hour late to my high school graduation because  my mother didnt remind him   When I was dating in college  he gave me the white wedding dress speech   When you were born  all I ever wanted was to one day walk you down the aisle in a white wedding dress and know that you deserved to be in it  However  now as an adult  I feel they continue to cross boundaries that my husband and I agree are inappropriate for grown adults with their own home  They knew the code to our garage door  so theyd come in with no warning or advance notice  Sometimes  theyd go into the backyard and look in the back patio door because we have no curtain or blinds on it  It would annoy my husband  but he was too respectful of them to say anything  and I always had the feeling that these are my parents and I should allow it  Now that I have my daughters  my mother continues to do and say things that clearly indicate she doesnt know her place  When I went over to my parents house one time for a family get together  my mother got mad that I went into another room to pump  She said   Why do you have to do that now  We have guests   Due to past history  I also have little reason to trust her   At six months old  she dropped my daughter on her head on a tile floor after she dismissed my concerns that she was not secure enough   For a while  she was adamant about wanting my daughter to sleep over  When my mother saw that I wasn’t comfortable with it  shed turn to my daughter and say   You want to sleep over grandmas  dont you   In the past year and a half  I feel like its gotten worse   In the fall  my father showed up outside my work and sat in his car  waiting to see if I showed up  I am a teacher  Do I need to mention the inappropriateness of a strange man sitting outside an elementary school without reason to be there  A month later  both he and my mother were sick  When I tried to get them both appointments to be vaccinated  my father got belligerent with me on the phone because  I didnt care about my family  and I didnt want to see them   By late spring  they were sick again  although we don’t know with what but they were laid out for  weeks  When they got better  it was almost Fathers Day and my mother tried to take over the day with no consideration for my husband  The last straw came a few weeks ago when she showed up at our door  again unannounced  no phone call  no advance notice  We were in the middle of eating breakfast  and we pretended we weren’t home   The following week  she brought it up on a video call in order to lay on the guilt trip  My husband and I both lost it  My mothers response was that she didnt feel like she should have to stand on ceremony  My father didnt even want to talk to us  She kept looking to the side  and I knew he was there but pretended like he wasnt  So now  my husband and I are fed up and wonder if its worth maintaining the relationship   Do they sound like narcissists   Theyve never been physically abusive  but the examples Ive cited make me wonder about where our relationship falls,3916,744

1748,p6vb03,0,4,Manipulation Brainwashing MentalAbuse Hi everyone Im very happy that I found this sub It feels good to know  that Im not alone with my experiences I want to tell you my story  I have to  because Im falling apart at the moment  I was raised by narcissists  Not the kind of them  that beats their kids  My parents are manipulative geniuses  My father is the type of narcissist that only does things for himself  He is neither empathic nor understanding  He blamed me for everything since I am able to think  He was never there for me  Always promising stuff to me and when I was so happy to finally do stuff with my dad  he just shit on me and did other stuff that was more important for him than his only child The worst thing about it is  that he always made me believe  that hes the greatest and that I am the lazy  aggressive kid who never does what his father tells it to do He sucked out my self esteem  my confidence  everything  He insulted me  I never knew  when he would freak out next He punished me by taking the only thing  that really took me away from that horrible reality  My PC After an argument he stopped talking to me  he completely ignored me  And suddenly  after a few days  everything was like it was before I never understood  why he acted like that My Mom was the exact opposite  but also with extremely narcissistics traits  She loved blaming me when I did stupid shit  she was shittalking about me with her friends  she was always so shocked  when I did something  that didnt fit her imagination of the perfect child On the other hand  she still gave me a lot of love  Thats the only reason  I am still alive today My mom was traumatized by the death of her sister  who died from heroin abuse Her worst fear was that I get addicted to something  She always told me  that I already was addicted and how bad gaming is for me  She was so toxic when she had the feeling to be a bad mother They did blame me for almost everything  my dad bullied me  my mum overcared and put me under massive pressure  My IQ is  and she always expected that I will do all the stuff that she wants  She thought  she could improve my  genius  I hated it  I had to do so much stuff that I didnt want to do  I was forced to do it anyway  I was blamed when I didnt want to  They didnt care about my feelings  blamed me EXTREMELY for my anger  Laughed about me when I was scared about something  And the worst thing about it is here to come They are manipulative as fuck  They always showed themself as the good parents and gave me the feeling  I was a bad kid and a failure  They brainwashed me  And it worked Now  Im taking medication against my depression and anxiety daily  I developed a pot addiction and it feels like my parents are now in my head  constantly telling me that Im doing everything wrong and that Im not worth shit I was able to move out and since december  Im living alone  Im broken inside  My heart feels like it has shattered Im in therapy for  years now and I did a lot of progress  But theres still this incredible emptiness inside of me  Im so done of it I will move on  because I promised it to my grandma  But its so hard  Every day is so incredibly hard  Im struggling with eating and sleeping  My body feels horrible  My stomach hurts all the time  Its just to much too carry Maybe you guys can show me  how you are healing your inner wounds  I would appreciate so much Love to all of you  your worth is infinite ❤️❤️❤️,3514,640
1749,p6v9zr,0,2,Chaos makes me feel safe One way I heal is by mediating and trying to find subconscious thoughts  While doing this I had an important realization of why I always need to be  on  or entertained or in some kind of adrenaline rush  And that is is my mom was very neglectful and not just emotionally  I guesse when I was young being left alone almost all the time I felt like i was abandoned and scared and like i was gonna die even  But then my parents would always fight and scream and be violent in the other room and hearing that chaotic presence made me feel safe bwcuse then I knew I wasnt abandoned and that was as close to feeling safe as I was gonna get in this household  All those danger or overstimulated feelings I got in my body when they were being violent and fighting each other I learned to associate with safety becuse they made no effort to actually make me feel safe  So I had to look for some version  of good feelings  in the bad painful feelings  Since hearing people screaming and knowing Im not abandoned is alittle better than being neglected and thinking Ive been abandoned    that was my postive feelings my only version of safety  So I gusse i seek out chaos or being overstimulated because that is what makes me feel safe that is what I thought safe was  That why I get boared so easily and always need to be on   just like most people want to feel safe almost all the time I need to be  on  almost all the time,1441,273

1751,p6v1su,0,4,Almost there… I  f  am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel  My “mother” has been in assisted living since the end of June  My husband and I moved her to our state  years ago because she was declining and had discarded my siblings one too many times  she’s burned bridges and never had to pay the price for it  There was always someone there to clean up her debris  We thought she would be here  at most  a year  We found an apartment for her one mile from our home  Five years later  she’s finally off of my back and someone else responsibility  In the five years that she’s been here  I’ve had countless panic attacks and one mental breakdown  I’m currently in therapy  My husband had no idea what my childhood was like  I kept that hidden  I’m realizing that the shame I felt  that kept me silent all those years was theirs and never mine  until one day  years ago  she had a toxic meltdown on him  I was not there   and when he told me about it  something snapped in me  and I told him  over a period of months  what my childhood was like  He was horrified  He believed me from the start  Since that day  he has been my shield and a fantastic buffer from her  He took most of the responsibility for her care and helped me shoulder the rest  He is the reason that I am functional  Since she’s been in the facility  I feel like I can finally breathe  No more taking her to countless doctor appointment  no more cleaning her apartment  no more picking up her meds  no more keeping track of her meds  no more getting her groceries  no more calling her every night  no more listening to her complain  no more being told what I have to do for her  and most importantly  NO MORE HER  The only thing I will do is visit her once per week for an hour and only with my husband present  I’ve wanted my life back for the past five years  I’ve been in stasis for each of those years  I have not been free to live my own life  I have resented each moment that she’s been here  I have had to do things for her that were never done for me  I did not get taken to the doctor  yet I had to take her on a whim  She did laundry once a month  ask me if I had  pairs of underwear  I did not    yet she would make sure that I had her laundry done and done to her specifications  I had to take her to get her hair done   When I needed a haircut  I was told  “No  nobody’s looking you anyway “  I had to help her figure out her insurance  When I needed help with picking classes in high school  she told me not to bother her with that shit  I could list countless examples  but I know that you know  why else would you be here  For the first time in five years  my husband  son  and I were able to take a family vacation together  Since she’s been here  someone would always have to stay behind to look after her  Not any more  She is miserable in the facility  she makes sure to tell me as soon as I arrive  I have encouraged her to join in the MULTIPLE activities the facility provides  but she refuses  She would rather guilt me for her loneliness than take part in any social program to lighten her mood  She will choose misery until the day she dies  She must love it  She’s welcome to it  She can sit in her room and be miserable  That was acceptable to her for me while I lived in that house  at least I’ll check in on her once a week  I’m almost at the finish line  she will never leave the facility  I am no longer obligated to care for her in any way  my husband knows my past  and I’m in therapy  I’m not sure why I decided to post  maybe I’m feeling safer now that there is no way that she can reach me  When the phone rings  I don’t get a spike in my anxiety anymore  it will never be her on the other end tasking me with the latest Labor of Hercules  She is contained in the facility  and I am so relieved  She could have been a queen  she has  children   in laws   grandchildren  and  great grandchildren  If she had been any kind of a mother  we would all have been vying to see who could take her in   We are all good  kind people  She should be so proud of us all  Instead  she has discarded my siblings numerous times over the most petty garbage  And so she sits in her room at the facility alone and miserable  and I just feel relief,4255,841
1752,p6uz9z,0,3,Struggling to come to terms So first time posting  I have been lurking on Reddit for awhile  I had a massive clash with my mother recently that has alot of fallout  I was explaining to a friend how my childhood was with my mother and he told me to come here and just read some of the posts and its been   rough  I feel like maybe my mother is a narcissist but I also feel like my childhood wasnt bad I have a very vivid memory of when I was   Im F now  and her screaming at me saying if I dont like how she does things to leave  Well I did  And she was pissed when I finally got back home  Other things were her waking me up at insane hours because I didnt do something her way  screaming at me for defending myself and saying I am just being combative  forcing me into confrontations that made me panic  on one occasion she told a person I had a crush on them while I was there and then getting upset when I didnt like that  There is just alot from my childhood that I thought was normal that wasnt apparently The most recent thing actually cost me a job  She and my dad are talking about splitting up  My dad thought he could fix things and my mom  without talking to him  has already been looking for new places and was talking to another guy  The guy ended up being one of those Nigeria catfishing scams  Since then  she has pulled out of allowing my husband to borrow a car since I needed my car for work and just dropped watching my kids  I ended up having to quit my job so my husband can get to work  his job pays better   We relied and trusted her and she just dumped us while we are trying to get back on our feet  I would go on about how she has treated my sister but thats a whole different rant  Long story short  my mom is homophobic towards my very gay sister  I hate it Im just struggling to understand what I did wrong for my mom to treat me like this  Even now as an adult I feel like I just disappoint her  Im hoping that posting this out here I can get some answers or maybe others who understand  Im not sure if my mom is a narcissist  I know I wasnt the best kid to raise but I cant help but relate to alot of what I have been reading here  What do I do with just processing this or even how to go forward with setting boundaries,2277,448

1755,p6up33,0,7,Therapist validated my feelings about nmom Ive been a lurker on and off for the past few years but Ive finally had some progress with my nmom and wanted to share  This subreddit really helped me recognize my moms actions for what they were even though I did second guess and doubt what I was feeling  It feels amazing to have something that has been a weight on me for years at this point lifted  even if its just a little bit and Im still working through this As background I joined this subreddit on a different account about  years ago and eventually convinced myself that my moms behavior wasnt that bad despite the fact that a lot of it still affects how I feel about myself   years  after moving out her house and going pretty low contact with her  I still feel comfortable with the boundary of talking to her occasionally  I have nephew that lives in her house that I still want to support  She has a history of commenting negatively on my appearance unprovoked  a lack of boundaries  outright screaming  parentification  treating us as adults rather than children  and prioritizing herself over the needs of me and my sister  i e  Needing a computer for school and buying herself a new TV instead  redecorating the house instead of paying my tuition in high school and college  Shes recently gained the habit of calling me pretty consistently  When I dont answer for a couple of her calls  shell start with   Ive been calling you  Why dont you answer me  You need to tell me things    before even saying hello and its been putting me in a bad place  Im a person in my mid twenties with a full time job  a new house  and friendships that Im trying to maintain  Im just busy and dont have the time to pretend that I like my mom Needless to say  weve never had an amazing relationship so  it was weird to me that she wanted to be my friend all of sudden despite the fact that shes used the line Im not your friend multiple times with me  I decided to bring it up with a therapist Ive been seeing recently  After talking through it with she said   Have you ever looked up narcissim in mothers    Holy shit   I had never mentioned me being in this subreddit before and after talking about my mom for a single session she came up with this At this point  I had everything validated and gathered the courage to tell my mom that I was officially putting up a low contact boundary the next time she called  Her response really showed me that she doesnt even think of her behavior as borderline abusive which is discouraging and makes me feel like Ill never really get closure for how my childhood played out but I guess thats a journey to work through in the future,2706,482

1757,p6ulij,0,10,We need to start holding the Enablers accountable Ive seen a lot of posts on this sub that will mention how their Enabler Parent was their rock  kept the abuse from getting worse or use their relationship with their EParent as rationale for why they cant go LC or NC with their Narc Parent  While I understand trauma bonding and why with parents  you cling to one if the other is abusive  but I really dont think people  in general  are holding Enablers accountable for their part is narcissistic abuse Once I was well into mental health treatment and had actually confronted the abuse I received from my NMom  thats when my therapist started talking about my Dad more and more  Where was he when these things happened  How did he react when I went to him about what my mom was doing  Did he ever challenge my mom whenever she was hurling emotional abuse at her children  How did he handle the situation when my mother was still active in her alcoholism In the beginning of when we were examining my fathers role in all of this  I defended him a lot  Saying I was a Daddys girl and that he kept her behavior in check  But as I really began to look at the whole picture  it really clicked with me with what the word  enabler  really means  That my NMom was empowered in her abuse of her children and her alcoholism because she had a partner that enabled her behavior  A partner who picked up her slack where she failed as a parent  but never helped his children cope with her behavior and left those kids in that situation  How my EDad spent all of his energy  taking care  of my mother in a way that allowed her alcoholism to thrive and prevented her from having to deal with the consequences of her actions  He infantilized her  helped keep her sick in her alcoholism  and he failed us when it came to her behavior We are as a culture becoming more and more aware of narcissism and narcissistic abuse  we are seeing terms like gaslighting  grey rocking and setting boundaries more and more all over the place  But I dont see anyone  other than our patron saint  Dr  Ramani  really talking about enabling and its role in emotional abuse  And working through that dynamic  especially when it involves trauma bonding  is painful  but I believe crucial part of healing the damage caused by narc abuse  Your enabler parent may have been in the trenches with you as the bombs were falling  but they  at minimum  left you both there in the mud and at worst kept you from climbing out,2494,450

1761,p6u4ln,0,4,Imposter syndrome caused by narcissistic parenting Does anyone else get this Sometimes I feel like I don’t belong in groups or I suddenly start feeling things like “I shouldn’t be here  I don’t fit with these people”  when I actually do It’s difficult to explain  but it’s like an imposter syndrome caused by a lack of confidence  an “expectation” of rejection by others linked to a social anxiety because of an avoidant attachment style  and also probably internalising narc criticism which has made me feel like I don’t deserve my achievements and that any time something has gone well in my life it has been a “fluke”  and not a result of genuine hard work or something I deserve  I suppose it can be traced back to a poor and inaccurate self image  but I am worried it’s really impacting my ability to make genuine connections with other people Of course  like all victims of a narc  I also crave that feeling of belonging to a group  but it seems to get spoilt or overridden by a fear of rejection,1011,175

1768,p6teuk,0,8,My friend’s abusive parents have been stalking them non stop and I need help keeping them safe  Cross post from r rbnlegaladvice Okay  so this may be a bit long  but I’m going to try summing or up as much as possible  The folks at r legaladvice were very disrespectful and don’t quite understand narcissistic abuse  so I had to go elsewhere for any type of constructive help   Backstory     TW  Abuse  As the title states  my friends abusive parents have been trying to track them down and make them return home ever since they ran away a few months  maybe even a year or two  ago  Mind you  this is a grown person we’re talking about  they’re  going on   The parents have been using the excuse that the child is sick and needs to be at home so they can take care of them  The child is fine  only suffering from mental trauma from all of the emotional abuse  The police in the state that the parents reside have stopped helping them  as they say the parents have been wasting their time filing reports on a child who clearly isn’t missing  just done with their BS  so they came to the state in which my friend ran to  and have gotten the police involved here We live in a safe house for runaway youth  and the parents found out their kid was living here  By rule were not allowed to tell parents that their kid is here  but they brought the police with them so we had to comply with a “wellness check ” The parents then proceeded to go around to some of the stores my friend and I frequent giving out their card and telling them to contact their number the next time the kid comes in the store  My friend is currently in the hospital due to ptsd  and because the police were involved  the parents were able to find out they were there and showed up at the hospital  Now my friend is terrified of being discharged out of fear that they’re waiting outside for them   What we’re doing   We’re currently looking for legal action to be taken against the parents  but a Civil Protective Order and Anti Stalking Order both require my friend to show up in court  which they say will be too traumatic for them and they’re not sure if they want to go through with They are  however  planning to go in person to the police department and asking them to stop helping the parents because they are indeed not missing  and they are just running away from their abuse We’ve been looking for ways to possibly get the parents arrested make them lose their jobs  but the only thing we found is that the parents can get jail time for making false reports and wasting the police’s time  We don’t know the specifics  but this seems like our only solid option right about now  My friend does have some evidence of the abuse  but not the most extreme of it  and the legal system kinda sucks when it comes to emotional abuse anyways  so we’re not sure if that would be enough  I guess what I’m here to ask is  what can we do other than a protective order to make sure some legal repercussions are taken against the parents  Have any of you taken legal action against your n’parents  What did you do  and what was the outcome  How can we permanently stop the parents from being able to harass my friend like this  constantly tracking them down  lying about them being mentally unable to take care of themself  etc  Also  my friend wants to know if there’s a way they can get their missing persons report removed from the internet  I haven’t found a way to do that  but they’re very unsettled by the fact that it’s there  and they want it gone I apologize for such a long post  but I do thank you all so much in advance for any help you could offer at all  I greatly appreciate it,3684,669

1773,p6srop,0,5,My mother has ruined just about every aspect of my life and I dont know what to do about it I    have played a sport for  years now  and during the past  years of that sport Ive gotten really good and made a national team  Practice is my escape  and I really did enjoy the sport for most of the time Ive played  Last season  my stats were out of this world  I was among the best performers  if not  the best  on my team  And I really worked for it  I spent up to six hours working out every day during quarantine and it really showed up in my game  But during that time  Id been staying with relatives  and once I moved back home  everything took a turn for the worst  Just for context  I slept on the couch at my house  and so did she because we lived with relatives  She refused to get us our own apartment because it was a  waste of money   And eventually  I realized no matter how much I tried to get through to my mom  she would not care  But I refused to stop trying  And thats when it came back to bite me in the butt  This past summer season  my performance on my team has improved immensely defensively  but while I used to be among the best offensive players  I dropped to sitting the bench during big games  My mom saw this and grew extremely angry about it  and in an emotional outburst told my coach I was no longer doing workouts at home and I had stop putting in the effort to improve my performance  She then went on to make an insane contract that I had to complete within about two and a half weeks of I wanted to stay on the team  Write an essay about accountability  write about three people in leadership  start a gratitude journal  and the most absurd request of all  lose  pounds in two weeks  This contract sent me into a complete spiral and while I was en route to get recruited for college sports  I was seriously considering just quitting  Somehow I got lucky and before the two weeks ended my mom told me both her best friend and boyfriend basically went  what the hell are you doing   when she told them about it  And though she apologized to me  I do feel it was because they told her it was wrong and not because she cared about how I felt  The week prior wed gotten into an argument and she said  I dont care about your struggles  get over them  This past week  I attempted to set things right with my coach  who although I was one of his best performers until my mental health decline  said he completely agreed with my mom and was trying to convince me to leave the team  Though I was able to convince him to let me keep my spot  if I dont perform well this fall  Im kicked off definitively  And during the entire conversation I tried to tell him my mom didnt tell him the full truth  and that I even had VIDEO PROOF of all my workouts  which my grandpa would take me to bcs my mom always had work   he didnt believe me  Straight up told me  If youre putting the effort in  why did your mom tell me otherwise   And he insisted I was only upset because now I was about to lose my spot on the team  And thats when I realized my mom has completely ruined this for me  My reputation with my coach is completely ruined  My mom said its either I play with this team or quit  and I do not see myself continuing with them past this fall  We just got a house finally  and now live two hours away one way from them  It would make more sense to find a new team  but its not even a choice I have  and I feel the environment on this team isnt healthy for me to be in anymore  I still want to play in college  but what do I do  Should I convince my mom to let me play for another team  I feel very lost in the situation  but I dont think I should give up just yet,3721,729

part of Europe  For a while  I thought I was doing quite well in terms of  living  and  adulting    handled and completed higher degrees  found jobs  got through several moves across and between countries  handled getting married and divorced and still done kinda okay  For a while now  at least a couple of years  I havent felt like I am doing too great     I thought that by setting goals to advance beyond my starting baseline would help me feel better about myself  feel pride in my achievements and make life feel like its worth living  But I havent felt that in ages  If anything  most aspects of my life look horrid from where I am standing and even though I have advanced from my starting baseline  I am still pretty much     losing at the game called life I once had a passion   my work and education  Ive lost that about  years after I got my PhD in a field I was truly passionate about  I am lucky to have had a job ever since I finished my PhD  but now the energy that kept me going in face of academic and office politics  energy which stemmed from curiosity and desire to find out new things and also teach people  has dissappeared  If anything I think its all a sham and even within this  masquarade  I am not good  intelligent  knowleadgeable enough  nor do i feel like I have a voice  I do not feel like I can make good service to the values that once drove my energy for my work and I no longer believe in it   Also I do not have great relationships with my co workers  I always thought that by being nice and smiling  saying good things to people  would win me kudos  But actually  perhaps I just come across as aloof and strange to my colleagus in each of my jobs that Ive held in the past  years  many  many short term contracts    I have no idea if people generally dislike me  feel indifferent to me etc    the only advice I keep getting is that I shouldnt care but    I also cannot live in a bubble not knowing whether I offend people or push them away unwillingly  And maybe I dont but I still fail terribly at making any meaningful connections I thought that by diversifiying my social networks Id feel more enriched by peoples stories  experiences and would provide both a source of potential friendships and new  diverse activities  But after multiple tries  I gave up searching and trying    I only have my partners friends to rely on  which I do regard as primarily his    I havent kept proper contact with my old friends  due to having to focus a lot on work for me to still have a job  when I still believed in it   and I dont think they actually ever liked me or were ever more than indifferent to my existence  I tried rekindling old relationships frequently  but   I only speak to people if I initiate    And then I get forgotten   Also  so much time has passed that Ive lost touch with peoples lifes and them with mine  So interactions are simply polite and out of politeness  when anyone has a bit of a free pocket of time to fill it  i e  I would not have the courage to ask any of my friends to actively help with a house move or anything too onerous because that sort of closeness has never been there and it is less so nowadays   I cherish the times I do see them  but they are very few and I do tend to not be great at having a voice during get togethers  My family life is not great either  I take comfort and I am grateful for my fiances family for accepting me  I have  family members close by   my mother doesnt really like me and I have felt rather comfortable on the Nparents threads on reddit  I am still trying to please her to feel accepted and despite that plus LC  things are not getting better so I am working actively on helping myself accept the bad situation for what it is  I also try to continuously see her point of view so that if I am criticised or yelled at  I feel better equipped to forgive those situations  My only other family member who I cherish highly is understandibly too busy with their own family and worries  hence too tired for connection  I havent seen this person in at least months and last time we spoke on a videochat was around March  Again  just like with the friends situation   we kinda lost touch with each others lifes  And frankly  I think they are too tired  busy and have enough of their own stuff to deal with than to listed to me whine I havent enjoyed many things in many months  but I am constantly trying to  do better  and drag myself towards some goal  I continue to take medication for anx and depression  I have  therapists  one for past trauma and one for potential  self diagnosed ASD   Drink alcohol socially once  max twice a week  without going overboard  given it could screw up my mood even more    I have put on a lot of weight so I am trying to calorie count and get myself back into an exercise routine  But it all feels bleak  Ill do it  expend my entire energy spoons for a day and then just want to go to bed at  and be on my own  If I could just not have to get out of bed at all and speak to no one at all that would be great    but also sad  I am a bit lucky that I am currently on holiday   so waking up later than   and trying to  allow myself   give myself permission to hide under the duvet in bed is okay  But once  go back to work   I wonder if i will still have any spoons for the new exercise routine and calorie count Where is my energy and will to  live   My motivation for anything at all  I know I should be doing a host of things   but I dont want to   too difficult  and for what  As I wont feel happy about any of these efforts anyway and reaching goals wont make me happier  as my history has taught me And I feel ashamed of it all  What a spiral of  meh  I feel lucky to have a partner who loves and cherishes me and who still wants to marry me  It feels like the sole comfort I currently have in what seems otherwise like a void life  I cannot really see a happy or at least content future  with my having kids  a nice house etc  I feel like these outcomes are highly unlikely  I hate the thought that the way I feel right now might drive him away too  which would leave me utterly alone  as I have been before  And I would lose even the last good thing that is going for me    But I am almost willing to accept that too  Id rather he were happy than miserable like myself Sorry for the long post  but I am not sure tbh what my problem is or even where to start to make it better  But I do want to do better   surely  not everyone feels like this  Where to I start  Does anyone have any good advice for me  In short  All aspects of my life feel bleak and void despite efforts  I dont know why my life feels so broken and I dont know how to fix the parts that are indeed broken  I have  good thing going for me and I fear that my current mood  low energy and lack of motivation will drive this  good thing away also  In dire need of advice  Or maybe its me having stupid first world problems,7171,1371

1790,p6q211,0,5,My mom discourages me to go to a college This is a brief story of my high school days   I have a older sister  When she was in high school  she was also discouraged to go to an university because  as my mom had said  universities are expensive  However  she went anyway  while she worked part time so hard to make money for a living and tuition   And when I was in high school  I also thought that I wanted to go to an university because without a degree its more difficult to get a job or does help somehow when youd change your career  But my mom used guilt trip to tell me indirectly  in a manipulative way  not to  i e   If you went to a college  Id have a hard time again as I did when your sister did that  How on earth could parents discourage their children about education  while that is the responsibility for them  She always put herself emotionally and physically before anyone  And she always told me your dad is a damn guy  even though he is an engineer  My dad stayed in silence all the time cuz he knew whatever statement he made wouldnt work for my mom  since she always scream and shout to stop anyone in my family from speaking  when shes at a disadvantage  And now Im unemployed  facing and being under pressure from society that says unless youve got a degree youd be not even on a resume scanning Parents are evil and society treat them like  You did a good job  You gave a birth and made a contribution to society  When they grow up  youd done with your job   How could they behave like that  Who allowed her to be a parent of human beings,1580,299

1792,p6pvag,0,9,F  I’m afraid to have kids because of how I was raised by my NMom   CW  mentions of bodily harm  Hi all  I’ll try to keep this relatively concise  The gist is I got engaged in March  just before all the lockdowns went into place in the US  My fiancé is a very sweet and loving man and we get along great  even though the past year has been really tough on both of us emotionally and mentally He wants to have kids despite having a similar relationship with his mom as I do  I have met his mom multiple times and she was definitely in a mostly loveless marriage with his father and appeared to latch onto my fiancé for companionship  like some parents do  though it’s inappropriate to rely on your kids like that  He set the record straight with her and they appear to be somewhat better now  But I can’t say the same thing for my mom  She has no filter and basically assumes she can get her way with pretty much everything  regardless of who she hurts in the process  She actually “thanked” my fiancé for going out with me on a Zoom call  like I’m some kind of freak  when we didn’t attend Thanksgiving  at her house due to COVID though she still had my brother and his wife over  My brother later got COVID from that incident but has since recovered My mom has been extremely critical  controlling and borderline bullying for my entire life since I was growing up and constantly trying to meddle in my love life with unsolicited advice  I know she does this because she is a profoundly insecure person who hated her dad growing up for choosing work over his family but she lacks the self awareness to not use her children like therapists or recognize how her actions alienate people  She at one point told two strangers waiting for a plane at the airport that she hates my tattoos and “wishes she could cut them off and replace them with skin grafts” because she finds them trashy  Two random strangers  waiting for a plane  I was  at the time  And she thinks that makes her more relatable I’m not against having kids  even though I do like the way things are now with him  but my previous experiences with her left such a traumatic impact on me that I doubt I have the emotional and mental health resiliency to not go down the same path that she did  I’ve had major depression bouts since I was   insomnia  eating disorders  weight issues  self worth issues and been in  abusive relationships with narcissistic men  I held off on dating for  years and got therapy to try to get over my resentment and anger  Now she is trying to interfere with my wedding planning despite the boundaries I’ve put into place  If she keeps it up  I won’t invite her there period  The general question I have is  are there any other people on here who weren’t sure about having kids based on how you were raised  Did you end up having them or not and how did it affect your life going forward I’m at an emotional rut because I don’t want to lose him as I love him so but I feel paralyzed by what to do,3012,559

1799,p6p396,0,23,My NMom has conditioned my adopted cat to think she’s her mom instead of me  Now my cat is her cat  I adopted my cat April   My childhood dog  who was like a daughter to me  super attached to me  was put down in October   First of all  for needed context   my mother would overfeed my dog her medication  in hopes of “curing” her or treating her better  She confessed this to me in tears after my dog died  She worried it contributed to her needing to be put down  She hid my dog’s medicine from me when i wanted to do research to see what natural ways I can help alleviate her pain  like CBD oil etc   Just to help in any way  She vehemently denied me even knowing what the medicine was called  Furthermore  when my dog was literally dying after injection  she weakly turned her head towards me  and my mother forced her head to turn towards her instead  saying “look at  me   my baby”… as if she didn’t let my dog go RAIL THIN when I away for a month  So my mother was the last thing my dog saw  Not both of us  or even me  Just my mom  I was a complete mess after that  And I still don’t forgive my mom for what she did For a few months  I couldn’t stand sleeping alone without my dog  I was the only one in my house who slept alone  My parents had each other  my sister had her chihuahua  I had nothing but an empty bedside where my dog would sleep every single night  So I decided to adopt a different species  since I didn’t want to feel like I was replacing my dog  and I just wanted a new baby to care for and cuddle with at night So I got my cat  and named her Astra  My mom would curse and yell about “getting rid of that cat” when she was too shy to come out from under my bed the first few months  My mom gave up on her so easily  It was emotionally hard for me  but I didn’t  After my cat finally came out  amp  started warming up to me familiarizing herself  my mom forced my cat out of my room and into hers  saying she wasn’t allowed in my room  I made my cat a custom litterbox that looks like a pot of flowers  I bought her litter  the best cat food  etc  Yet she was close to my mom  And still is  more so  Because she’s been conditioned to be by her side  not me  And I still sleep alone  And I’m angry  I’m so angry  I’ve confronted my mom about this one time  and just as expected  she denies it with yelling and cursing  then asks “what’s wrong with you”  etc  My mom has even told me to stop feeding my cat  because it’s her job now  My heart is beyond the realm of broken  I miss my dog  And Astra was supposed to be my new baby  Yet now she treats me almost like a stranger  and meows when my mom is gone  sitting outside her room  It hurts  A lot  She won’t come into my room  or stay very long  It’s not familiar anymore I have given up  No matter what I’m her legal owner and she’s still my baby  but emotionally it doesn’t feel like it  And I think when I move out I will leave her with my mom  It’s just that Astra was my special name for her… it means “from the stars ” When I adopted her at a rescue site  her name was Naleli… which means star  I thought that was an insane coincidence  that it was meant to be  Hell  when I looked at her documents  she was literally rescued on my BIRTHDAY two years prior  at just  month old  I guess I was wrong  I’m just sad My mom has ruined so much for me in my life  She has shit in my dreams  stolen money from me  called me a whore at  just because I developed early  made me feel utterly worthless  My list makes a cvs receipt look like a post it  But all of that pales in comparison to this  I’m upset  I’m just really upset… thats all,3640,721

1807,p6o9zc,0,4,My n parents force me into doing things I dont want by leaving me no other choice They twist my arm until I give in  This has happened multiple time They did that with my higher education  They said we will provide everything and pay for everything as long as you study while staying at home  I ended up studying business instead of psychology which i had been my dream  The only college near our home provided business as an option or engineering  Then when I wanted to marry a guy they wouldnt allow me to marry him and in my culture thats considered bad so my I couldnt marry the guy I liked  We stayed together for  years but my parents didnt talk to me for  years  We  recently broke up and my mom has started to take to me again a little Now since Im  and they expect me to get married so they treat me like shit and dont respect my boundaries to the point that I broke down and am agreeing to marry a guy of their choosing  They are forcing me to marry a cheap guy and I absolutely refuse to do that  My own father has been a stingy person my whole life and Im never living through that for the rest of my life  And so they have stopped talking to me again I know they will do the same with kids  I have never wanted kids  I know myself and they keep saying once you get married you will realise how important kids are  Im afraid what they have in store for me next Due to various factors I cannot go NC with them  Because of the place i live in its impossible for me to just run away and start a life of my own on my own terms  Im doing the best i can with what resources i have but god these people are absolute monsters and living with them is hell,1684,331
1808,p6o7ha,0,5,Narc mum keeps pulling the classic  You know Im right  My mums annoyed at me for getting a job  Yeah  you read that right  She has accused me of leaving my son out and not thinking about my partner  saying my partner works harder than me and that I should really be a stay home mum Because she has never worked in her life and managed to flout the benefits welfare system  she has this very distorted view on what family life is  and just life in general tbh  She doesnt realise that every family is different and that not everyone is able to cheat the system and live off benefits  Theres lots of families with both parents working  but where she has no friends or family  she doesnt know how the real world works and that its very much normal  Shes a very sheltered person  I feel kinda sorry for her in a weird way She has been trying to pit my partner against me  telling him  I dont like what shes doing to you and your son   going on like she knows our lives and agreements  sucking up to him and saying he works really hard etc   She has managed to twist things and made out Im the bad person for getting upset at her for making a nasty comment about me working the other day  My partner is now mad at ME  accusing me of causing him stress and being dramatic about the entire situation  I called her this morning to try and talk and explain things  She literally starts off saying  You know Im right  and when I tried to explain that if she was concerned about my partner and our working lives  she couldve just spoke to him instead of making an embarrassment of herself and making me upset and angry  SHE had the audacity to start crying over the phone and cut the call  For reference  she posted the vile comment on a Facebook photo I posted of me working at a community day thing  I had people reply  message me and what not saying she was bang out of order and asking if i was ok and were extremely shocked to see that it was my mum who made the horrific comment  Shes done this before to my cousins  made vile comments about their parenting and own lives  thinking she knows best and what not  This is why she has no one  Not even her brother and sisters want anything to do with her  because she thinks shes superior but deep down  shes really really insecure so she projects it onto others  especially if they are happy or have some sort of success good news She always thinks shes right  She assumes when people get upset or angry its because they acknowledge that shes right  when reality is  people get annoyed with her because her behaviour is totally immature and unnecessary  She has pushed almost everyone away because of her constant  Im always right  attitude  She doesnt get invited to family meals or coffee meets or a trip to the pub  When my uncle died  who was married to my mums sister   the first thing my aunt did was call me and came round because she wanted support but knew she wouldnt get any from my mum  My mum never had friends and growing up we had to constantly keep moving because she kept causing trouble with the neighbours  Yet she doesnt see herself as the problem  but everyone else  Shell never realise it In her eyes shell always be right  Yet  shes a very bitter  entitled  lonely person whos hitting her fifties and has never had any kind of success  I know it makes her insecure  seeing family around her being successful  having friends  jobs  getting married and engaged  getting mortgages etc  She tries and hide her insecurities by lashing out at others for literally no reason  I honestly dont know how she can look at herself and think what shes doing is perfectly normal  Its not normal to always think youre right  criticise others yet get upset when people do the same to you and think the world revolves around you  Im kinda rambling now at this point  I just wanted to get shit off my chest Has anyone had any similar experiences  I know I have all the love and support in the world  but shit still hurts because my parents just cannot ever be proud of me,4073,740

1812,p6nv6i,0,21,Being the Golden Child isn’t better than the Scapegoat  Here’s why Have you ben led to believe that being the Golden Child is a better thing than being the Scapegoat  And that your Golden Child siblings got a better treatment  than you the Scapegoat  The narcissistic parent has fooled you  This isn’t true  The narcissistic parents have made it look like that to you just to make you feel like you did something wrong  But just because it looks like that  doesn’t mean it’s true  The Golden Child doesn’t have it better and here’s why   The Golden Child never see through the abuse of the narc parents  The Scapegoat does Partly the reason why you’re the Scapegoat is because you saw through the bullshit of your narcissistic parents and actually have the guts to stand up to them  Some Golden Childs will never see this  I have an Golden Child sister and she always advocates for ny narc parents their abuse and will always tolerate it  no matter what  Being the Golden Child is sad  because they lack the self respect to stand up for themselves   The Golden Child never breaks free from the narcissist  The Scapegoat do This is because of the reason i mentioned above  The Golden Child doesn’t have the guts to stand up to the narcissistic parents  let alone break free and go no contact  But the Scapegoat will  because of the reason that they stop tolerating the abuse   The Golden Child doesn’t have an identity of their own  The Scapegoat do The reason why you’re the Scapegoat isn’t because you’re the problem  It’s because you actually have an identity and life outside the narcissist  and that is what they don’t like  But the Golden Child doesn’th have these things  And it’s sad  because my Golden Child sister is incapable of making her own decisions and incapable of having her own personal opinions as she’s so dependant and obiedent on my narcissistic mother and she will never fully grow up  It must be horrible to be the Golden Child   The Golden Child goes through abuse  just like the Scapegoat This is a thing we often forget  but always have to remember  The Golden Child got abused  too  Yes  in a different way  but abuse is abuse  no matter what  The Golden Child didn’t got less abuse as the Scapegoat  they’re as broken as us  just a different kind of broken  But broken  I witnessed it myself once  when my narcissisitic mother was on the phone with my Golden Child sister  i heard my narc mother being abusive to my GC sister   The Golden Child is incapable of building geniune relationships  But the Scapegoat do I see this often with my Golden Child sister as her relationships always fail or they’re not genuine  Because she always expects to be treated like a Queen  if people don’t treat her like that  she throws them in the trash  My GC sister would throw a temper tantrum if her friends forget it’s her birthday  and she will stop hanging out with them  untill they wish her Happy Birthday  It’s sad to see her living this life,2990,519
1813,p6nr6z,0,6,years and  fillings later First time poster  long time reader  Unsure how to go about this  really  but reading through so many of these has brought some interesting memories back up for me and I wanted to share one that still haunts me in the middle of the night  Also on mobile so apologies for that  Long story short  I moved  miles from home and never looked back  I’ve had to learn to do basic adult things on my own and one of the big ones was dental care  Finally  I had my own insurance and I got the nerve to go to the dentist  I am terrified of the dentist  Can’t explain it  super irrational detrimental fear of something so simple  But I make the appointment and go  Turns out  I have to get  fillings throughout my entire mouth  There’s even extra issue with wisdom teeth needing to be pulled  My mother and I speak occasionally  she calls to complain about my dad  I just relay new events that have happened in my life  and the subject of my dental care comes up  She’s surprised by the amount of work I need done but then she quickly forgets and rants about my dad instead  A few weeks go by before I get the call where she tells me she found the paperwork from the last time she had taken me to the dentist  It was a big deal because she had gotten dentures at the same time I had last been in  She started to brag to me that it had been  years since that last visit  “Can you believe it ” She actually bragged to me that it had been so long and how everything had turned out fine   years  I had to have two wisdom teeth removed because they came in crooked and were useless   fillings  and I have dental cleanings every  months because of periodontal disease  I don’t understand why she thought it was a feat of strength to never go to the doctor dentist when I was growing up,1820,350

1816,p6ndta,0,3,Should I go no contact with NP  First post here  I’m F and have lived outside of NP’s house for  years  I moved out as soon as I legally could  Basically  I started this routine of calling NP once per week to keep in touch whilst also maintaining boundaries  The routine started about  months ago now  Every time I come off the phone to her I feel like crap  I’m drained  tired  and upset  It’s like talking to my abuser every week  NP’s husband has anger problems and hurt me as a child  I hear him on the phone when I call her  She has always insisted that I call him ‘dad’  I’d love to go no contact  My problem is I have a young brother   y o   If I go no contact  I’ll surely never get to speak to him again  Then again  he’ll be  in four years  Do I hang around for that  or bail and hope he forgives me  Do you guys have any advice about what I should do  Or perhaps what you’ve done in a similar situation,928,182
1817,p6mmgz,0,6,Preferring to meet with only you  Is it part of the damaging things an N parent does to insist on spending time with you alone  An example  mine would not spend time with me and my partner and said would only meet with me individually   Compared to my other parent who wanted to spend some time with just me on a recent visit  but was very amiable to several meals with my partner there  Plus N parent hugs in such an odd way  Extends arm out and places open hand on the back of my neck  Then pulls me close   I think most people place their hand and attached arm on shoulders and upper back rather than neck  Also  it isnt so much a pull of the person towards you as a mutual moving towards each other   I call it a boa constrictor hug and have banned N parent from doing that specific thing  They do this silly laugh as though is so cute and hysterical but does respect my absolute refusal to engage in such a hug  Which is good for my sanity   By the way  I vary between minimal contact due to being busy  due to not liking N parent very much  and outright avoidance due to stuff they have said or done that so far misses the mark on the things I say will be meaningful to me that I feel irritated  Or we get into arguments cuz hold her to the same respectful communication standard I ask of everyone in my life  I moved far away and that helped a lot  Wanting my contact is a big motivator for gradually getting them to meet my needs in the ways I ask and not in whatever arbitrary ways they decide I ought to appreciate,1537,292

Saw my brother crying  after this incident When I was in st or nd grade  informed me that  I love you bc youre my child  but I dont  like  you    You dont ever forget that type of statement Went away to camp for a week or so one summer   Upon return  was informed   When you were away at camp  your siblings didnt miss you at all  by one parent  in the dark garage  just the two of us   Now  I knew

religious upbringing I was scared to steal from any store  so I stole from the lost and found at school   this was somehow acceptable to me   I developped  amp  executed an elaborate plot  amp  stole the shoes out of the lost  amp  found in the gym teachers office   The result was me ending up wearing ill fitting  worn out shoes some other kid had  lost   or cast off    I knew even whose shoes they were originally   whenever that kid would see me wearing the shoes  they would look at my feet  then give me the wierdest look   I think the kid knew I  stole  their shoes   BONUS  one of my parents  worked at the school    They saw me wearing the lost  amp  found shoes  shoes they didnt buy me  and said  nothing  Did not provide sufficient food  so I was underweight   Shamed me for what food I DID eat   Shamed me for my acne  blamed me for having acne   Said it was bc I  ate too much chocolate    I liked chocolate  sometimes bought myself a chocolate treat  they begrudged my liking chocolate  having a treat   Made fun  Blamed me liking chocolate for my normal teenage acne  expected my skin to be   clear all the time  or else it was my fault   Ridiculed me for seeking a dermatologists care to treat my pretty severe acne which WAS NOT caused by eating chocolate  but ultimately  hormones   Gaslighted me by first paying for my acne treatment drugs prescribed by dermatologist  w their insurance plan  then suddenly demanding I give them the money back  bc I owed them  or withholding reimbursement for said drugs Id paid for out of pocket when I was still a

my part time job money Shamed me for using toilet paper bc it costs money   They  shouldnt have to pay  for  my  toilet paper Accused me of theft for using hygiene products in the house   Using hygiene products stored in a bathroom cabinet was  stealing     You took all the xxxx   when I had taken just only what I needed and legitimately for hygiene purposes   If they saw I used any  that was  stealing  it Whenever something went missing in the house  assumed I had  stolen  it   Talked loudly  amp  repeatedly  about me being the thief culprit of having  stolen  the missing item  in my my siblings presence   Told me many times   youre a thief   if something got lost or went missing in the disorganized mess of a household Made me feel unwelcome in my own home to the point I got rid of most of my possessions so as not to take up any space    my room consisted of just a bed bedding  an empty shelf and maybe an empty desk or something   I had a small closet upon which I self installed a lock with key   I had the only key   They hated that  but for some reason  tolerated me keeping my small qty of stuff  mostly about  or  days clothes rotation  some books  and a few sentimental trinketts given me by relatives who genuinely loved me  but lived far away  in the locked closet  thus taking up little space and my presence in the home not being at all visible Did not do my laundry of the few clothes I did have  or did a slovenly job   Around age   I taught myself to do my own laundry by  watching the washing machine   opening the lid  amp  watching the dial at diff parts of the cycle to see how things worked  learning the laundry cycle   Thereafter I was able to appropriately launder my own clothes  actually  maybe that was a blessing as its a life skill  one I self taught to myself Did not assist me w homework or schooling beyond nd grade  then punished me for bringing home bad grades   Teachers tried to send notes home to find out what was going on  but I always hid the notes bc I feared wrath  amp  didnt understand what was in the notes  just that I would be punished for getting them Forced me into difficult  highly avoidable awkward situations

fast food joint   amp  forcing us to go in  amp  fill out job applications   None of which were ever replied to   When that failed  the next step was more serious    bringing us   amp  yr olds to the  Government employment office  to hunt for jobs on the job board there  this was well before internet was a thing    Place stank  was super depressing  and full of unnemployed adults  mostly immigrant

workforce    In retrospect  this ended up being a good thing to have done  but it came not from a place of wanting to do right by us  but rather of wanting us to become income earners at age  and

was outright disapproval of my continuing to like it  amp  want to do it   Finally parents  did  pull funding  amp  support  forcing me out  out of something I truly enjoyed  making fun of me all the while  amp  gloating at my disappointment   They always loved seeing me disappointed  amp  ashamed   I knew this  amp  wasnt surprised by their behaviour   They revelled in trying to convince me they took me out bc I was no good at the sport anyway   amp  was ridiculous I even wanted to try   I wasnt the best granted  but I had good skills in certain areas  amp  was working to better myself

1823,p6ln2l,0,4,Nparents kept me in such a controlling bubble that I never learned what   was until th grade  I was  when it happened so it’s understandable that they didn’t tell me then  but they didn’t even MENTION it as I got older  It was as if it never existed  I remember standing in a moment of silence every year before the pledge of allegiance in class on a certain day and not knowing what it was for  Ndad even bragged about me being “part of the last age group of children that didn’t know what   was” as if that was something to be proud of  And yet all of the kids in my class  who were my age  knew about it and many remembered it Keeping this information from me was also in the context of nparents keeping me heavily isolated from the outside world  They controlled who I could be friends with  every single thing that I ate  and everything I did  This was not a case of a child being happy and his parents not wanting to tell him about a terrorist attack to keep him safe  It was yet another way that they controlled the information that I had available to me Do any of you relate to this  Doesn’t have to be with    just the extreme control of information by your nparents,1191,227

1828,p6l5jd,0,2,What happened here  No contact ended  days ago  Background  my dad and I are both stubborn and alcoholic  But I reinitiated contact  days ago  And it’s relevant that I used to do his wound care all the time when I was in nursing school  I had hoped to hold on to living with him  but he kicked me out when my mom left  So my dad called me and these are my impressions from the phone call  he started out just saying that it wasn’t important but then he started talking about his legs  He said the chronic wounds on his legs were acting up and he started asking me advice about wound care dressingsBut he kept circling back to allude to the fact that he wanted someone  me  to come over and do wound care on him  So I told him… I said “please let me cut you off  You need home health  I don’t know if you have a Case Manager from all your previous surgical cases…  or if you need one… but YOU need to advocate for the case manager to refer you to home health wound care ”And he said no So then we started kind of talking about our schedules and he was carrying on for a very long time about when he thought his Amazon package of his wound care supplies that he ordered himself would be delivered… But i interrupted him again  and said  “you know what…  if you need me I will come over but I’m working on Thursday and I’m only available little bit on Wednesday… but if you call me…  I would come and you don’t have to say another word about it ”So then he talked for a really long time about how embarrassed he was  and how he didn’t want his family to know  and his doctor to know  that his legs were acting up  He just wanted to put these wound care dressings on them And so I said “OK listen… maybe this isn’t the most professional thing but I do have friends and sometimes I call on them to do simple assessments over the phone or… sometimes it’s really a doctor…or… I know wound care nurses…   This situation is outside of the realm of professionalism… but i could refer you to a friend of mine to get an initial assessment   She might say “go ahead and do your own stuff” or “you should get hydrafera blue dressings” or “you really need to go to to the hospital ” But I could phone a friend  And I know a case manager to who could like look at your stuff and she’d be able to tell you…” oh Aetna insurance  I completely understand  I know exactly what Documentation i need to authorize you for a home health wound care nurse ”And then he kind of started getting weird… like “I don’t know why I asked you for advice  I don’t mean to sound hostile…but just Nevermind   and I just I didn’t even mean to ask you  Just don’t tell anyone  ”And I said “well I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable I was offering you several solutions “so where did we leave  it “Do you want me to come over to do wound care or do you want me to ask my friends to assist you with your case management or wound care needs…or like…when  What time ”And he was all of a sudden obviously in a bad mood and he said in like the most sarcastic way…he’s like “you know what “Name” I love you  I got everything I needed  thanks” and then he hung up,3155,600
1829,p6kzem,0,2,NMom Dismissing my Entire Experience    As always  TL DR    I decided to explain to her my self harm story   why I fell into that horrible cycle  when I was   and guess what  She says it was not because of what I described to her and basically invalidated everything  Now  at   she repeatedly refers to my choice to  carve myself up  every time we fight  most recent fight where she said she would throw me down the stairs and kill me herself    amp  xB So Im F   History of self harm  depressive episodes and general anxiety  Im an only child   a third year university student  aiming for grad school  med school hopefully  and live with a single mom  I cook all the meals  I clean  do the chores  I study and work   my moms very sick so she cant do things very quickly  From a young age Ive been helping out My moms gone through a lot of abuse  struggles and has a chronic illness   shes also a shining example of an amazing professional  has  masters degrees  speaks multiple languages and is the peak of  going through it tough but surviving Shes also a Narcissistic Martyr   undiagnosed  but youll see why as I continue below  NOTE  I NEVER DISS SOMEONES TRAUMA AND LIFE EXPERIENCES  BUT I DO NOT AGREE WITH HURTING OTHERS AS A RESULT OF IT  Im her personal punching bag  Ive had to be her friend  mother at times  support  confidant  daughter    everything  Boundaries are not a thing  Privacy  lol  forget it Growing up I was always walking on eggshells Didnt go to prom Didnt go to school dances  in middleschool nor HS    I did go to one in elementary Had my phone checked often   Was not allowed to hang out with friends often   mostly only for birthday parties or specific events   and when I did she had to either be there or know the parents and if I was allowed to   it was for a short time only As a young child   fine I accepted this  After all my safety was her priority But it just made me sneakier Went to an all girls school for my whole school education Long story short I got a BF at   Fell in love  puppy love of course  and decided to tell my mom She disagreed  for many reasons  distraction to studies  he wasnt from our ethnic background  awful i know   he wasnt good enough for me  Break up with him  She said  as I sat across her over lunch  But why    I dont like him  no  Breakup ANd so I did   But I kept seeing him around at tutoring centre where I was enrolled  and for both of us who were shy  academically focused kids  this was a beautiful moment So for several weeks we broke up This ruined me  and I felt awful  it was exciting and happy for me to get a little valentines card  to have some affection  I was   studying hard to get into my college of choice I felt obliged to do what she said  But I felt compelled to not do it either I was self harming  slowly at first  Across my thighs and my stomach  IT gave me release  Dont ask me why  it just did And then we got back together secretly Seeing him was an hour or so here  a few minutes there  Some small drives  It was nothing disastrous  Dangerous or wrong But I felt guilty  I felt like the worst person on earth  I wanted to share the cute little moments with my mom  Something I had thought all girls will do   She always told me to trust her and tell her everything   yet over the years I had noticed everything I told her would come back to bite me in an argument   I had snuck him home one day   for only an hour  where we cooked a little as i had to have food ready before my mom came home  and spent time together And when my mom found out I did this Well  naturally  I was called a whore A lying Disobedient Whore  I hadnt even had sex but she never believed that Fights ensued  my phone was taken  Hair was pulled  She told him never to contact me again  And for months I was forced to go everywhere with her  Glued so she can watch me  So she can make sure I wasnt doing it again She read my private messages aloud and called me names for hours  My self harm flared and got worse  Im  and the scars havent really faded One day she saw my scars  I was changing and she walked in  I quickly tried to hide them but she forced me to show her my stomach  amp  xB  why would you do this  why would you do this to me  You want to hurt me  huh Hurt her  I was hurting her I couldnt come to her with my concerns or issues   she told me not to trust my friends because they all want the worst for me  she said people will look badly upon me because im a dirty whore for lying about having a boyfriend and she called up my friends to ask them what they knew  You wasted your senior year  you got bad marks  you were more interested in boys  you disregard everything ive gone through for you      Flash forward to now  Im   Fights continue every few months  When I do what she says  all things are fine But I cant go anywhere  Without her express knowledge  without her taking me there herself and waiting in the car for me    BUT ITS FOR YOU OWN SAFETY I CANT HAVE YOU DRIVING SO FAR AWAY   Privacy is still not a thing for me If i want privacy  its because I want  to hide something  Because  from a young age I have shown that I am a lying  selfish  lazy  whore  She wants me to find a nice guy from our culture   but if I meet someone she insists on reading all the texts  taking me to and from dates  listening in on calls    safe to say Ive only dated one guy in the last  years since  and that was only  dates cause he had enough of her meddling  and fair enough   Over the years Ive just gotten sneakier  Im an adult  I have friendships she cant control  and thoughts she cant overpower  I try my best to be resilient  and not fall into self harm again  although have relapsed countless times  Our fights are constant  horrific and often get violent  And it all goes back to her point     ever since you were  everything changed  youre not the daughter I knew      Lazy  Selfish  Ungrateful    Bitch    Whore   Crazy amp  xB I mean these are only a few of the epithets Ive hard chiseled into my heart from my mother My loving mother  who sacrificed her whole life to have me  Ive gone through so much  Ive given up everything  other mothers go out and have fun and I sacrificed all of this to raise you  I shouldve brought other men into the house but I didnt i stayed by you I didnt have any other relationships  you turned my house into a brothel     by bringing my then boyfriend over Youre ungrateful  youre spoiled  Ive given you too much freedom and too much opportunity and you respect nothing  Ive been sick with my chronic illness and I worked so hard to raise you and this is how you repay me    I usually ignore these fights  they usually occur after I try to set a boundary  Dont touch my phone  her answer  I PAY For that phone I get to see it  I cant come to you with my problems because you gaslight me and you yell at me  her answer   YOU KNOW ITS THE WRONG THING AND YOU DO IT ANYWAY  I cant afford to move out  so I live with her still   Anyway  now I have a boyfriend    The love of my life  the man Im hoping I will marry  cause we both come from abusive single parent homes and we understand each other well Anyway hes not from my culture  but i mean i literally do not give a shit   No one CHOOSES their race   And can I just say all of this culture business is covert racism and I do not give a fuck about endorsing it hes the most respectful  caring  supportive amazing human being and he loves me truly But   NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU LIKE ME  YOUR MOTHER DOES     NO ONE   Eh  I call bullshit  Because the older ive gotten the more I can see her flaws  She makes mistakes  Shes not the omniscient god she portrays herself to be  and iM sorry shes not a flawless martyr  Its NOT my responsibility to fill the voids in her life or to fix the abuse she went through Hurt people  hurt people  I get it  But ive had enough She never takes responsibility for hurting me  everything that I point out is disrespectful or wrong is disregarded because I am the child   The feet cannot hit the head  I am the feet   my moms the head    so regardless of what she says or does  She is correct Always She knows better Anyway  she says Ive changed recently  she doesnt know me and my bf are dating she knows we are friends  and I ignore her  In our most recent argument where I said Ive had enough of her invasion of my privacy  Shit hit the fan Youre spending too much time talking to that guy   he had given me notes for some classes and she picked them up and threw them everywhere on the ground things escalated I cant even be bothered to go into detail  yall already know how these things snowball  I went into my room packed a bag and said fuck this  im leaving Yeah I had   in my bank account and nowhere to go but fuck it  I was upset She comes into my room and says    EVERYTHING YOU OWN IS MINE I PAID FOR IT YOU CAN TAKE NOTHING GO WITH WHAT YOURE WEARING AND EVEN THAT IS MINE    We fight  we struggle  she pulls my hair as I try to leave  her hands are weak but boy can she hit   Once she had me on the floor in the corner and stepped on me as if I was a cockroach  but she says that never happened so idk guys maybe Im just crazy     Shes violently flailing at me and i push her off of me on the bed i dont want her touching me  I yell at her to get her hands off me Anyway  i manage to break free with this bag ive got and i get to the stairs and she says  IF you try to go I will push you down the stairs She threatens to fucking kill me right And I said  no im leaving idc Mind you  she tells me to go but i am her primary carer  shes not severly disabled itll just take her more time to do things that I usually assist her with   and the point is she doesnt WANT me to go because thatll be inconvient to her  amp  xB OH ALSO  she got offended once because I said when I leave and get married  she wont live in the same house as me and my husband  I mean  Obviously not Anyway the screaming match goes on for hours  Slut  whore  disgrace  dirty person  ungrateful  dishonest It doesnt end  I walked out of the house  andwithin minutes she calls me   i wasnt gonna answer  but I did  And she begged me to come back because its not safe  COVID is everywhere here too Anyway I did and we had another fight today over something completely menial Eventually im gonna move out  and I try my best to keep myself sane But Im angry and hurt Idk why I wrote all this  I just felt the need to get it out  amp  xB Yours truly The embarassing  selfish  whore from nextdoor,10808,1974
1830,p6kve9,0,9,Hypervigilance in romantic relationships Ive been doing some work in therapy and just wanted to check in to see if anyone else has this pattern  does your hypervigilance show up primarily in romantic relationships  I realized that Im so used to managing peoples moods watching out for red flags that I do this to my partner all the time  But Im able to maintain more boundaries with my friends because the stakes just dont seem as high  Friends could flake out on me  or vice versa  and it wouldnt be the end of the world  I know its just who they are  But if my partner cancels a plan at the last minute  I overreact and feel like our whole relationship is doomed  The people closest to me tend to trigger the most extreme anxiety  Im not sure if Im explaining this clearly  or if its even related to having nparents  Just curious to see who can relate,866,157

1833,p6kmae,0,4,Mom steals my things and lies about it Hey guys Im not really sure how to handle this situation but I didnt realize it was happening up until a few months ago  The first instance was when I was about to leave on a trip with my friends  I was gonna pack Uno  which I always leave under my deck of Cards Against Humanity  but it was gone  I asked my siblings and none of them had seen it  I asked my mom and she said  I dont touch your guys stuff so I dont know  and I could tell she was mad that I even asked  I picked up on this and accused my brother on purpose so that she would admit it  She didnt admit it  she took them out from the hallway closet and said  it looks like you left them in here   Mind you  I never put anything in that closet because thats where we keep the towels and toilet paper lmao  She sounded so convincing I even felt crazy for a second  The most recent instance  just now  I had my candle that I got for my st birthday on my TV stand  Its always propped up on a wooden coaster right next to my mug  When I was watching TV just now  I noticed the mug was on the coaster in place of where the candle would usually be  It didnt even fit on the coaster so it was just lopsided and completely out of place  I confronted my mom again and she sais she dropped it when she was in my room and didnt wanna drop it again so she put it in the hallway closet  Its always like walking on eggshells when I talk to her and I have no idea what to do anymore or how to even approach this  She makes me feel crazy when she says it wasnt her doing and I always end up frantically looking for these items  not realizing most of the time that she steals little things so that I dont notice until way later or dont even bother bringing it up  She also draws symbols on my pictures I have with friends  Is it unreasonable for me to feel mad about this  Because she guilts me when I get upset about it and I dont even know how to express my feelings now  Please help TLDR  my mom lies about stealing from me and gets upset when I bring it up  how do I approach this,2092,421
1834,p6kepc,0,2,A discovery I made today Today in therapy  I  F  realized that Im allowed to grieve for the dad I really didnt get as a child  I went NC with my dad because he violated my boundaries and tried manipulating me into doing things I was uncomfortable with  Also  hes mentally unstable and dabbles in alcohol and drugs  Even though my mom makes jokes about nobody loving him and telling me to stop being sad on Fathers Day  my therapist helped me realize that I dont have to be happy and grateful all the time  Im allowed to miss my dad  Im allowed to reminisce about good times Ive had with him and yearn for reconciliation again Also  Ive learned that its not just my dad whos like this  My mom says things to me that are downright abusive  Im in denial about it  but she disrespects me regularly and does not respect my boundaries  I learned that I can be angry at her too  Both of my parents have caused me a lot of anxiety and depression  I don’t have to be grateful for any of that  I am allowed to be angry  It feels so good to get that off my chest  I can’t wait to start my own life and go to college,1121,215
1835,p6kbxk,0,2,Been a rough day First post here so hope I do this right…I’d  F  been doing well recently in dealing surviving with my awful family until today  I’ve found a volunteer activity that I love  gets me out of the house  I love the great people I volunteer with  it’s really helping with my terrible self confidence  and I’m only a few months away from finally paying off my student loans  the payments were so much each month that I’ve had to live at home with my family while I pay them off so I can afford payments for my own place to live  Then today was awful  I woke up and found out my younger brother had a sore throat headache cough etc and so he was staying home from his job  He works at the same warehouse as my mom  is autistic  but is not very “high functioning”    so basically he stayed home because he tends to not deal with illness well and my mom just “didn’t want to deal with him” getting upset at work today  he gets frustrated that he can’t just take a magic pill or something to make a cold back pain whatever’s bothering him go away instantly and so he basically throws a fit like a little kid would   So this is just great news for me   while I’m fully vaccinated  my job is pretty strict on following CDC guidelines while we’re in the office  I was supposed to go in to the office today  so I had to text my boss this morning so she can confirm that no  I can’t come in to work today because we don’t know what my brother has  Best part is  my parents think Covid is just fake news or a plot by the government to control people  The fact that I just quit a second job not too long ago where I was working as an EMT for a private ambulance company and actually had Covid positive people in my ambulance on my shifts  Nope  not even having a healthcare worker in their family who saw proof Covid exists can convince them Covid is real  Of course no one else in my family besides me is vaccinated… my brother with his disability doesn’t know any better than what my parents tell him so he’s been just as careless as my parents have during this whole pandemic  So he could very well have Covid… or he could just have a cold  I might never know what he’s sick with because my parents laughed at me when I suggested they see if he can get tested  Because he “doesn’t have Covid” because Covid isn’t real to them  They’ve been extra nasty with me all day today for daring to mention that he should get tested and for trying to explain how not knowing what he has puts my life in limbo  Can’t go in to work or do volunteer work if I might’ve been exposed to Covid  and dad just mocked me for it  “oh what’s the matter  can’t go out and volunteer  Inconveniencing your job  Wow that’s just too bad isn’t it  Oh boo hoo ”I’ve been getting either the silent treatment or nasty comments thrown my way all day  you know how the anti mask Covid denying crowd is   I had to rearrange work things with my boss today because we’re in the middle of our busiest time of year  and now me being back to working from home everyday instead of in the office messes up the plan  I think my boss understands I can’t help my family being like this  I hope she’s not just saying that but actually thinking I’m a pain in the ass and holding this whole thing against me now  Can’t go in to the office for awhile now  All because my brother won’t get tested so I know what I’m dealing with  I’ve been trying not to worry about what if my brother does have Covid and I get sick from it even though I’m vaccinated  He was wandering around the house all day coughing on everything Worst of all though is how this whole situation is probably going to sideline me for awhile from the volunteer work I do  I’m on a search and rescue  SAR  team and I love it  It’s been the one bright light since I’ve been stuck living at home paying off student loans  The people on my team are wonderful… sane  caring  funny  smart  mentors to me in SAR and just in general as far as what it’s like to know older people who aren’t terrible people like my parents are  It’s done wonders for my awful self confidence  really  my self confidence dwells in the pits   I think they might actually like having me around on the team  which is huge for me to feel like I’m accepted belong somewhere  And hell  I get to help people and maybe find a missing person at the same time which is freakin great But I’m not sure how I can go to meetings trainings actual searches for the next week or so knowing my brother could have Covid and I could get my team sick or the other area SAR teams that we search with sick  I have an annual fitness test in a few days that I have to pass to stay on the team and I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go now  My parents just couldn’t care less about what’s important to me  my whole life they never have  or how their actions  in this case thinking a global pandemic is a total joke  affect anyone else  Once again my parents ruin a good thing I enjoy doing  It really puts me in an awfully sad place knowing I probably shouldn’t do SAR for the next week or so  so that I don’t risk getting anyone sick  If they could’ve taken the pandemic seriously or would at least get my brother tested maybe I wouldn’t be in this position And what prompted me to post this now  We literally just had a SAR request come through for us to go look for a missing person and I had to make myself say no because I’m worried I could get them all sick with whatever my brother has  What if it is Covid   I don’t want getting my teammates sick on my conscience  So I’m sitting here feeling like I’m letting my team down and I’m also completely miserable because I can’t go out and help look for this missing person  All because my parents think Covid is a joke and refuse to take my brother to get tested for Covid  Just the worst way to end a real awful day and I feel terrible and furious Tonight Im probably going to cry a little more  hope Covid isn’t circulating in this house  and hope this missing person is found by the SAR folks that could go out Tomorrow I’m going to start asking people I know to recommend a realtor   see if I can start the condo buying process  And I’m going to call my doctors office and beg them to write me an order to be  tested for Covid  stupid HMO plan rules  or at least see if they can give me advice for how long I should avoid going out in public when someone in my house has a mystery illness  As much as this day is hurting  I’m not going to have much more like this because I’m determined to get out soon  I’m

1836,p6kbqw,0,3,NDad denies any of the trauma he’s caused me So i’m posting this on my mobile device so i’m sorry for any errors or whatever anyways  for years my mom has said how my dad is a N  and honestly as i get older i can sorta see it  but i will be honest  i love my dad and he has always been there for me  especially through my parents divorce  but now that i look back on it  i can see how my dad wanted me to potentially testify against my mom in court  which i can’t remember what it was now but it was probably about something i was mad at when i was younger   eventually  i grew older and i grew closer to my mom  especially during COVID   but almost a year ago  i just got my license and i’m a little new to the road  but my dad tried to get me to drive the highway after only about having my license for a couple of days  i said no and my dad gets into an argument about how i should just do it  eventually we stop and get gas  and i’ve calmed down so i suggested that i drive the rest of the way  not on the highway   he ends up sleeping in the back while i drive  and my sister and i swear that we saw him drinking some whiskey shooters in the back of the car  we eventually make it to our destination and he suggests we should go to a friends house that is currently being built  all of HIS friends are there and it’s just my sister and i  eventually one of my family friends comes and we were talking upstairs in the sun  my dad and his friend tried going up an unstable ladder when there was stairs  ft away  my dad climbed up the ladder with a drink in his hands  he made it almost to the top but then the ladder went out from under him  i was in shock and my family friend rushed to go help him  she ended up saving him but minutes later my dad forgets completely that he almost died and his daughters would have watched  i came to the conclusion that i was done with this situation and i felt that if i stayed i could potentially hurt my entire family  so my sister and i left with my family friend WILLINGLY my dad  maybe  mins later  notices were gone and demands we come back to him  we don’t but he calls the police saying we were kidnapped  the police come and we said we went willingly with my friend  my dad didn’t like that and tried to get us back  eventually my sister and i get back home and we are just shocked that this has happened  my dad called texted us   for at least   weeks  now  a year later he denies this situation EVER happened and has avoided any sort of apologies that i feel i need to get better   now a year later  another situation has happened where we found out he was abusing drugs  he admitted doing drugs but i honestly think he only admitted it because his family was there  now a couple of months later he denies doing drugs and i feel like he’s lying about going to therapy  honestly  i just want to know if my dad really is a N  and i want to know how i should deal with him in the future,2963,592

1839,p6k7rd,0,3,Everything is perfect  until its not  So  I grew up being told by my family that we were a perfect family  that we had a perfect life  and that we didnt need anyone else but the family  Ive only recently fully realized how wrong that was  and how traumatized I am by my upbringing  Ive been emotionally and verbally abused by both of my parents since I was a child  in various different ways  including isolation  They refused to send us  me and my younger sibling  to school  The only friends I had were ones I would meet around town when I was allowed out to play  Even then I was always told that I focus too much on  outside people  and that I was always looking for validation from others when all I needed was them  something they still say to me now  even though I am an adult in my s  Adding a lack of close family  my parents not having friends  and being raised very religiously  created two kids who were very codependent on their parents  which is how they like it  The worst part is that it took me so long to realize all of this because of how loving they both are toward us  It made the fairytale of us being this perfect family seem very true and real to me for so long  They even used our so called perfect life as a reason that my sibling and I shouldnt have any mental problems  which they would deny now if I mentioned it  but then again they would deny any of this has any merit  even though I know it does  Even now though  I am worried to move out  although I really want to  Because I have always been told I have no reason to do so  that rent is expensive  that Id never make it out there  that I need to stay here with them  I am still going to move out  very soon  but I know it will come with guilt trips and manipulation to try and make me stay  I have pondered if its worth the pit in my stomach that comes along with it  but I know it is  I know that until I get out Ill never get to finally live and actually experience anything,1972,386

1851,p6jet4,0,3,I dont want to understand  The last few days have been so emotionally draining for me  It all started when I got an email from my n mom on Saturday  This is weird  because she never initiates contact  especially not over email  usually I call her and she talks endlessly about her life   The email says she wants to talk privately about something  and everyone is ok   So  no one is dying  I guess thats good  She also wants to talk over FaceTime  which is weird considering she hates video calls  I have no idea what she wants to talk about  but my partner and I speculate  maybe my parents are divorcing  maybe their business failed  maybe its some weird inheritance  My partner suggests its her calling to tell me she hates them  I schedule the call for Saturday knowing I have an appointment with my therapist on Tuesday to unpack it all When I get on FaceTime with her  we exchange a few pleasantries  and then she says   I assume you know why I want to talk to you   I respond that I do not know  Then she proceeds to tell me how she is shocked and appalled that my partner has been showing signs of being non binary  I know that my partner has been recently becoming more comfortable sharing that they are non binary online  including with a profile picture where they were wearing makeup  She says some things to indicate that shes seen this photo  She also talks about how my cousins kid recently came out as non binary and wants to become a woman  Her opinion is that being non binary means that you dont know what you want and your desired partner will change day to day  She then suggests that   in my book  this is grounds for annulment   She literally just told me to divorce my partner  whom I love  because she is afraid of them being non binary  At this point  my mind is spinning   what have I gotten myself into  So many thoughts going through my mind  I try to keep my cool and defend my partner  I dont want her to have the satisfaction of getting a rise out of me  I also point out that I am on the non binary spectrum  but because I was born female  thats somehow different to her  I asked her if I could provide some book recommendations to understand the difference between gender and sexuality  and her response was   I dont read  I dont want to understand  After several more derogatory statements about non binary and trans folx  she then shifts the conversation towards how she thinks my partner is not caring enough  Apparently   in her opinion  they are the reason Ive switched jobs  times in the last year  the reason I dont talk to her or her siblings  and the reason that I seem  so sad in the last few years   They also dont hold the door enough for me  Apparently  before I met my partner  my parents and I were a close  happy family with no issues  Unfortunately  she forgot about the part where she forced me to go to the same school she went to  where she broke into my email in the middle of the night  where she and my e dad would get drunk at the Mexican restaurant and talk about other people in the restaurant  where she freaked out that I didnt believe in the same religion as her  even though she never went to church herself   Throughout this whole conversation  she keeps switching between the topic at hand and doting on her cat  who obviously doesnt want to be held   as if its no big deal  She also suggests that I was starting to  get over  my introversion before I met my partner  and that they made me backslide on that  Introversion is not something to  get over    its a part of me  She finished the call by adding in some racist complaints before we ended the call Fast forward one day  and I get a message from my cousin  who rarely initiates conversations with me  She starts by asking something pretty tame  then after I respond  asks if I will visit home and tries to guilt me about visiting my grandma  and also tries to pull my nostalgia heartstrings  I recognize her flying monkey tactics  and dont engage with this  I can only imagine the rumors circulating in my n moms family about how I apparently need an intervention to get away from my non binary partner who has supposedly trapped me in a marriage Before all of this  I was under no illusion that my n mom liked my partner  but this really sealed the deal  My therapist was really upset by this story as well  After I write each of my parents letters to explain how I feel  as my therapist suggested  I think this might be the point at which I finally go NC with my parents,4528,823
1852,p6jbjb,0,3,Cutting off my mom Hey guys  I’m sure this has been posted before at some point  but I’ve just recently cut my mom off and could use some advice  To give you some backstory  she is a kleptomaniac  pathological liar  cheater and most importantly  a narcissist  She was in and out of jail for a few years of the beginning of my life  and when she “came back” she was nothing but neglectful and emotionally  mentally and sometimes physically abusive  I have never in my life experienced another person like her  She is beyond selfish and ignorant  and has only ever apologized for the things she’s done to me when she was drunk or needed something from me  To sum it up  she ruined so many parts of my life  It was about  weeks ago that something inside of me finally clicked where I was at my wits end  but actually this time  She is blocked on everything  I moved out and have no plans to ever reconcile  For the past  years all that she has proven is that she doesn’t want to change and she does not care who it hurts  In the last couple days she has texted my brother and my dad to ask them if I miss her or if I’ll call her  It’s crazy because since cutting her off  I genuinely feel much lighter and that I finally have freedom  but I want to tell her off so badly to the point where it’ll keep me up at night even though i know it will make zero difference  I know that I won’t do it most likely because not only would i still be unsatisfied but it will just feed her ego  I also still find myself feeling guilty for cutting her off  even though this time she has no way to guilt trip me  What are some tips or any advice for truly moving forward  Or any advice for this type of situation in general,1707,333
1853,p6ipc8,0,23,Should I go NC with nparents before announcing engagement  Hi all  Ive been lurking here for a while  This sub  and my therapist  have helped me navigate a lot of things as an adult child of nparents but I still have no idea where to start with this post😅 I  F  have been LC with my enabling covert nmum  ndad and gc flying monkey brother since April this year  I went NC  years ago after moving out of home  They started a smear campaign amongst all my extended family literally the same night  If those relatives didnt bully me  they ignored me  Some to this day  still refuse to acknowledge my existence because of how I  broke up the family  and hurt my parents by moving out so suddenly  I was pressured by relatives into speaking to my parents again  Being back in contact for  ish months last year just reminded me why I left  My nparents have not changed  they are just on their best behaviour which is so much more sinister and a total mindfuck  The effects of the initial smear campaign still traumatizes me so I have just been LC until I have gathered enough strength to decide what to do next  Trial and error I suppose  My partner  M  and I have been together since the same time I moved out  so sadly he was also dragged into the smear campaign and relatives accused him of  stealing  me away and  influencing  me  We have talked a lot about whether we want my side of the family involved in our lives much longer  He told me he plans to propose within the next few months and as excited as I am  I am also incredibly stressed because I know my family will try to exert their control and dominance over the entire thing  They wont be happy for me but they will absolutely wear the news like a badge to show off to everyone around them  They have overshadowed so many moments in my life  I dont want it to happen with this one  Deep down  I know going NC again with my parents will be in the cards   maybe the only card  I cant keep up LC long term  As much as I was in pain when I first went NC  I also had peace of mind like no other point in my life  I knew where I stood and so did everyone else  even if they were making a fuss about it  And just remembering how they acted when I moved out vs every other important milestone in my life  ranging from mockery  bullying  threats  sabotaging any plans i e  my st birthday party and even when I was starting my bachelors to physical violence and intimidation   I cant help but feel like I need to prepare in advance for how who I share our good news with when my partner proposes  I already knew at  years old I did not want my father walking me down the aisle and I cant see that conversation going down well  I already know Ill be hiring security bouncers for the day and wont be inviting   of his family to the wedding when it happens which also wont go down well  but hopefully they know better than to still expect niceties from a niece they abandoned and ostracized when she was in need  eye roll  Is it worth having these conversations and confronting them when the time comes to draw the line  Do I wait for them to fuck up somehow so I can cut them off or do I just rip the bandaid off now  seemingly unprovoked and risk the backlash way before it can possibly overshadow this next chapter in my life  Do I need to give them an explanation if I go NC Would appreciate your stories or suggestions♡ whether you are LC or NC TLDR  partner plans to propose soon   we  know relationship with my nparents is more harm than good  have been on the fence about keeping them in our lives for future milestones  Wait for them to show their true colours again or just go NC,3674,691

1857,p6i6ui,0,3,My Ndad invited me for his birthday in the house that he lives with his girlfriend and Im really tired of pretending that he is a good normal person and father  And I hate myself for still being unemployed and needing his financial support Living with my mother  but the income she has is not enough  and also is a emotionally immature person and thus makes difficult to discuss and make plans to try to lower our expenses  live in a cheaper place and etc   I have psychiatric and psychotherapy treatments to pay and also lost a few years to severe depression and anxiety  did a college degree that I was pressured and yelled at to do it  while at the same time saw most of my college friends working and having a life  having good moments with friends and family  My country is also a mess in both political and economical spheres and is also a case of big worry for me  one of the worst responses to covid in the world  threats of coup détat and chronic economic struggles,979,180

1859,p6hxr3,0,3,Its the little stuff that sticks in my brain while I recover and go to therapy  When I was about  and my GC brother was nine  his boyscout troop went to the planetarium and I got to tag along  I was asked to watch the boys while the adults talked  there was some sort of delay  and I told them all myths about the stars  For the only time in my life  I kept an audience absolutely spellbound with stories from ancient myths  I had just read them  you see  so they were fresh in my mind  I loved the stars  I had star charts in my room  and I wanted a telescope  Well  my parents got my GC brother a telescope for Christmas  And even though he truly didnt care about it  and he was more than happy to share  I wasnt allowed to use it at all  In college I took an astronomy course  and my father threw a fit that I was thinking about making it my major   no jobs anyway  he said  a foolish impractical thing to study  He said that about every major  but he was particularly vocal about astronomy  Math was never my strong suite anyway so I didnt pursue astronomy  Three years ago  at Christmas  my GC little brother gave me a brand new telescope  Not an expensive one  hes not a well off man  but the gesture cut me to the soul  I thanked him for remembering I like the stars  and he said yeah  of course  It was a gesture that meant a lot to me and seemed to be a gesture of kindness from him  But I cant bring myself to use the damn thing  I cant get rid of it  its the only thoughtful gift my brothers ever given me  And I cant open it  for some reason  I just dont know why I cant bring myself to use it,1628,321
1860,p6hv6i,0,5,DAE have a N in their life who pretended they didn’t hear them  Growing up I’d often try to talk to my parents while they watched tv  yknow  like a normal kid  But sometimes I’d ask them something  can I go over to a friends house or whatever  and they’d act like they didnt hear me  Mind you  the television wasn’t loud at all  They’d wait for  min to pass and then reply to the question like nothing ever happened  Weird as fuck  I always thought it was just an odd control thing  amp  am curious if anyone else has experienced this too,543,103
1861,p6hup2,0,3,My nmom kept me on an SSRI for  years because  Temple Grandin takes Prozac   My nmom kept me on SSRIs from the time I was  until I was  and I flushed them down the toilet She had heard that Temple Grandin takes Prozac  or some other SSRI  and somehow the   Temple Grandin is autistic and she takes an SSRI and she says it can be good for some people with autism  so Im going to bully a psychiatrist into prescribing my autistic daughter Prozac  Prozac did a whole lot of absolutely nothing for me  and Im wondering if its possible that the depression Ive dealt with for the past  years could possibly be  in part  from taking an SSRI for so long so young and my brain never learning how to properly deal with serotonin  And  Ive got long term anorgasmia and a low sex drive that is possible that Prozac factored into  but theres no way to know for sure Im sick of my screwed up brain  and its hard to not be mad at my nmom for keeping me on meds  and my nparents and nbrother for demonizing me for not taking meds  They expected Prozac to turn me into a robot  and whenever I was a    human    with    free will    and    emotions     they would say  You didnt take your meds  You need to take your meds   even though I was taking them every single day  It was just a chance to demonize me By the way  Prozac had  effect on me,1352,254
1862,p6hnjw,0,5,months officially NC with my Nmom and her enabling family  ask me anything    hey guys f  thought i would share my story  so my whole life my mom was abusing me and always had narc traits  but i didn’t realize until i was about  because that’s when it got worse  I grew into my own individuality and rejected her idea of having the perfect image all the time and being a completely different person behind closed doors  I was beaten if i didn’t clean my bathroom to her standards and she would make me stay up until   am on school nights because I didn’t clean to her standards   often times she would threaten to kick me out of “her room” because of this  my room was never super trashy so i never understood this she beat me because i wore makeup to school  keep in mind i am now a whole makeup artist influencer with thousands of views and company collaborations  i’m sure she hates this secretly but would put on a front   whenever i did makeup at home she would basically shame me   scream and tell me i needed to find something better to do with my time she would be nice to me for weeks and then just get really angry and snap for no reason  hold grudges  etc my family knew about this and would simply tell me to stop getting mad CPS case after case   which were all closed because no one could even believe a WOMAN would put her hands on her own daughter  she lied every time and said i was “rebellious “   when i was  she got jealous of the fact that i stayed out till  with my BOYFRIEND at the time that she supposedly liked so much  she argued with me the next day and got physically abusive and essentially fought me till i was bleeding from my mouth lived with my grandma  dormed at colleged   came back for summer vacation  i was now     mother made a surprise appearance and fought me again  this time   with my bf on facetime  she argued with him and said every childish thing you could think of moved out to my bfs house after the police STILL tried to justify this as us having a scuffle  been here ever since family was stalking my social media from fake accounts and never reached out to talk to me  nobody knows where i am  nobody knows about my well being  I guess it’s better that way my current bf never fails to make me feel loved and tells me daily how much of a beautiful person i am  inside and out to any person still stuck in this situation   i know its scary  but when you turn   it’s perfectly okay to run and not go back to the abuse  your mental health will thank you,2547,483

1865,p6h0jh,0,228,It turns out  I have had an ear infection for the last  years or so  Around age  I started having itchy ears  They would peel and bleed and crust over  My parents asked a doctor about it and she said it was eczema and told them to put Lubriderm lotion on them  My mother really liked making me come into her room so that she could apply the lotion to my ears  This happened for years  and they never got any better  but my parents never tried to find out more about it  I wasnt allowed to put the lotion on myself  even in th grade  At some point my mother started applying the lotion with a q tip  I didnt like this because she wasnt very coordinated with the q tip  Also I didnt like that I was in th grade or so and not allowed to put lotion on myself  I told her that I didnt like the q tip method  She said that she had to use a q tip  or that the eczema would spread to her fingers  I told her eczema is not contagious   It is not   She said that it was because she had started to notice it on one of her fingers  She continued summoning me to her bedroom  often while I had a friend over so she could smear lotion on my ears until sometime in middle school But do you know what is contagious  Fungal skin infections  Which I have in my ears  And which I believe I have had untreated since i was  years old  In fact  adding a lotion probably makes it worse  I am treating it now  age    but it is taking a long time to heal  And my hearing is damaged because of the years of infection  I probably got it in a sandbox or something  Jesus Christ  Why did they not get me medicine,1603,317
1866,p6gwdi,0,27,I just can’t stop crying I finally left home yesterday the way I’d always wanted to  I packed up everything that was important to me and left without saying anything  I didn’t want my parents and I to fight  I didn’t want them to hit me or yell at me or hurt the person that was helping me so I did it in a way that would prevent all of that  I had a full blown panic attack before trying to go to bed because I kept thinking if this was the right decision or not  if my mom was going to find me and hurt me  if she’d show up at a friends house and hurt them  I’m miles away and I can’t stop thinking that   I can’t stop thinking about whether or not I’m a selfish horrible person who left without saying anything and ran from my problem  Is it normal to feel this guilty over trying to save yourself from any more pain  I just can’t stop crying and I don’t really know what to do anymore  what am I supposed to tell myself,926,188

1868,p6gqiw,0,11,Dear mom  letter that I’ll never send    Hi everyone  This is my first post here  I look at all of yours daily and relate to a lot of them  This subreddit helps me feel less alone  Thank you for sharing your experiences and helping others feel less alone in this world  My therapist suggested that I write this as a way to forgive my mother  Not for her sake  but for mine  I finally have the courage to make a post  although I’m not sure how confusing it may be for strangers  as it doesn’t explain a lot of what I’m referencing  Trigger warning  childhood sexual trauma Dear mom I don’t know where to begin with this letter  I wish I could really say these things to you and know that you will listen and actually care  actually take the time to admit some faults and choose to change yourself for the better  All my life I’ve loved you more than is probably healthy  I spent the better part of my childhood adolescence worrying about you  I don’t remember a time in my life that you have ever been truly happy  and to this day  it hurts me a lot  I wish that you cared about your happiness in the same way that I care about it  From the time I can remember as a little kid  you were always so stressed out and upset  every day  A lot of how you felt rubbed off on me  I can remember growing up how I always would frantically clean the house before you got home  fluff the pillows on the couches  dump the ashtrays in the trash  wipe the coffee table  counters  and kitchen table off  Make sure sis and I’s room was clean  I remember thinking maybe if everything was “perfect” that it would somehow change your mood  because I knew how important having a clean house was to you  Now  I have to have a clean house in order to feel secure and comfortable Do you remember when I was  years old  and you found out that sis and I had ‘seen’ cousin B’s penis from Aunt M and dad  Do you know how scary it was when you came home and got angry with us  acted as if whatever we had gone through was just one more stress added to your plate  You didn’t even ask us if we were okay  You just said “well  I guess you’ll have to stay with your Aunt M tonight while I go to darts ” And then I said no  mommy  it will be okay  Cousin B won’t hurt us  and told you that we didn’t want to go to Aunt M or dads  And instead of being a reasonable adult  you listened to me  your child  the  year old who didn’t even know that what was happening to her was wrong  Did you know that because of that  I carried that with me for the rest of my life  thinking that it was my fault that you got in trouble with DHS the first time  and it was my fault that the family was never the same The day that littler sis’s dad called the police because of what she said about cousin B  I remember coming home from school to you frantically running around  packing our stuff up  You had always treated me like a little adult  but I feel that from this day forward I was never a child again  You didn’t tell me what littler sis said  but you told me enough  That we had to get out right now  that you didn’t have the money to get us out  but it wasn’t an option  that we were losing littler sis  I helped you pack our things as you fell apart  That wasn’t the first time I saw that  as several months before that you broke down to me about G leaving you for your best friend  who was like an aunt to sis  littler sis  and I  I worried about you  As an  year old child  I worried about you  So much  When we moved into the duplex and had to do supervised visits with G and T  ex best friend  to see littler sis  it hurt me too  I know it hurt you horribly  and I am so sorry that you had to go through that  But I was there too  I was with you  I felt not only your pain  but I felt my own  I felt the loss of two adults in my life who I did love  I felt the loss of my baby sister too In that time  I remember that grandma and grandpa had given me a disposable camera to take pictures with my friends  So  I took it to school and took pictures with my friends  Veering more towards   years old at that point  L and I had taken pictures of each other in some awkward  laying down pose in the tunnels in the playground at school  I don’t know how the camera ended up at L’s house  probably because her mom would babysit us a lot  Do you remember  You came home one day  mad at me  crying and yelling at me  you pulled out those pictures of us laying down in the tunnel and told me that you were disgusted with me  You said that we were trying to be “sexy”  You made fun of us  and told me how gross that was  In that same conversation  you pulled out pages from my diary  This part is still weird to me  because I remember you saying that I had given the pages to L and told her to hide them so that you wouldn’t see them  I don’t remember doing that  but at the same time  I don’t really remember writing the pages either  Anyway  in those pages  I had written that I hated you  I remember you focusing hard on that  making me feel guilty for writing such a thing  Saying that I was ungrateful and unkind and asking me how could I do such a thing  And I remember feeling like the worst kid ever  I felt ungrateful  unkind  and dirty During that time I also started having what I now know is PTSD  I couldn’t sleep at night  You dated a bit  but even when you weren’t dating  and nobody was there but you  I would lay awake hearing pornography sounds blaring like a loudspeaker in my ears  Cousin B made me watch porn  Sometimes he would put it on and sit me in his lap and touch me and kiss me like I was his girlfriend or something  And as a kid  I thought that the sounds were of women in pain  I didn’t understand sex  I thought when you were having sex that you were being hurt  You were always very loud when you had sex when I was growing up  but I know now that I don’t think I was always really hearing you  the sounds were in my head  I remember waking you up night after night after night  As a child  I didn’t know how to communicate to you what was happening to me  I would just cry and say I couldn’t sleep  You would be annoyed  get up  give me Benadryl  again and again  and tell me to go back to bed  I remember wanting so badly for you to just hold me and comfort me  but you never did  and I didn’t know how to ask you for it After getting littler sis back you were dating a guy for a while  I walked in on you and him having sex one night when I was having one of my episodes  You got angry and yelled at me to go back to my room  and don’t come in your room without knocking  which had never been a rule in our household before  The next day you asked me what was going on  why I wasn’t sleeping  I wish I could remember what my tiny voice said to you  All I know is that I must have kind of communicated what was wrong  but not well enough  You had the guy sleep in the living room for a couple of weeks and I did sleep better  I remember you mentioning taking me to see a counselor  And I was okay with that  I wanted the help  But then  after a couple of weeks  the guy was back in your bed  And when I tried to talk to you about it  you basically said “get over it  he’s my boyfriend  we’re going to sleep in the same bed ” At some point  I recognized that my “episodes” were so much of a bother to you  that I stopped even going to you for help  I just continued having horrible sleep because of these horrible symptoms  The sound of sex in my ears  which to me equated to pain  My heartrate up to intense levels  sweating  dizziness  to the point of feeling like I might throw up  Horrible anxiety  Feeling extremely frightened  Not sleeping even effected my school life  I had always been a straight A student  and during my th grade year when we were going through this  I started “daydreaming” the teachers would call it  My grades started slipping because I stopped paying attention  I would say it’s really the furthest thing from day dreaming  It was more like awake nightmares Once we moved to the house  the next thing that I remember vividly is that I was laying on the couch watching TV  and I put my hand in my pants  I know now that that wouldn’t be socially acceptable to do while laying on the couch with people around  but I was a kid  And instead of asking me to do that in private  you snapped on me  you told me that I was disgusting and said to not do that  You made me get up and wash my hands  In that moment  you made me feel like I was dirty  AGAIN  As a CHILD  The PTSD symptoms continued throughout all of my teenage years when living with you  though only when you had a man sleeping in your room  I used the tv to distract myself  but you and your mother were against the TV being on for more than the set hour at bedtime  If I got caught turning it back on  I would get in trouble  Once I got a cell phone  I would then use that to distract myself by getting on social media or texting people  Before too long  you caught on to that too  and would take my phone at night  Now I realize that both the tv not being on and not using my cell phone are reasonable things for a parent to do with a typical child  But I wasn’t typical  I had mental health issues that were being denied all over the place Do you remember when I was  ish  and sis and I got into a fight  and she said that she hated me  My reaction as a CHILD was to go to the bathroom and to try to take as many Ibuprofen as I could swallow  Sis followed me to the bathroom and started freaking out  You came in  and your reaction  AS USUAL was to get angry with me  you yelled at me and said I was being attention seeking  and to never do that shit again  You shamed me  then sent me to bed  No concern came from you  You didn’t think  wow  my kid has got some problems  maybe I should get her some help    When I was  you had your “sex talk” with me which basically was you saying that as a teenager  my having sex was inevitable because that’s what teenagers do  and that you didn’t want me to get pregnant  so when I was in a relationship that I would need to be on birth control  So when I was   and with A  you took me to get the DEPO shot After being with A for several months  he was pressuring me to have sex with him  I remember feeling like I didn’t really want to  because I didn’t really like the way it made me feel  it brought back my PTSD issues  I tried to talk to you again about what happened to me  I told you that I needed your help  Your reaction was to say “I don’t want to hear this” and to walk away from me  I really needed you there  mom  I needed you to tell me that if I wasn’t ready  if I needed to see a counselor first to be sure that I knew what I was getting into  but you didn’t  you chose to avoid my truth for your own benefit  And so I did have sex with A  No  it wasn’t painful  but it wasn’t enjoyable either  I didn’t necessarily want to  it didn’t “feel good”  I did it because I thought that was just what you’re supposed to do when you’re in a relationship with someone  I thought that the feelings I was having about myself and the sexual encounters were just “normal” girl feelings  And I carried that same expectation about sex through every relationship that I had after that until I got with my current boyfriend and started going to therapy When I was   and cousin B sent me a message saying that he was in love with me and had always been in love with me  after also apologizing for what he did to me so many times over Facebook message  I felt really freaked out and also had a feeling of “she’ll finally have to believe me”… and you did  finally believe me  you took it into your own hands  made it about you  You messaged cousin B and stirred shit up in the family  which a part of me felt relieved about because you finally believed me  but then another part of me felt and still feels that you made it all about yourself  You finally helped find me a counselor  who ended up damaging the way I viewed reaching out for help for a long time  And when I decided to stop going  you were more than happy with my decision  When I got on medication for my mental health  you guilted me into stopping taking it even though I felt that it was helping me  You said that you didn’t like the person that it was making me  and I listened  because I cared about how I made you feel  You told me that if I reported cousin B that you wouldn’t forgive me  because he’s our family and that it would tear our family apart  I’m not saying I ever would have wanted to  but the fact that you couldn’t even support me  your own child  because in your eyes our so called “family” is more important than what I had been through  that is just really messed up You pushed me to make things right with him a few years later  and so I did show up to a couple of things that him and his wife were at when they came to town to appease you and other family members  even though it made me uncomfortable  You didn’t care about how uncomfortable it made me  when sis was uncomfortable about doing a family picture one of the last times that he came to town  I shouldered the blame for that because I knew that she needed what I always needed from you  Protection  someone safe to trust  someone who wouldn’t blab her feelings to every family member that she saw  And I know that to this day you and your sisters judge me for that  even though it wasn’t for me  it was for my sister  and I would do it AGAIN and AGAIN  no matter what  because I would stand by her no matter what she chose to do about what happened to her  THAT is what family does  Not lie and deny and avoid because it makes others more comfortable Since I’ve started therapy  my life has improved so much  It’s been a slow and steady improvement that I am really proud of  even if I still have my major moments of doubt about myself and what I am doing  I wish that you could be proud of me  I wish that you could see where I started  and where I’ve gotten  but it feels like all that you can see is that I’m harder to manipulate and that is too difficult for you  For all the times that you yelled at me for being depressed and belittled me for having feelings that I couldn’t explain or control  fuck you  mom  For all of the times that I needed you to be there for me  but instead you were cold  indifferent  and pushed me away  FUCK YOU  For all of the times that I let my depression take over and you called me lazy  fuck you  For all of the moments that I admitted that I was sick  that I wanted to die  and you didn’t do anything to help me  FUCK YOU  Fuck you for not believing me when I knew that there was something wrong  Fuck you for saying that I’m attention seeking  or that I’m selfish  All I ever cared about was everyone else’s feelings  You made me think that there was just something wrong with me  and because of that  I dated and sought out friendships with people who also didn’t really like me for me  but I thought that it was normal  because of course  if someone didn’t really like me  or thought I was “too much  too sensitive  overly emotional” it was reasonable  I’d been told that my whole life  I really believed  I MUST be the problem  there’s no way that it’s anyone else’s fault  And then you would make me feel even more stupid for choosing to be around people who treated me that way  not recognizing where I learned to deal with that sort of behavior You always make my feelings about yourself  why  When I was sad as a kid or teenager  and couldn’t explain EXACTLY what was wrong you would literally YELL at me and ask why you’re so horrible  The last time that I tried to reach out to you will be the last time that I ever do  When I have a baby  I don’t want you to be there  When I go through a loss  you would be the last person I would call  When my heart is broken  or I need a place to live  I won’t reach out to you  When I graduate with my degrees  I don’t want you there  You couldn’t support me when I needed you to  and you always make my successes about yourself  as if any part of how you raised me is why I am the way that I am today  And it’s not  I’m who I am because of what you and others have put me through in my life  not because of how good of a mother that you are  I was raped by a guy that I really liked  but I couldn’t even tell you  Not only because of how you had always responded to me in the past  but also so as not to confirm you racial hatred  He was the only black man I ever tried to date  and I didn’t want you to be “right” about your horrible nasty racist beliefs  When my best friend died and I had nowhere to go  you charged me RENT  You told me after a couple of months that “it’s been long enough  you need to get over it already ”          WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU  Why can’t you have an ounce of empathy for anyone outside of yourself  How could you hurt me so much  I’m your flesh and blood  your daughter  How is choosing denial better than choosing to be close to me  how is avoidance the answer to everything in your life  I know now that you will never be the mom that I thought you could be  because you choose yourself above all else  and I’m sorry for that I’m sorry that you won’t get to know the amazing woman that I am choosing and working to become  I deserved better  even if you gave your “best”  and both of those things can coexist  you’re just not emotionally mature enough to understand that  I’m sorry that you had a hard life  but that does not discount the fact that I have too  Not everything is about you  I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the daughter that you want me to be  just as much as you’ll never be the mother that I want and need you to be  You’re welcome for being there for you when I was too young to understand that it wasn’t my job  I know you think that I am abandoning you because I stopped being there for you at a certain point  And I’m sorry for that too  Because of you  I know how emotional abandonment feels  and it hurts like a motherfucker  Nobody deserves to feel that way  But no child should be responsible for their parents pain  Thank you for working your ass off to provide for me and making sure that I didn’t turn out to be a fuck up  I know that you tried  I just wish that you could try harder now to heal us I love you mom  please know that  I’ll never stop loving you and wishing that we could have a better relationship  But I’ll never be naïve enough to believe that it can happen  They say time heals everything  but I don’t know if there is healing from this sort of pain  I hope that I can forgive you for my own well being  but I’ll say that it may be the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do Well wishes Your daughter,18690,3687

1871,p6gmaz,0,6,Took my hope  made me suicidal and laughed through all of it  When I was younger I told my step mom that I wanted to write a book about the extreme abuse I went through from my dad cuz I wanted to give other abuse victims hope and I always wished I had at least something like a book in my life that I could relate too She immediately laughed at me because  others had it worse  and she grew up poor and went through even worse things  and I dont even know what pain is She thinks that all my dad did was right  but I always fantasised about having a step mom that would defend and protect me from him so I trusted her   I cried my eyes out in front of her and she laughed at how pathetic I am  Today she was angry because I didnt want to listen what she had to say about my self harm   Usually its   youre stupid  just kill yourself I you really want to  I want to rip my eyes and ears from my body  I cant take this anymore  This life is a nightmare,966,190

1873,p6gbze,0,11,Can Having a N Parent who is obviously verbally abusive give the child Aspergers Autism Spectrum Like Symptoms  Hello everyone  I was just thinking  Could a sheltered child or one that comes from a relative who gives them a life where they are unsure what to do half the time  give off symptoms similar  I knew someone who was diagnosed with Aspergers but had a horrible home life where they were sheltered  couldnt go on dates often or had to be watched so often and stay at home  except maybe sports  but are much better now even though they are still at home Basically  this person gets yelled at for    damned if you do something  damned if you dont  They could get along with people fine but the n parent did not want this at all  They had a social life but it was off so the parent decided to get them tested and claimed they were horrible on tests and hated specific fabrics and certain lights and all of this  And it was untrue  And now they are marked with Aspergers for life even though it is mainly on school records even now when its been a few years since graduation  Im not even sure if the n parent wants them on disability or not  but I know it is coming  I believe that Aspergers like symptoms since toddler days are due to the n parent  It messed with the brain somehow on learning about the world around them  They are a beautiful person once they are away from the n parent  They dont have Aspergers or anything autistic  its just horrible n parenting  They have a great social life  they can get a job  there is nothing stopping them from accomplishing their dreams  But the n parent holds them back and wants them as disabled as possible  Though real Aspergers people can just as well be beautiful in the world as well and function like everyone else  but I hope all of you get what I mean What is your opinion everyone  I hope you all are having a wonderful night     Thank you for reading,1933,345
1874,p6g9uv,0,5,Its like constantly having a shadow following you every moment of your life  My parents are not just abusive and neglectful  They are from a lower middle class background and are generally poor  My mother on top of that is also greedy and penny pinching  for her its all about the money  To explain the extent of this  now that Im an adult I still have huge problems spending money  earned by myself  on even a candy bar  as a non essential expense  to the point of feeling so much guilt that I could literally cry  Arrogant  ill mannered  opinionated  bumptious  selfish  immature people who  would have liked to  but never  could  I brought myself up on my own  mainly through novels that helped me survive  As a result  today Im a severely unstable  depressed adult with a lot of problems  but from a human standpoint I remain far better than my parents  As a result  Ive also approached much better environments than the one I come from My fiancé is a polite  educated person from a upper middle class family  His family members are doctors  lawyers  journalists  all with advanced degrees  all well educated  high achieving  with beautiful homes  lives  pasts and futures And then    there I am  I have serious problems with having proper posture at the dinner table  keeping my elbows down  looking people in the eyes when they talk  I keep hearing my mother tell me how mediocre I am  I cant figure out how to properly relate to his family at dinner because I have never had dinner with both of my parents at the table  and certainly not conversing  at most we argue with the TV on at a crazy volume   I cant say anything about my family  because any smallest hint of what they are really like is met with horror by them  No  my parents did not want any more children  No  my parents are not capable of caring for animals  No  my parents dont go on vacations  they never paid me anything  they dont     they dont  parent  at all These are not things I can say  these are not things I  want  to say  but I think its written all over my face  I definitely hear these things constantly ringing in my head as I realize how my fiancé and I come from completely different worlds  He and his parents   talk    His parents actively   encourage   him  His parents are   interested   in his life  His parents act like parents should act  and I feel so much like a fish out of water  amp  xB Maybe I should just crawl back  and look for someone whose life is as mediocre and sad as mine,2509,439
1875,p6g9mn,0,9,My Mom mailed me a letter pretending to be our neighborhood HOA saying my dad  who died last year and left me his house  would not appreciate how many weeds are in my yard I just need to vent about this somewhere  Ive had the letter for two weeks now and the more I think about it the angrier I am  I doubt there will ever be any evidence to actually link my n Mom to the letter and even if I could somehow prove she did this  it would be pointless to confront her because shed never admit to it  But Im so angry and I  know  it was her  It was far too personal and hurtful for me to believe anyone else could have sent it  I also just went NC with her a little over a month ago and shes been very antagonistic since  Shes been trashing me to other family members  trying to call my boyfriend while hes at work to complain Ive blocked her number  and twice Ive come home to her sitting in her car in front my house So  for background   last year when I was  my dad  divorced from my mom for the past   years  passed away from covid and left me his house  I moved into it at the end of  and still live there now  My mom has not been coping well with my dads death and has been very unkind and unsympathetic since he passed  Ive been withdrawing from her over the past year as a result  which has been making her push at my boundaries more and thats why I recently had to go NC  This was the content of letter I received    And heres a photo of it  https   i imgur com bpvMUs jpg   amp  xB  gt Dear Natalie    gt    gt Please try to keep the front of your property a little more presentable   it is an eyesore and the block is sure that your father would want it that way    gt    gt Stay safe    My Neighborhood  Property Association amp  xB What the fuck  Really what the fuck  WHO SENDS THAT TO SOMEONE   There is no way to read this and not feel that whoever wrote it wanted to personally hurt my feelings  Why even MENTION my dad  No reason other than to make this as low a blow as possible  Why call my yard  an eyesore  instead of citing a fucking community guideline about yard maitnence  I found the phone number for the HOA and left them a message to confirm they didnt send it  but they havent called me back  I know HOAs have rightfully earned their bad reputations but I just really dont believe they did this  First off  theyre called the   My Neighborhood  Property     Owners     Association  not the   My Neighborhood  Property Association   Youd at least think theyd get their own name right when signing a letter they sent   And while its not unheard of for people in my neighborhood to send letters  from the HOA  to their neighbors about petty shit  the older people around here like to get wild sometimes  I just cannot imagine WHO out of my neighbors would send me something so personal and hurtful  Im not saying I wouldnt put it past a neighbor to send a letter to someone and pretend its from the HOA to avoid confrontation but like    this letter is TOO PERSONAL for a fucking random neighbor to send me  This letter was typed up with the only intent being to cause upset  If I had a neighbor that was really so pressed about my front yard youd think they would at least include the names of one or two landscaping companies  I dont really talk to people on my street  Im not rude but Im not going out of my way to be friendly  Who could possibly have so much beef with me after waving hello to each other every few weeks for the past eight months   I just cannot bring myself to believe someone who is nearly a stranger to me would send me something like that  Why would this be anyones first response to weeds    Also  the letter was addressed to me directly with no return address and whoever had sent it went through the trouble of typing my name  amp  address up on a separate piece of computer paper  printing it  cutting it out and using clear tape to attach it to the envelope to avoid handwriting anything  I definitely wouldnt recognize the handwriting of anyone who lives near me but Im sure I could recognize my moms Im just so upset  Every day I think about it I get even more angry  I keep thinking about what my mom intended for me to feel when getting that letter  Because if her plan worked correctly then I would think the way my house looked was something people on the block were talking a lot about  complaining about  to each other and at community meetings  I would think that the everyone in the community thats part of the HOA talked about me and my house at a meeting and decided to send me a really cruel letter  That would make anyone feel alienated and alone and ashamed and hurt  And I really did feel this way when I first read it  Thats really how my mom decided I deserved to feel because I havent been talking to her  Ive just had one of the worst years of my life  Im adjusting to so many new things its making my head spin and Im still grieving the loss of my dad  Why be so unbelievably cruel to your only kid  My mom has always been a narcissist and I usually dont expect much from her but Im so shocked she did this,5163,960
1876,p6g7wz,0,2,Ive had enough Ive had about  arguments  in the last two months  with my mother about how it is unacceptable to emotionally abuse me  She tried to deny it  Then said to get over it including the stuff she said when I was younger  She wasnt physical a lot when I was younger tbh She was rageful when I was younger and went a bit too far with the physical punishment  when she did hit me   Im in my late teens now  not a legal adult   Sometimes she threatens to punch me in my teeth because I get an attitude with her  I told her today that Im not scared anymore and if she hits with too much force then Ill hit back  She said shell  pumble  me if I hit back and I suspect shell beat me terribly  I dont know when this would happen  I suspect when I tell her to not be mean  actually verbally mean and not dramatised  because Im done tolerating her disrespect  Shell threaten me  punch me  and itll be a brawl  Im going back to school in a couple of days and boy am I excited  Should I tell my counselor bc Im getting worried for my safety  What do I even do,1073,210

1883,p6fmgo,0,5,Nmom Might Sabotage My Wedding  This is my first time posting on this subreddit  so I apologize if there are any format issues Im not complying with Ive been raised as a single child by my NMom together with her equally narcissistic sister  my aunt  Their favorite weapon of choice is the silent treatment  where they would go weeks without speaking to me at most was a year or so  It even went to a point where they installed a doorbell in my room and just ring me down for dinner because they refused to speak to me  Anything could trigger this  could be me being loud in the mall  or me not getting good grades  I honestly dont know and for fear of triggering this  I would mostly just spend my time in my room playing RPGs and avoiding a social life They are Chinese  so they often talk in that language knowing full well that I cant understand  but I understand enough that most of the time  they just talk crap behind other people or myself reveling in any bad news befallen to other people Because of this  I would often have intense bouts of rage and I overcompensated with having a bombastic  inflated personality where I needed to be heard and recognized outside my home  Outside at school  I was an extroverted  social person  but indoors I was a recluse in my own home  I sought validation and emotional support from anywhere I could get  It wasnt long till I found myself getting that attention from my juvenile bros  joining a gang  and generally fucking up my life by not going to classes and playing DotA in net cafes   In those places  I actually was somebody  they knew me  and they listened  One night  I lost it one night because my mom refused to give me an allowance because she said I was going to use it to do drugs  I wasnt   It particularly bothered me because that night was one night where I legitimately wanted to go out with another group who invented me to a study session  I begged and pleaded for just enough for fare and a coffee or something  She wouldnt and I couldnt understand why  I tried reasoning with them  saying Ill be back by pm  They just ignored me  watched their TV and talked in Chinese like they usually do  In a few seconds  all of the days spent questioning my reality  having no one to talk to   having my self esteem stomped  always being blamed as a bad kid  them not having any accountability for their lack of emotional maturity  just went rushing through my head all at once and I blacked out  I started destroying the house  breaking glass threw their TV on the ground  I had it with them acknowledging my existence  I was going to be heard one way or another whether it was through violence or not Eventually  the police came and had to sort it out  My mom legitimately wanted me arrested and typical gas lighting  refused to take any accountability  and blamed it all on me and how I was a bad  bad person  She spent all her days following talking to all of my relatives about how much of a punk I was  That act of violence was the perfect evidence on how I lacked respect  and that she was the victim mother of a terrible child   I didnt care anymore  I left soon after when I was   A lot of stuffed happened in between  eventually  my Nmom and Naunt couldnt stand each other and they both left and werent speaking anymore  It took me years to reconcile my emotions  mostly with the help of my now fiance who spent many  many years untangling the sheer fucked interweb of my psyche   Because of her  I managed to somehow salvage any semblance of a relationship with me and my Nmom and Naunt and now I can talk to them civilly  and not go into a burst of rage every time  I have a stable job  good relationships  am out of trouble  and am generally a contributing member of society  Im  now  were going to be married soon  My fiance insists that they are still my parents and that they need to be in my wedding  despite my earnest objections  Ive done my best pleasing them and making sure my mom is included  I still maintain my boundaries Now  fast forward to today  there is a legitimate threat looming once again  After a point of conflict with my mother  asking her to do something for me  reach out to somebody Id be taking as a sponsor for my wedding  she told me to do it myself  I said if you can do this as a favor for me as you are more acquainted  I would be very grateful  I told her that I wanted her emotional support for this as I am really overwhelmed with all these preparations  She still tells me to do it myself  and its not her problem  Now she is ignoring my calls and messages This is bringing up some very bad memories and emotions from my past  I want to move forward but knowing her vindictive persona  there is legitimately a chance where she will to turn up for the wedding and or talk shit to my guests and bad mouth me behind me back  Im not quite sure what tod do now  I want to be a better person  but part of me just wants her gone from my life forever  but I

1885,p6fdxq,0,3,No I’m not babysitting I don’t want to take care of your fucking kid because most likely I’m going to lash out at it  ok    The only way I have been taught to handle children is with physical means  I’m talking screaming  threats  punching  grabbing and squeezing their arm tight  kicking  biting  putting your hand over their mouth  sometimes even nose and mouth  to shut them up  doing things to scare the fuck outta them  denying food  leaving for a few minutes to make them think you have abandoned them and they cry  throwing things at near them  etc  etc  etc  It’s an absolutely horrible way of dealing with kids  I’m well aware  but it’s what I’ve been raised with  If I’m left alone to take care of a kid  I’m pretty sure one or more of those things will end up surfacing  That’s why I don’t wanna babysit lady  it’s not for my own sanity  it’s for the protection of your kid,895,162

1893,p6etul,0,4,I confronted my abusive mom  but she had the grossest response  So today I confronted my abusive mother about her behaviour  I seemingly woke up with some confidence to do what previously seemed impossible  and I guess I finally felt that no relationship after telling the truth is better than a non relationship based on lies Ive read a lot of posts about confronting abusive and narcissistic parents on here so I tried to use a lot of tips  I kept it short and sweet  via WhatsApp so I can see shes read it  full of only truth and plenty of ballsy punch  I tried to expect all the possible outcomes with full awareness that the way she would respond would most likely be what I least expected  and boy was I right  She responded by thanking me for airing my grievances  and then in some weird wording  very unlike her  she went on to say how she doesnt begrudge me for the anger Ive had festering inside me for so long  But that wasnt the creepiest part  She then went on to say that she would always be there for me when I need her  and ended it with a love you xx mummy I swear to god  I almost passed out from disgust  Within that moment all of the I conflict inside my head that I previous had went away  The main reason I was conflicted when it came to my mother is half the time she was severely physically emotionally and verbally abusive  having had put me in the hospital once as a direct result of her physical wrath and later again due to sheer negligence  the doctors were surprised I wasnt dead that time   The other half of the time she was the absolute best mother you could possibly imagine  Loving  affectionate  the whole shabang  Thats what fucked me up the most about her  because I never knew which mom I was gonna get  but I knew the one I wanted existed Anyway  I guess it made me realise that anyone that can respond that way is a full blown weirdo  and the affection was probably just a manipulation  or a way for her to get her fix of love  possibly another way to feel powerful so that we rely on her or she can always have us in her lives  I actually recognise that that affection was false  all a ruse  It was absolutely the grossest thing to read  but she fell right into the trap  and I finally saw her for exactly who she really is  I finally feel free  Thank you  raisedbynarcissists redditers  This channel has been a lifeline  and now I can finally start healing properly,2434,450
1894,p6etmc,0,2,Do your narcs not listen to doctors and make their sicknesses worse  I didn’t realize this was a narcissist behavior until I got to Reddit  I have a narc in my house and she thinks she knows more than the doctor  Or rather  doctors  because she went to multiple doctors thinking there was something wrong with her when there wasn’t  And got numerous tests done  I understand getting a second opinion but she went to three doctors and all they said was to go on a diet and she’d improve tremendously  But either she doesn’t listen or she makes the rest of us go on a diet and doesn’t follow it  She even refuses to get a Covid shot despite the doctors telling her it’s fine  And we’ve tried everything to convince her it’s safe  It’s actually super frustrating when we go to parties and she tells our relatives who work in healthcare that she doesn’t need a shot or that the shot is unsafe I was wondering if anybody else experienced this or they have a narc that’s that stubborn with doctors,998,182

1896,p6ej3p,0,3,I learned a disturbing story about my dad a year ago and I’m still having trouble coping  A little bit of backstory  I’ve finally come to learn that my dad is a narcissist  I’ve dissected enough of my childhood to give him that label  but as a child I never knew what to call it  I know now his abuse was “covert narcissism”  and it’s been difficult to accept as I thought I had a loving  normal relationship with him  Well  for the most part  You all know very well how we’ve been taught to make excuses for our abusers and not hold them accountable for the sake of “family”  Now onto the issue at hand… Over a year ago  I learned a disturbing story about my father  The story was actually conveyed to me by my husband and it’s caused a lot of conflict with everyone all around  It also set me back a lot with my healing…  Here’s what happened My husband had drinks with my dad one night  as at one point they got along  sort of  and my dad basically admitted to being what I would say is a pedophile  The disturbing part is that he said he was asking my dad advice on raising a daughter  and my dad told him that years ago when my sister was  or   this would be his step daughter at the time when he was married to my mom and when I was still a baby  she and I have the same mom but different dads  She is  now   my sister crawled in his bed while my mom was in the shower  and started “exploring herself”  we never got a straight forward explanation as to what she did exactly  right next to him and he didn’t stop her  His explanation was that he was allowing her to be comfortable with her body and didn’t want to shame her  and this “made him feel fatherly and that he was protecting her innocence” by not stopping her  Obviously my husband was in a state of shock and made an excuse to go home  and after informing me  my husband called my mom and told her what he just found out and she had it out with him over the phone  he then made it even worse for himself by admitting that it was “hard for him to control himself when Caity  my sister  would walk around in her underwear all the time as a kid”  Since then my husband and I decided that he would never be around our daughter under any circumstances  I have connected dots and had realizations about my own childhood that have deeply disturbed me and made me question who I thought my father to be  I don’t remember any sexual abuse at all  but I do recall a few things that I now realize weren’t normal… I remember comments my dad made about my body as I was growing up  I remember him not taking me serious when I talked about men making me uncomfortable  I remember him taking pictures of women in public without their consent  I remember him offering me foot or leg massages to soothe “growing pains”  I remember him sharing sexual encounters with me with women from his past  I remember him watching porn on the family tv late at night without knowing I was aware of it… I remember feeling weird about these things growing up but I never brought them up because I thought it was normal  I just brushed it all off because he was my dad  and now I’m struggling with feelings of disgust and confusion with a man that I still somehow feel love for  He is in town and asked me to dinner with him and my brother  and for some fucked up reason I want to see him because it’s been a long time since I saw him last  he lives in another state   My husband told me he wouldn’t keep me from him but when I asked him about meeting with my dad and leaving my daughter home with him after he got off work  he said “I can’t control what you do but I don’t even know why you’d want to see him  I would feel hurt if you went”  I am not mad at my husband by any means and I don’t feel comfortable with my daughter being around my dad at all  but I am having trouble feeling love for and having good memories of someone that has exhibited and admitted to creepy  sexual tendencies with a child  If anyone has any advice on how to cope with this  please feel free to comment  I posted this in another sub but then thought I may benefit from some feedback from this sub even more  Thanks in advance ❤️,4161,809
1897,p6eae1,0,29,Did anyone else have an epiphany when they realized certain little behaviours weren’t normal  For a while  I genuinely thought that all wives hated their husbands  generally speaking  fought with them all the time  talked shit about them to their children  and overall hated their spouses company  Hanging out at friends houses was downright triggering because it actually shocked me to see parents that loved each other and didn’t confide In their kids with their emotional distress  You don’t know how shocked I was to hear that the kind of fights and name calling I see wasn’t normal either  I’ve also officially learned what emotional incest is and holy crap is that an epiphany on its own  I recently shared with a friend that I feel like I barely have privacy at home because my mom tends to interrupt me and walk in on me to ask what I’m doing  Like if I’m reading a book  using headphones wathcing something or about to leave somewhere  if anyone is about to leave somewhere  she delves into some story or whole new conversation to keep them for several minutes or even up to a good hour  Imagine my shock when my friend responds with “yep  classic npd  It always has to be about the narcissist’s thing” and now I’m questioning my whole life,1252,219
1898,p6e2wr,0,4,Anxious Around Money Issues  Consequence of being RbNs  I’m very anxious about money  spending  gift giving and donating  For example  I feel obliged to give gifts  make loans  help rescue people etc  which generally has not gone well  so I get really torn  frozen and paralyzed with indecision  but I’m a lot less comfortable about spending on myself  although I do sometimes  I’ve also been very afraid of homelessness since there were always a lot of homeless in my city  I feel panicky about giving money away if I don’t technically have to  I always thought this was just me  Ive lost a LOT of friends over different ideas about money   but reading the comments on this sub now I think it may have to do with the money issues in my family  dad used it as power over my mom etc   we never gave gifts in our family  we were evicted once  I’m on my own and family resents that etc   I guess it’s from the household volatility  having to “buy” my freedom and dignity  and knowing I can’t rely on any help  Anyone else feel like this,1040,190
1899,p6e1p1,0,2,Ndad   Sounds like a pretty cushy job  Okay  for some context  I live in the middle of nowhere where you need a car to get anywhere  my parents never taught my sisters or me to drive  and they come up with a lot of reasons for me specifically not to learn to drive   I am also not allowed to have a bank account or anything like that  so my options of getting away are very limited  so I try my best to lay low My parents promised they would build my sister a tinyhome on the edge of their property as a high  school graduation present  years ago  but my ndad is too busy taking the golden child to they gym to fufill his promise  My mom then let said older sister get a dog right at the same time she was allowed to get a job  I was automatically the built in dog sitter  as I was attending university online  the only way my parents would let me  and because of that I was always at the house Here is where things get interesting  I thought I would be allowed to get a job once I graduate  as that had a always been the agreement  but  since my sister I working and still doesnt have her house  and my mom is always over at grandmas watching tv  I have been stuck with babysitting the dog all day  but this time I dont have anything like school to keep my brain from melting away  My mom said she was going to pay me   a week  from my sisters money because my mom controls all of the money in the household  for watching the dog  but she hasnt  So here I am  sitting at home alone all day with nothing to do except feel my brain slowly rot as I am not even allowed to leave the living room as that is the only room the dog is allowed in  My ndad came home  asked my sister what she did today  and she told him about work   well you get a point   he said before asking me the same question  I had to tell him that  like usual  I had to watch the dog  and he said  Sounds like a pretty cushy job  I couldnt say anything back  On one had yeah  he is an easy dog  but he would never believe me if I told him I felt like my mind and my grip on reality were melting away because  after two years of staying at home all the time for school  I thought I was going to be able to get out of the house and have a social life all for that to go down the drain for a dog Idk  maybe i am being too sensitive because when I was in middle school  while I was attending an online school because the public school teachers were bullying me  I had to say at home all of the time to raise my younger siblings and similarly had no friends and no one to talk to,2562,516
1900,p6e1jr,0,2,Rants from past few weeks of built up anger   Why can’t I remember any fucking thing  I barely remember my time living with grandma and grandpa  I’ve spent most of my life there and there’s nothing but faint memories  I fucking hate It  Why am I so angry and hate people talking to me  It’s because of grandpa beating the living dog shut out of me and screaming at me for any fucking thing  And it was just the children of my mother  My younger cousin got treated like he was royalty  and he still is  He too is autistic so idk if he understands how blessed he is and I won’t hold that against him  When I got diagnosed with Autism  my grandfather mocking me gotten worse  he’s said my brain is fried up like fish and pull my hair and said how my hair twisted up looks ugly  he is half Korean and had very wavy hair   whenever I was clearly sick he’d tell me to shut up and lock me in the dark in my room  when I was younger I would occasionally piss the bed  I had to get out and tell my grandma  In order to stop me from doing that my grandpa got a rope and tied my ankle to the head of the bead  That’s not even the worse of it  he’s let my siblings and uncle do some terrible things to me  not even my grandma would stop them  CPS was contacted twice  once through my mom and the other when I written a letter to my substitute teacher in third grade  When my family lied to that dumbass agent who clearly didn’t like me  they told me that if I told my feelings I’d never see any of them again  My brother told me “feelings are for white people” and to suck it all up  I don’t understand  so much more happened throughout my childhood why don’t I remember  I remember some things so vividly but other memories are so faint  I always assumed it was because I was darker compared to everyone else in my family    What does sibling love even feel like  My brothers hate me and just as much as I hate them  They’re both against me and it’s just me  the middle child and only girl in this fucked up family with my problems always being invalidated  Since everyone had a worse childhood than me  Maybe they’re right idk  Maybe I should act like I don’t have any problems in life  Oh wait I’ve been doing that all my life an and now I have everyone deep down  Damn I wish I had a job I’m tired of family    I tell myself bad things about my dad so I can stop expecting good things out of him  I know  I know I tried my very best not to fit into that average black kid stereotype but tough shit for me I fit in perfectly with it  The next generation of baby mamas with every daddy issue out there  I don’t see myself with my ideal future  I probably said this before but I blame my dad for everything that went wrong in my life so to hell with him     Does he try  Probably not probably whenever I call him he gives me every excuse in the book just to shut me up for the next couple of months  He broke mamas heart  she soon found out she had MS soon after and became suicidal  He left her like this and pretended not to notice  Honestly half of my family is telling me to have nothing to do with him and the other half is to have a relationship  I’m torn between the two because I don’t want to fill the stereotype of the average black kid not having a dad  On the other hand I don’t want to end up like my older brother   heart broken  cold  angry and disappointed  Damn that lying man  Every time we call it’s a whole new “promise” saying “I’ll send you money” or “I’ll come visit you” mf can’t even come see me in person  he sent Stephon  my half brother  or his wife and daughter to do it  I hate my fucking life and I feel like having a relationship with both my parents would make it right  I feel like that’s how I would’ve had a normal life and I feel like I’ll forever blame my dad for all my problems no matter what he says or do  You know what who cares  He has his own family  grown ass children that he relies on to take care of me including his own wife  so let me not  I’ve always been a burden to everyone throughout my life so why not make it easier for some people  Asswipe of a father  Why have kids if you not gonna take care of them  mans was living a double life  TWICE      I want to form a good relationship with my stepdad but even though he’s known me more than I ever known he was my stepdad he’s always been a stranger to me  he’s just…been there  I recall when I was younger I always wanted him to pick me up from school  I’m glad he knew his place though and never decided to lay hands on someone else’s child but that’s odd to me  No I don’t want him to beat me but does he even consider me family  Not just family but family family and not just another mouth he feels the need to feed  What is there to even talk about between us  To him I’m just that American kid that lacks “common sense” and I think that’s all I’ll ever be in the eyes of a man  A vulnerable girl that doesn’t think and can only be used for working around the house  Anyways THE CULTURE BARRIER IS MAD ANNOYING   Let me just describe him in my viewpoint He’s a pathetic but smart man  Whenever he’s in the wrong he finds a way to pin it on someone else  he’s a pathetic child that throws a tantrum when things don’t go his way  and he get overly aggressive when someone says otherwise with him  honestly bro why are you yelling I’m right here trying to have a decent conversation with you  JUST BECAUSE IM ONLY  DOESNT MEAN I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING  Hell  one time I told him children don’t fix marriages and he told me to shut up I don’t know anything about relationships  Firstly where do you think o got that quote from  Far from beyond my ass  I heard it from people who thought the same thing you did and learned the hard way it was false  Thought I’m assuming that’s why you had Joshua which is very sad in my opinion if that’s the case  you already abuse the boy enough physically   Also how is this man able to go to college and fully study the things that he studies without taking child psychology   If he did take it it would literally save my half brother’s ass and him the constant frustration do the both of you a favor before he ends up like Jaden  hating the absolute dog shit out of his own father,6225,1228
1901,p6dvql,0,7,Anyone have PTSD from their Nparent  Its been about  years since I went no contact with my Nmother  She was just horrible to me since my earliest memories as a child   I was like a puppet for her to live a life through me that I didnt want for myself  Granted as a kid I didnt know better and then around high school I really started to push back on things I wanted to do and I cant even recall how many times I heard her tell me she hated me  I have major  mommy issues  I would essentially cling not in a weird or uncomfortable way to my friends mothers because I never knew what it felt like to have that mother daughter bond like a lot of those close to me had  Its hard for me now even seeing those around me close to their mothers  My breaking point in life was when she went above and beyond to try and manipulate me to hate my dad  My parents were having relationship issues  due to her of course  that she was trying to spin the fault on my dad as to why they were headed to divorce  well come to find out she was having an affair and I caught her  I was  t the time this all happened but still was hard to watch my parents divorce   I was there by my dads side as she did everything she could to hurt him and myself  I have a husband and two small kids that I also protect from her  She constantly pleads and begs online to people how she misses them and texts me periodically wanting to  mend  our relationship Its days like today where I am in a career field I hate that I am slowly working to get out of that I have anxiety and resentment towards her   Things my boss will say to me remind me of things my mother would say to me    or even my husband at times will say things that just hit a trigger in me  I just fall apart and I use to be able to hold myself together better but it has caught up to me  I plan on trying to find a counselor soon to talk with but I also find it helpful to come over to reddit when I know I am not alone in this battle  Sorry for the long post  I could go into more detail on so much but I tried to keep it short,2072,421
1902,p6dv9j,0,1,Doubt I find myself doubting myself all  The  Time  I’m not sure if it’s just a product of narc parenting but I have like no confidence because it’s so hard to know what narcs are really thinking and it can make me question if they are narcs at all sometimes at least in my experience and it’s maddening  There are even times where I question my own behavior and if I’m the narc  It’s a constant battle in my head and the cognitive dissonance is always there  I just want the truth but would I be going through all this if my parent was normal  A large part of my doubt comes from me tho  every time my mom says a hurtful thing I forget it very easily as a trauma response  I’m assuming and because it’s so often and I can’t remember when asked to bring up narc behavior that I deal with and end up feeling stupid for standing up for myself in the first place  This is SO hard to understand  The more I learn about it  the more I understand  it honestly just leaves me with even more questions  It’s all so fucking much information that it can be very overwhelming and intimidating for me  It makes me want to just act like everything’s normal and forget about it but I know that’s what she wants,1197,230
1903,p6du54,0,2,Anyone elses nparents gaslight themselves into exacerbating their narcissism  Perhapss gaslight isnt the best word  but heres an example of my nfather  the biggest piece of shit Ive ever had the displeasure of meeting  This is the cycle we deal with   Nfather needs everything done his way exactly  If not  its wrong and the other person is incompetent and needs to be yelled at  berated  and insulted until they do better   Nfather  due to being an narcissist  thinks hes the only person that knows how to do anything  AKA things done his way   He wont let anyone else take upon his tasks or duties because he doesnt trust them to do a good job  This furthers his narcissism   Nfather  due to being a narcissist  wont teach others  because any mistake they make is inexcusable and a headache to him   Nfather is overloaded with tasks  complains hes the only one who does anything and the only one who isnt stupid or lazy   Saying anything against that point   well I do XYZ and you dont know how to do ABC   will cause him to throw a tantrum about all the things he does for the house  As a result  no one says anything  knowing how it will end  so he thinks hes always in the right   And every time someone makes a mistake  no matter HOW tiny or inconsequential  hell angrily point it out and start yelling  But hes given all the excuses and chances for his own mistakes  because of course  hes competent and unlike us  his mistakes dont define him Anyone else have to endure something similar,1528,266
1904,p6dtqi,0,7,Feeling guilty going NC through loss My grandpa passed away yesterday and I requested to stay out of group messages with my sibling and cousins  I can’t help feeling guilty that I’m not there for my nparents who I’ve been NC with  But I don’t think being there and reestablishing contact would be healthy for me Am I a bad person for holding my boundaries through loss  Logical thinking is telling me it’s okay and if a friend were in this position  I would advise them to maintain distance    But I still feel so guilty and just need to hear if from people who get it,573,105
1905,p6dkgt,0,2,NMom is acting like a toddler because my sister enforced her boundaries   Rant Vent  TW  Mentions of Suicide Attempt So the background  My sister Elisabeth and her best friend from school went to two different but close universities  Her friend  who has been through a lot with her own NDad  wasnt coping well at the beginning of this academic year  didnt tell anyone how bad things were getting for her and tried to kill herself  She damn near did too  Thank God for her flatmates finding her in time Naturally Elisabeth was extremely distressed by this and now that her friend has got the help she needs and is doing better it isnt something that she likes to talk about  Elisabeth is currently visiting the rents during her summer break from university  Im two hundred miles away at home and shes telling me this via WhatsApp Yesterday Elisabeth had been out with that friend and NMom picked her up to take her back  During the car journey she decides its the perfect time to speculate about why Elisabeths friend tried to kill herself  Naturally my sister became increasingly upset by this  This annoyed NMom who told her that  paraphrasing   like it or not Im your Mother  I can talk about whatever I want  I was really upset too because Im friends with her mother and you are so rude for not wanting to talk about this with me  She then tries to guilt trip my sister  Saying that she doesnt understand people who wont talk about their feelings and that she talks about her feelings because she cares about people Elisabeth knows shes trying to guilt her and doesnt respond  NMom eventually tries to act like it didnt happen Then today she apologises for her behaviour and then demands an apology from Elisabeth  To which Elisabeth basically says  for what  I didnt do anything   NMom then throws a massive tantrum  goes to her room to bawl and still hasnt come out seven hours later Elisabeth is now feeling guilty  My blood is boiling  I am absolutely furious and I want to apparate there and slap NMom  Failing that  I want to call my NMom and scream at her for her behaviour  I know thats an all caps Bad Idea though Needed to vent  Just when Im convincing myself that maybe she isnt that bad she pulls this crap  Lord give me strength,2281,393
1906,p6dduv,0,8,Continuing to find out that my Nmom has caused me some SERIOUS health problems as I venture into adulthood Just going to list off the main issues   I had UTIs very often as a child because she wouldnt let me go to the bathroom when I needed to  They were never treated until adulthood  and I now have chronic urethral pain nearly every time I pee  even when I have no infection  I now have a life long chronic illness called Interstitial Cystitis because she wouldnt let me go to the bathroom    I had hip dysplasia as a baby and she never put me in my brace  My hips now dislocate at random times  and its very painful    I had OCD as a child and she used that to her advantage  triggering me on purpose with numerous counting games and forcing me to be anxious about pointless things because they were a trigger for me  I have minor OCD as an adult    Shes abused me to the point of having CPTSD  and many other mental issues  I dont feel the need to elaborate on this one    I had a binge eating disorder for a long time in my teen years that I could only trace back to my Nmom not feeding me for days as a child  limiting my water intake  etc  I would eat massive amounts of food when it was made clear to me that she didnt care anymore  and would end up getting sick from it all of the time My future is what I make of it  but when I start to wonder  why  Im acting out in a certain way that doesnt make sense  I can generally trace it back to my living hell of a childhood that was caused solely by her  and the enablers around her  I dont feel bad for myself anymore  but I do need to remind myself that Im not crazy at times  and then correct my previously learned trauma reaction behavior  Its a slow process,1748,336
1907,p6das9,0,7,How do you avoid getting sucked into arguments that Nparents do their most to start with you  Any tips would be appreciated by not only me but anyone else who comes across this post  ♡Todays storytime in context to this question  Ive only just learnt of why its important to not let ourselves get sucked into these arguments with narcissists as we know youll never  win  any arguments  discussions or disagreements with them  Im currently practicing how to do this  but its really hard  Today tested me  I was stuck in the car with her as she was driving me back from my hospital appointment  And I was telling her about my new health flare up  I had to tell her as it changes my diet and lifestyle significantly and she tends to buy the groceries most of the time during Covid times currently  though I buy the stuff I need for myself later if I see she doesnt  In the ride back  she basically got all superior and busted out her  everything youre saying is invalid and wrong  youre stupid and young  Im right and all the reasons Im saying for why your health flared up is   correct even though Im not a doctor  card on me I couldnt help but defend myself  but then I knew the mistake I made in my head once I did say my defence  Because it fueled her sadism  it fueled her by feeding off my emotional defensive reaction  Every time I defended myself  she just snapped back with  URGH YOU ALWAYS LIKE TO ARGUE   She sounds like a rude teenager  But thats the ONLY defence she has any time I say anything EVERY time she wants to start an argument with me  Of course  she gaslights the blame onto me even though she KNOWS what shes doing  I think if I do need to respond whenever she tries to start an argument with me  I just need to either not respond  even though I want to defend myself so bad or scream at her   or Ill just respond as emotionless and little as possible  like grey rocking  Because I know if I show even a LITTLE emotion in what I say  it just feeds her for some reason  I dont get why  Its the one thing I dont get about narcissists  Because emotions are interesting reactions to them  Anyway this   mins car ride back felt like a whole hour  I realised that I wasnt going to  win  once she started to keep screaming nagging nonsense and showing off her knowledge about the reasons why my health flared up and criticising every little thing Im doing thats causing it just to try manipulate and gaslight me into believing what shes saying  It was then that I just stopped talking  I stopped talking because I knew there is literally nothing I can do or say that will convince her  a narcissist  to actually LISTEN and care about what I have to say for once  And this was whilst she was still screaming at me whilst driving  what a reckless driver  I just rolled the window down and started to do subtle deep breaths to calm myself down and bring any sliver of peace I could within that car ride    And this is why I HATE car rides with only her  She will always use it to her narcissistic advantage because she knows I cant escape  And today  I honestly did just want to jump out the car  or walk out at a stop light back home  But I held back because we still live together currently so it would be a bad idea  But wow car rides with only her are so incredibly suffocating One thing I do know for sure  Im not letting her drive me to and back from University once term starts next month  Thats like willingly diving into a pool of poison,3520,651
1909,p6d9nr,0,2,leaving home was the best thing i did for myself  My relationship with my nmom has gotten so much better  And I dont mean I moved an hour away  I moved an entire state away with  hours of distance between us  Shes a cool person I just realized we dont do well living together  Has anyone else had this experience,315,61

1911,p6d0of,0,2,So uncomfortable with ndad telling me I am beautiful Ughhhh so gross  He just called me out of the blue to say hes so glad I am  naturally beautiful   I said it was weird and he laughed and said it isnt  He was apparently watching a commercial for cosmetic surgery and thought to call me and tell me hes glad I dont need any What the f  I was so caught off guard I didnt tell him it made me feel uncomfortable  I thought he was calling about a money thing we talked about earlier  He doesnt usually do this  its been awhile since hes commented on me physically like that  But he has objectified me plenty of times  Nothing sexually explicit  though he talks like that about women on tv And now I have to deal with these feelings of being disrespected and owned by him  I was having a normal nice day and now I have to deal with this  Im so mad  Im too intimidated by him to tell him how I feel  Even if I werent  that conversation would never go the way I needed it to In conclusion  UGHHHH GROSSSSS ALKSDJF LAIJF OAIJFAL KSJNJ ALKJFH IJF LAKSJF LAKJF LKAJFASD  Thanks for listening,1102,196
1912,p6com4,0,3,My parents are abandoning me in my darkest of times Everything I care about was stolen from a u haul recently  All my clothes and everything  Both my parents are the type where they help me a lot financially  and I used to feel they would help me emotionally and everything  but not anymore  Right now I’m sitting in my apartment with the few things I have left and my mom isn’t answering her phone  She was supposed to take me out to eat and buy me a new desk to help me to feel better about everything  but the time has long since past  She was also supposed to meet me today to make me feel better about the recent abuse my father has been dealing to me  knowing he’s the one I always looked to as a role model before and now that’s shattered  I realized both of them must have attracted each other because they have similar toxic qualities  Anyways this is also after this past weekend where she ignored me for two days straight while in “training”  Aka drinking and touring around New York City  when I was needing to talk to her for five minutes to ask her to call the detective and also tell her the u haul workers helped themselves to some of the few belongings I had left in the truck   They got the truck back after police found it abandoned  I never thought life could get this low  How does one find purpose and meaning in life without their parents  or the knowledge they’re both evil and sick  It’s almost like they’re working together secretly to drive me over the edge  I’m not prepared or capable of dealing with this  I appreciate any words of advice,1585,295
1913,p6co1c,0,13,Why were seen as  rude  by other people when we stand up for ourselves I made a sample of how a conversation with my mother went   This was within the last few years  so Id be in my late s and had been living on my own and generally had a better frame of reference for things   The one thing that struck me was that I essentially had to be  rude   by normal standards  in order to actually get anything through her head   Of course then shed huff about how I didnt have to be so rude to her all the time  amp  xB So the conversation  she was venting about some marital issues which honestly werent really my business in the first place   And it was going on just way too long  a couple hours  and I was getting stressed out to the point where I needed to stop a while ago and was having trouble not showing it  amp  xB Me  Hey  this is really starting to get to me Her  Oh  I know  this is such a stressful situation  lt keeps talking gt Me  This is a bit much  can we take a break Her  Yeah it is a lot to deal with  isnt it    lt keeps talking gt Me  Ok  this is too much  I need a break Her  Its so hard to deal with all this stuff other people are doing   Have you tried some relaxation techniques   lt keeps talking gt Me  This is too much  I need you to stop following me around talking about this Her  Geez you dont have to be so rude about it   I said wed take a break whenever you needed  you could have just asked  amp  xB If I point out that I did ask  multiple times  shell just say that I wasnt clear and I need to learn to be clearer rather than be rude   But it can be hard for outside people to understand when they only see the last part   In most normal relationships it would be rude to act like that   But also in a normal  healthy relationship the other person would have backed off with the softer request   Narcissists  and other general pushy assholes  will force you to be direct to the point that would normally be rude and then take offense and act as though that was the first thing you said,2069,389
