For the time I saw my dad as he truly is and that he will never acknowledge my heartache and the abuse I and my siblings suffered at his hands. Despite this, I still can't shake this stupid, learned behavior that I need to consider my dad's feelings while he can walk all over mine. 

My letter outlined, with specific examples, the negative impacts on my life he's had. I was homeless at 17 and he didn't once think to reach out and see how I was doing or offer to help. 3 out of 4 of his kids have now decided to go no contact with him. 

Anyways this was his response:

nothing_to_be,

It is very difficult to respond to your letter.  Your letter covers two decades of heartache that I was unaware of, and has me grieving the loss of our relationship that never was.

The pain described in your letter and your decision to go no contact leaves me deeply saddened. Especially now… as you said there are many things left unspoken between us.

Your letter was heartfelt, well written and triggers a sense hopelessness in me. With so much content to process all I can say right now is I love you nothing_to_be.

We live in difficult times that are hard to navigate. The world today is so much different than it was in the recent past. All this is driving a need within me to reconnect with God. Who unfortunately, I’ve been running from since my darkest years that culminated in divorce from your mom.

In your letter you describe your experiences and memories, those  belong to you and you alone.  That’s how your memories feel to you, that’s how you remember them. Also in your memories you presume to know my thoughts. Those don’t belong to you, you can’t possibly know my inner thoughts and motivations. I would go so far as to say you don’t really know me.

The absence of hate isn’t love nothing_to_be, I wish things could be different between you and me. Maybe we could talk about it someday. You have had a long time to consider this and have your reasons. I respect your request for autonomy. So, until my heart is right with God and He influences my path, I will need time before I can willingly consider action that further contributes to the sadness and vulnerability I feel today.

I love you nothing_to_be,

I went no contact for a number of reasons. 

Major reasons:

• My mom had me at 15 and tricked into signing over guardianship to my grandparents. 

• I didn't meet my biological dad until I was 20 because my grandparents threatened to literally kill him. They held him at gun point. For 20 years my grandparents said he was a consistent drug addict and that he cheated on my mom. He wasn't. He is very stable, only smoked pot here and there through high-school. Dad was a cop who suspected my mom was being sexually abused by grandpa, which she was. I believe this is why they actually ran him out of town. 

• I always confided in my grandma as a child about my step dad abusing me. My grandma lied to everyone and told my mom nothing was happening despite my constant confessions of abuse. I was abused for 5 years. 3-8. When I was a teen, my grandma gave my mom constant advice for my ""acting out"". Resulted in a lot of beatings and different medications that led to a drug problem. Grandma was playing both sides of the field by telling my mom I was a rebellious teen and telling me that my mom didn't love me and that she was always there for me to act on my behalf. Learned all of this at 20 after I went no contact after meeting my dad. My mom also went no contact and we got closer... despite her being a terrible mother for years. That's another post for another day. 

• 3 months after having 0 contact, I started having terrible nightmares of abuse that happened before I was 4 or 5. I was wetting the bed and waking up screaming. I had such an abusive childhood that I blocked so much out for years. Went to therapy and added another abuser to list. 

There is honestly so much more and I feel like I could type all day. I just wanted to give a little background.

I'm having what feels like nightmares because in my dream I'm talking with my grandparents and either defending my experience or my mom's. It's like it's in the future and I know she is narcissist but I've given her another chance? We talk about the years I didn't talk to her and then we just carry on? I feel like I'm going crazy. Last night I dreamed that my grandma had convinced me that I was wrong about her being a narc and I missed time with her. It was like all of the love bombing wasn't love bombing and it was real? Like I woke up thinking ""what if she really wasn't that bad and I've cut out the only person that ever cared for me growing up?"" I've been stuck on the couch all day with racing thoughts. My only way to cope with this kind of thinking is to remember every little fucked up thing she's ever done.

I asked her multiple times to talk with my siblings, she said yes, which later turned into her not wanting to because ""It makes her anxiety act up to get involved in drama."" I told her I felt like if I were to become so bad mental health wise and end my life (I don't have these thoughts, just a hypothetical) that nobody would know how it got to be that bad.

Shortly after their separation, my ndad found a woman who was pretty nice at first. Since I was only 13 and my mother had moved out of state with her new ""husband,"" I latched onto my new stepmom and was quite happy to have a ""mom"" figure to look up to. She didn't even seem to be a narc at first, though being with my ndad soon changed that. I think it's called fleas, and both my nmom and now nstep mom have them, since they exhibit traits similar to the way my ndad has always been, but only after spending enough time around him.
   So, my ndad came into my room one day, right at the start of the Covid waves, last year, late winter, early spring. He screamed at me and my so for being lazy, and preceded to tell me he'll be taking my door off the hinges to give me a reason to come out of my room. This was because me and my so were still relaxing at noon on a Friday (our school only went Mon-Thurs), and were not yet up and cleaning his house. 
   I still don't know what in me made me do it, but after years of putting up with him barging in or beating down my door to scream at me, that day I'd finally had enough, and I asked my so if I could stay at his grandparents house for a few weeks. 
   Though my nmom turned my life upside down from there, my nstep mom was the sole supportive family member, and had told me the whole, ""if that's what you think is best for you, then go ahead,"" line. So a year passed with me stuck at nmom's until I'm almost 18, (very long story) before moving back in with my so, where I've spent the past 10ish months. 
  The surprising thing is, though no one saw a problem with me not doing my senior year at my nmom's house, as soon as I'd moved back with my so, my whole family just had to tell me how badly I'd failed them for not sticking with school and, ""just hunkering down and getting it done."" I quickly got my stuff together though, getting my drivers license and Ged within the first few months, though my nfamily all had the same sentiment of ""a GED isn't nearly as good as a diploma, how are you supposed to get into college with that?""
   Of all the family members disappointed in me, I was only surprised by one. Nstep mom tried to be ""nice,"" while telling me every other sentance how much my little sister, (a severely autistic 15 year old) misses me, and how I should come ""visit"" her on an all expense paid ""vacation.""
Since my nstep mom used to understand how much stress and anxiety my family gives me, I was shocked when she blew up on me, and acted offended that I wouldn't accept her generous request.
   That happened a few months ago, and at about the same time she had sown the seeds for the title... yes I am getting there, but it makes no sense out of context....
   So my nstep mom and my ndad are living in ndad's home city, a day's drive from where I live, and I have no vehicle. Nstep mom came from where I'm living now, so she's been quite out of her element in ndad's big city, and, while we spoke on the phone, would make it clear she was unhappy there. She had no friends or family there, and deep down always wanted a horse, yes, a horse. Now, that wouldn't be a problem, except the fact that my ndad can't care for ANY animal, let alone children...
  
  Anyways, during a phone call with nstep mom, she had asked me how I'd feel if her and my dad had a baby. Keep in mind, I'm 18 and my father has ALWAYS treated me like a burden, not to mention told me that I'll be caring for ""the little r*tard"" (yes both my parents have always called my little sister that, I grew up thinking it was normal). So when my nstep mom said that, I had no clue what to say, and first stuttered out something like, "" sure, that'd be nice.""
I was in such deep shock I couldn't think, and I think 3 weeks passed before I texted her again.
  And once I did, she was even worse than before. She tried hard to guilt trip me about my sister, telling me how much she missed me, how she'd been asking for me, and how hard it is to take care of her every other week. Don't get me wrong, I do miss my sister too and really want to see her, but putting pressure on me to come visit her on everyone else's time, while I'm trying to get a job and save for a car... it just cane across as selfish, and after the baby thing...
   So I sent her a long paragraph explaining that ""this is the reason we haven't spoken in weeks. You put alot of stress on me and I can't really handle it right now.""
   It honestly broke my heart the way she responded; she basically went on a long tangent about how SHE just wanted me to come and have a nice ""vacation,"" and how she wouldn't be offering me a vacation like this again.""
  I then reiterated that helping with my little sister and jumping through the families hoops is anything but a vacation, and for her to please stop offering it. I also, heaven forbid, mention something about how I don't have a support system down there and need to focus on getting support.
  All of this caused my nstep mom to seethe with rage, and she merely responded, ""I see.""
  
Me: Sorry I just dont like not telling people what going on in my head, since it is such a mess, and I know if my dad one half of what my life is he wouldn't accept it.
   (No I'm not a stripper, I just have a trans bf...)

Nstep mom: All I have to say is if you have to hide your life, you aren't doing it right. Live a life you are proud to share with everyone. And last thing, a job or college aren't the only paths to success, but they are the only options to survive. Don't make a fool out of yourself trying to prove everyone wrong.  And lastly, dont worry I wont be a support system for you anymore since it seems I never was. Good luck on your own, maybe (so's dead name) will be able to help you adult. I'm out.

Me: I mean, I have to hide it from the abusers I'm related to  so there's not much I can do there, aside from that I am proud of my life. And of course jobs are necessary, no sh*t  but I can't hack a full time right now and that's what's important. And what the f*ck are you talking about ""you've never been a support system,"" I mean that line speaks for itself. You were a good support system, but now you've become like my father and and I don't even know, you're thinking this is somehow an attack on you. And yeah, my boyfriend (so's real name) has made it easier and greatly helped me learn how to adult, as you used to before you were all full of obligations for me. I hope you are happy with my father, but after youimplied that I could stay with him for 6-9 months, I realized you're in a completely different headspace.

   After that, she sent a slightly shorter text about all the obligations of life, basically saying ""I'm sorry you can't handle having obligations,"" though what effing obligations is she talking about? I'm obligated to drop what I'm doing and help her care for my little sis AND her baby...

A bit of back story my Nsister is seriously a terrible mother. She speaks to her kids like they are grown men, cussing at them telling them they are stupid, ungrateful, and I’ve heard from my mom at times possibly physically abusive. When anyone tries to talk to my sister about her terrible ass behavior she lashes out, cussed out, says how terrible we are. I think she is mentally disturbed and chooses to be a terrible person.

So, after leeching and living off my mom for years, my sister finally was able to get her own place. Bad thing is this leaves her to do all her damage on the kids such as cussing them out etc. she leaves my 14 year old niece to watch the younger siblings and take care of household duties. 

My niece this week sent me a really heart breaking message about how she is depressed, she’s never known love, her only escape is school, and that this is because of all the terrible things her mother has said to her. When I talked to her on the phone she started breaking down crying and said she’d rather be homeless than live with her mother. 

What’s worst about all of this is that she is going through the same things I went through as a child. And it is the worst in the world to hear that.

My parents divorced 6 years ago (to be precise 2015 when I was 10). I supposed to live with my mother but shortly after that my mom remarried, so I lived with my dad because I'm not comfortable living with a stranger (my stepdad). It was all going fine until 3 years later. My dad decides to remarry too and yeah I got myself another step parents (mother). My stepmom was really nice to me at first but not even within 4 months she revealed her true colors. My stepmom and my dad argue thousand times everyday for months because she feels unfair that my dad and her has to take care of me fully meanwhile my real mom and my stepdad is enjoying their lives. While my dad try to keep calm and hide the fact about his quarell with my stepmom from me , my stepmom always confront me f2f telling me I should leave the house and live with my real mom.

At first I ignored her keep living in my house for few months but my dad and my stepmom relation is getting worse, my stepmom leaves house few times (which I find not bad for me, but my dad always looks depressed whenever it happens so I feel really bad for my dad) so I decided to contact my mom. I transferred to another school and start living with my real mother and stepdad.

I thought it's gonna be over and everyone's happy. But no. Same thing happened again just with a different family. My stepdad doesn't approve to take care of me and my stepdad was a bit of abusive.

For my college living situation, my Ndad made me manage his house and has pressured me into finding roommates so they could pay him rent. He wasn't satisfied with how fast I found roommates so he ended up finding them all for me, moving in whoever he could. 

He's currently in the process of evicting my roommate because he hasn't been paying rent. He is also suing him for the rent. 

I traveled for a month this summer without giving my dad any notice because when I brought up the idea to him he got super mad and said I wasn't allowed to go (I'm 20). 

When I got back home, my dad blamed me for my roommate still living in the house. He said since I wasn't there to ""establish my presence"" and let in a sheriff to officially evict him, it is entirely my fault. 

My dad refuses to communicate with my roommate until he pays rent. I'm supposed to be the messenger between them but since my dad is, well, an Ndad he never has anything formative to say to him. I'm kinda lost on what to do. 

Since I've been gone, my roommate got hooked on hard drugs and is refusing to leave the house because he wants to get back at my dad for suing him. He doesn't clean up after himself, sleeps on the couch, tracks dirt everywhere, has a pitbull he doesn't take care of, etc. This has made my living situation total shit. I'm talking to him and trying to communicate that we need him to leave, and it seems like he gets the message at first but he always ends up raging about my dad. Because of this, I have no idea if he plans to leave or not. When I tell my dad what he says, he rages at me about how it's all my fault that he's still living there. 


I feel very unsafe with this roommate. He keeps a bat by the front door and I think he wants to hurt my dad. He lives in the living room and leaves messes everywhere so it's just really unpleasant to walk around in my own home. there's a 50/50 chance that he will move out but in the meantime he's there and it sucks. I'm considering moving out but I know my dad will get even more mad at me for abandoning the familys house and not pushing my roommate to leave on a daily basis. I am still in college and paying my car insurance, registration, class fees, wifi, utilities, vet bills. I don't feel prepared to move out on my own. Additionally if I do move out there is no way my dad would be willing to help me with college fees, since moving out would be ""abandoning my family"". 

I'm lost on what to do. On one hand I feel unsafe, but on the other hand I will struggle so much if I move out.

Recently, a truly ridiculous story happened; my nmom instructed her employee to spy on me and my friend by reading our private conversation. I called this very employee 'a pedophile' and everyone got offended by what I wrote in my private messages. The guy I called a pedo was engaged by then in a sexual relationship with a seventeen year old being thirty five himself and is addicted to ADBL (adult baby/diaper lover) pornography. As you can see, I was entitled to have this sort of opinion and I never had any intention to speak up publicly on this topic.

My mother put me trough some usual narcissistic hell I'm already kind of used to, stalking and threatening included. But it's not what the post is about.

When I learned more about how narcissistic families work, I began to feel dissapointed by what father DIDN'T do when I lived with them. He never stood up for me. He did nothing when my mother slapped me in the face. He did nothing when she gaslighted me, he did nothing when she called me a whore, he did nothing when she made massive argument over nothing and then treated me like I was invisible for weeks and refused to even talk to me.

And now he said, that it was his job as an employer to protect his employee that felt offended by what he read in a private convo he was not entitled to. My enabling father who never protected me from my mother, now protects a perverted psycho, who read my private conversation without permission. 

I feel betrayed. It's devastating to realize that after all these years my parents chose some creepy guy that validated my privacy over their daughter.

So my parents got divorced when I was young and both got remarried later in life. My dad remarried to a woman who later made my life hell. 

When I was 17 I was sent to live with my dad full time. So all my clothes and most of my belongings came with me. 

Over time I noticed certain items went missing. My mum had bought me lacy underwear (“It doesn’t matter if no one will see them it’s nice to feel nice”) and they disappeared. I had a vibrator I’d bought by just walking into a shop that went missing. My mum knew about it. She was unsure at first so talked to her former nurse friend who said it was a brilliant idea and it was good I was being safe in exploring myself. 

For my 17th my dad took me clothes shopping to update my wardrobe. There was a sale at an underwear store. It was cheaper to buy a bra with a matching g string than just the bra so I ended up with two g strings I never planned on wearing. 

She went through my drawers and threw out anything she didn’t approve of. 

Any condoms I brought home from school she found went out. 

Mind you I wasn’t having sex. I didn’t have a partner. And my dad once walked in a friend and I timing how long a condom blown up like a balloon and rubbed on our hair would stick to the roof for. We thought he left the room out of embarrassment. He was actually going for to laugh himself silly.

It's like I'm suddenly realizing and understanding how deeply messed up I was treated as a child and even now as an adult (I'm only 24). I have current health issues and I spoke to my doctor about this and she said I can even tell my parents it's doctor's orders to take a break from them for at least 8 weeks (and that what I have isn't just PTSD from my childhood but it is just considered ongoing psychological abuse at this point). I just really need some advice on how to do so. My parents currently help me financially by letting me remain on their health insurance (this is a major one for me due to having health issues and I know paying for my own insurance would leave me with higher copays for medications in addition to paying for the insurance itself, and my job doesn't offer insurance plans with any decent mental health coverage), paying for my car insurance (the car is paid off), and I am still on their phone plan. I do live on my own and pay for my apartment and bills associated with it and just daily living expenses on my own. I've debated trying to go low contact or very low contact, but I don't even know how to say that without my parents flipping their lids. It's mostly my mom, it's just nonstop expecting I speak to her on the phone at least 3 times a day and when I don't I have to explain myself as to why we didn't talk. I get guilt-tripped constantly with nonstop gaslighting. All my mom does is nonstop call me to rant and basically suck all emotional energy I have, and I've been grey-rocking her nonstop which just makes her say things to upset me and try to get me to interact and fly off the handle at her (which then turns around to me being the liar, being manipulative, putting words in her mouth she never said, etc.). I've been in therapy for about 6 to 7 years now (just in the interim looking for a new therapist currently), and I really don't think I am any of those things because I think a therapist would have pointed that out to me by now. Is it better for me to just endure dealing with them for now so I get some financial support (this makes me feel guilty, but I also kind of feel ok with it after dealing with a life of bullshit from my family)? I really don't think I'd mind just having contact once a week or so. When I lived with my parents growing up I really do feel that my mom told my dad things so he would fly off the handle towards me, since moving out and being on my own my father and I haven't had a single issue (we talk maybe once a week or once every other week and it's usually short, I still hold some anger towards him since he was verbally pretty mean growing up and things got physical a few times, and don't want to be close but I think he is fine with not being close anyway and he always tells me I'm an adult I can do whatever I want at this point). My dad anyway is the one who provides any financial support (when I chose to go to college my mom attacked me for trying to get back at them by only applying to expensive schools to just further drain them but my dad told me that it's up to me and he's the one paying anyway so to ignore her). I'm sorry this is kind of everywhere, I just really don't know exactly what to do in this situation. I always end up letting my mom in again thinking things are different and better but then I am always let down in the end, but things just really feel different this time and I'm really ready to limit/end contact.

My parents are the type of parents who says crying means you're weak. They can be sometimes judgemental too and ones who sometimes gossip behind your back. 

Back in 2017 I was already dealing with being bullied and feeling isolated in school from my peers. At home I did so too. Being home use to be place where I felt comfortable being myself. I use to be kid who cared and say I love you mom and dad whenever I sleep and gave out hugs. Compared to now it's not the same for me. I seriously hate it and thinking about some of these things makes me hate myself sometimes. 

When I felt depressed for first time in 2017 from having tough time making friends and trying fit in within my peers. When I tried tell my parents about it, they wouldn't believe me that I was depressed. I honestly cried from that point when my parents denied me what I was feeling and going through. They called me weak, bitch, a sussie,  you're nothing blah blah all because I cried and tried tell them I was depressed. I ran to my room and cried and cried so much. I felt sad and frustrated with myself in life. I honestly punched and slapped my face out of frustrations and felt so low in my life in 7th grade. For first time in my life I felt alone with no friends and no parents that's there to comfort you or at least talk things out. I stayed in my room for days, only came out to eat and go back to my room without a word. With me being bullied at school and not being able tell your parents without being called weak. Made me felt like I was at my breaking point of my life. I was truly at my lowest point of life, where I had thoughts hurting myself. What stopped me from harming myself was being afraid of hurting myself.

Even when it's about things like I'm older than you I know more than you. Whenever I'm right about something or appeared to do my research or just know a lot about the subject. They'll call me know it all or get mad about it. They'll just put me down about it. 

Whenever I enjoy something or found something I liked, my parents would often make fun of me and say this is weak or this is stupid, why you're watching that etc. From there the last ounce of me being comfortable around my parents ended. 

It was like a switch turned off to me. I use to feel comfortable and open being with my parents. Now it's like I feel out of touch with them. Where I'm quiet and often feel uncomfortable talking things to them. Even the simplest things like shaving makes me feel uncomfortable to asked them about. Even when something happen to me, I always feel hesitate to talk to my parents about certain things. Which is why I mostly keep to myself. I always know whatever I tell my parents about something I want to be kept between me and them, they'll straight up be ready tell the whole family. The word just spreads crazy to everyone in the family. It's one of the reasons why I feel uncomfortable towards them. 

Example: I know this can be embarrassing to some people, I loved Professional Wrestling ever since I was a kid. I use to watch Raw or Smackdown every Monday and Friday night. Whenever my dad comes out to see it, he'll make fun of me watching it. Would often make comments about it and laugh about it. If I tried to say something about it, he'll get mad about it. Automatically say I'm talking back when I was just trying explain myself. From there my dad ruined my love for professional wrestling, which was something at least I looked forward to watch every week in my life. 

Even on my birthdays they always find a way to ruin it for me. My last birthday my dad often picked on me for smallest things and yelled at me on my birthday. 
Overall I look back at myself feeling lost in this world due to me feeling isolated from my family, and my peers. I feel so empty and drained. Where I'm use to this feeling of emptiness, like I can't say I love you anymore. I often have aneixty attack and depression on my shoulders. I can't really word everything that happened within past few years  I don't understand why I can't but this is all I can say about it. The last person I ever felt comfortable going to was my grandmother. She was always there for me whenever I needed her when I was little. 

In the future I do plan on seeing therapist when ever I can.

Luckily for me, my girlfriend was able to move in by herself, and although I felt really sorry, shamefully I said “ok, fine, I can reschedule” to my parents, even though they promised me that they will definitely drive me back on that day. When I chose last Saturday to go back, they started making excuses like, “oh, we need you to take care of chores because stepdad is busy (mind you, my mother has too many pets and my young brother that need a lot of care)” or “oh, we need you to take the animals to the vet on Sunday”, now that my gf was able to move out by herself. When I suggested I could use (paid by myself) public transportation, they flipped out and told me if I can’t even wait “a bit” just to go to campus, I’m so ungrateful and I’m not welcome in their house. Uh wtf?!

So I ended up not being able to go back last Saturday, and because the only apparent available day they had was this Saturday (yesterday), they told me they DEFINITELY can get me on campus by that time. Deja vu, because my parents came home too late  due to “stocking up pet supplies” that they didn’t even need yesterday and had today (Sunday) to get, and because it was too late to drive me and go back atp (without the restocking, I could have left home at 6pm, but my parents returned at 9pm, which is too late). 

They did try to attempt in telling me they could drive me yesterday night, and when I agreed that if they can drive me yesterday night then I would like them to (my school starts literally tomorrow) but they made snide comments like how I was a ungrateful girl who can’t think for how tired they would get driving me so late, how I will be basically disowned if I chose yesterday night, even how I’d never get a boyfriend with this kind of attitude (I’m not even straight…), etc.

I ended up just not wanting to argue anymore because the situation made me physically sick and dizzy, probably because of how much I was angry (even though I should be grateful to them to take time out to drive me back to college because I don’t have a car).

It also made me realize that my mum has narcissistic tendency. 

Note: I'm raised in an Asian family so sometimes I'm confused whether it is a mental illness or the culture thing. 

As a teen, I was sent to a boarding school in another state to fulfill my grandpa's wish as he always wanted one of his grandchildren to be in the same state as him. When I graduated and moved back to the city, my friends soon ignored me and any attempts to be friendly with them ends up with cold shoulders. It stressed me out and the fact that I lost contact with my friends from my hometown just made me feel even more isolated. Not to mention my whole college years is online. 

So, the only person I could look up to for comfort and love is my mum. I told her how lonely I am and how I feel demotivated. Of course, since the problem never solved I kept telling her the same stories everytime I wanted to vent (which I try to keep on a minimum as to not frustrate her). This time, I was telling her how my bestfriends did not 'show up' for game nights, made me wait for hours only to apologize the next morning. This has been going on for multiple times that I decided to let it out. We were in the kitchen trying to make dinner.

Me: ""..-And yeah sometimes I regret going to school at (state) because I have no friends here. The friends from (state) avoid me.""

Mum: ""You talk like your friends from (state) are evil and mean.""

Me: ""No, I did not?""

Mum: ""You just did by telling that statement.""

Me: ""Please stop putting words in my mouth.""

Mum: ""Look, you keep venting about the same things on and on and it's going to make you mentally ill..-""

Things went downhill from there. I tried to tell her that I just wanted to think about what she just said in silence, but she kept on ranting how I have a pessimistic view in life and that I might have issues. It's ironic since last week, I tried convincing my mum to send me to therapy but she said that I'm just fine. Suddenly I am not? 

During the whole argument, she refused to listen to my points and continued talking until one point I raised my voice to tell her that I respect her as a mother, but she needs to consider my feelings. Oh, I was wrong for doing that.

This made her even more aggravated because she runs to me, grabs my arms and started to make me hit her while  screaming, ""IM AN AWFUL MOTHER, HIT ME! HIT ME BECAUSE IM A BAD PARENT!"" then she sat on the floor while mumbling, ""Maybe I'm just about to have my menopause...""

She whispers some prayers to herself before washing her face and leaves the house. My younger siblings tried to search for her but then I stopped because she always does this whenever she had a fight. 

The fucked up part is, no matter who was right or wrong my mum will always paint me as that one sick, rebellious child to my younger siblings.

Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent? I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom. Feel free to share yours.

1) I wrote about the following in a reply to someone else's post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent:

I grew up in the 70s and 80s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes. Even when I was elementary-school aged, I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes. I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking. When I entered my teen years, I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore. She eventually stopped asking.

However, one day, I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends. My parents had no objection. Later in the day, my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends. I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore; I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing.

Anyway, her sweet demeanor suddenly changed, and through her clenched jaw, she informed me, ""Fine. Then you will NOT be using the car this evening."" However, her threat didn't sway me, and I told her fine. I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said, ""Sorry, we can't go to the movie. My mom won't let me use the car because I won't go buy her cigarettes.""

Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend, her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment. The narcissist in my mom couldn't stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car. Her demeanor once again suddenly changed, and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line, she exclaimed with fake laughter, ""Oh wait, wait! Hold on! You know I was only kidding! Ha ha ha.""

So not only did I get to use the car after all, I semi-shamed my mom, and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again.

2) I have been living in Japan for about 23 years. I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family. Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me.

As you can imagine, it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year, plus spending money while I'm there, etc. Despite this, I have never played the ""poor card"" and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket. My mom, on the other hand, has offered a number of times to either ""chip in"" or ""go half"" on the cost of a ticket. A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket. However, I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached. In fact, out of all these offers and in all my time living here, I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight.

About eight or nine years ago (the last time I ever accepted her offer), she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas. I initially refused and told her it wasn't necessary. However, she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent. She was going on about how she knows it's a lot of money to come home twice a year, how she does things to help my sisters, but, because I live in Japan, she and my dad can't help me as much as they would like, etc.

I finally relented, but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad (which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do) before she went offering to buy an almost $2000 dollar plane ticket for me. She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours.

When I phoned back, my mom's caring and supportive attitude had completely changed. She was now using her half-annoyed half-righteous tone with me; the one where she elongates the last word in every clause/sentence. ""So I talked to your faaatherrr, and he and I have deciiideeddd...""

She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden. She told me that she and my dad would ""help me out"" this time by paying for my ticket, but ""it's about time you considered moving back to Canada because we can't afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan.""

I thought to myself, ""Okay, here we go again."" But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered, but if it were too much trouble, it wasn't necessary, and not to worry about. ""No, No. That's fiiiine. We'll buy your ticket this tiiiime. But you need to think about moving baaack."" Of course, I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket. I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my mom's attitude and he had no say in ""their"" decision that I should move back to Canada.

I got off the phone and though ""F*** it. I'm not going back for Christmas,"" and I meant it. I waited until the next day, and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story, I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible. I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket, but it really wasn't necessary. It was so nice of him to support my mom's offer to pay for my ticket, but I really didn't expect them to buy it. I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer, but it was too generous and I wouldn't be able to accept it. In fact, I've decided to stay in Japan over the holidays.

Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad, my phone started ringing. Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return. I had apparently ""misunderstood"" what she had said, she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket, and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas. All I needed to do was book my ticket, let her know how much it would cost, and she would put the money on my credit card.

3) When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a ""bad back"" (in reality, she couldn't stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work), she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care / after-school care because it was a waste of money. Appreciative of my mom's offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month, my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer. Big mistake.

To give my mom credit, she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part, but even that has it's limits when she's feeling like holding one of her pity parties. It doesn't help that my niece, since she was a small child and even now at 19 years old, is prone to outbursts, breakdowns, and temper tantrums. As my niece got a little bit older, my mom's over-reactions to my niece's over-reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over-react to the slightest misbehaviour.

When she was seven years old, my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school, and not to be outdone, my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself. She phoned my sister to work in hysterics (not the first time) literally bawling about my sister's ""out-of-control, disrespectful, hateful, horrible child"" (you get the picture). And my mom sobbed on and on about how ""I just can't take it anymore. It's just too much! I've had enough! YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter.""

My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background (who knows where my dad had escaped to). My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone.

After getting off the phone, my sister realized that saving money on day care / after-school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse. So before she went to pick up her kids, my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after-school care for my niece and nephew.

When my sister arrived at my parents', my mom came running to the door in hysterics, her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind, ranting about my sister's ungrateful daughter. ""You need to do something about YOUR children (my nephew was now apparently caught up in this). WAAAA!!!""

As my sister is trying to get her kids' coats and boots on, she told my mom to calm down and that ""having a temper tantrum over your seven-year-old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isn't going to solve anything."" My mom for the umpteenth time, ""YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter! I can't take it!! WAAAA!!! At which point my sister told my mom to ""grow up"" and that she didn't need to ""take it anymore"" because from the next day, the kids would both be in after-school care and walked out the door. At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming, ""No!!! No!!! Why!!! {niece's name}!!! No!!! Why!!!"" as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away.

My sister didn't go no contact with my mom after that, but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again, my sister refused and kept them in after-school care.

They are not worth as friends, partners or other relatives as well.

I must say even therapists are enablers, especially when you are young or a teenager. Get rid of them and find a good therapist. If someone invalidates your feelings or perceptions, you are letting them not just enabling other abusers, but abusing you emotionally and verbally as well.

It has been a roller coaster ride of emotions but mentally I have improved so much since I stopped interacting with her.

I am 32. My little brother is my half brother who still lives at home with my mother and step dad. He is 11. The last time I saw him was last year during a small wedding ceremony of one of my other brothers. He spent the whole reception with my husband and I discussing video games he was playing. We ended up buying him a video game that we thought he would like for his switch. He loved it.

Since that interaction my husband and I have been discussing how we would love to do things with him again. Before we went no contact with my mother we had started taking him out and doing stuff with him. We took him to a really cool old arcade and out to pizza. He had a blast and I heard after that outing his new favorite restaurant because the restaurant we took him too.

About a month ago my husband texted my mother to see if it would be possible to take my brother somewhere. We outlined that we are adults and would never talk bad about her or her husband to my brother. We just wanted to have a relationship with my brother and would love to work something out with them. A week passes and we don’t get a response. My husband reaches out again and same thing.. No response.

We get another one of my brothers to ask her if she is receiving our messages. She said she was. He asked her if she was ever going to respond and she says no. This infuriates me and my husband. I had discussed with my therapist that if I didn’t get a response from my mother that I would start making care packages and give them to my brother to give to my youngest brother. We ended up picking out a card, candy, and a Nintendo gift card so he could get himself a game. While filling out the card I say fuck it, let’s go over, I want to give it to him myself.

You guys understand how hard that was for me. I haven’t seen that woman in two years (besides my brothers wedding.) I was just so pissed that she was doing this.. We get there and give him everything. My step dad calls us in the back yard. He acts normal. He tries to chit chat and be pleasant which I appreciated. My mom doesn’t say a word. Both my husband and I could tell she was irked. I mainly talk to my brother about how he’s been and what things he is in to now. Mainly video games and books.. He’s such a smart and cute kid. Seeing him really made my week.

We didn’t stay long.. only about 15-20 minutes. In that time my mother said not a word to me. A few days later I talked to my grandma and she lets slip that she had talked to my mom and she mentioned our visit. Apparently my brother was down before we got there but seeing us made him happy.

The next day my husband again reaches out to my mom to say I’m glad that my brother was happy after our visit and we would love to work something out with them to do something with him. She doesn’t respond. The following day.. I break down and text her. I am polite. No response.

It infuriates me that she’s using my brother as a pawn to get to me. He is an innocent kid! All I know is that I am going to stop reaching out to her. I can’t do this anymore. It is upsetting me too much. I will write my brother letters and post cards and give him packages through my brother. I am going to document every thing I do in the hopes that when he gets older I can show him that I never stopped loving him or carrying about him.

Since my relationship with my girlfriend even started . I came out to my parents 2020 🏳️‍🌈. I introduced my girlfriend to my family as my friend in the beginning because I was still in the closet . My girlfriend starting coming over for only a couple months in 2018 then My parents told me that she can no longer stay the night . Which I thought was strange considering the fact we still went places and talked still. We don’t have a huge gap in our age . I am 20 now and my girlfriend is 24 . I did move out the end of 2019 and spent a lot of time with my girlfriend and her side of the family . not  Necessarily with my family because me and my girlfriend was always together . So if I would come over to my side of the family she wouldn’t be able to come inside so she would be in the car . This went on for the first half of our relationship . They would not speak to her at all which they did before. when I came out to my parents I didn’t get the greatest response . My mom said “  I have opened myself up to the devil &amp; sent me multiple bible scriptures . My Father said he figured it out and he hates my decision and that he is not proud of my decision . He said he doesn’t want my girlfriend around my sisters because he doesn’t want them seeing me with a girl is okay . Right then and there I should have said okay then I won’t come around because we are together . It doesn’t stop there . There a was a situation  months later where my mother feels as if my girlfriend disrespected her because my mother wasn’t listening to me( which has always been the issue even before my girlfriend came into the picture) so my gf basically said how she doesn’t listen to me and don’t get treated the same . My mom was so stuck on how does she know about the favoritism and shit. so of course I confided in my gf. On my graduation I almost didn’t get to walk because my mom was getting her nails done and time was cutting close .it was like she didn’t take it serious . When it came to my younger sister competition or practices being late is out of the question . So I have express this to my girlfriend . So she knew how I felt about my parents not listening to me and not receiving the same treatment as my siblings . She called my girlfriend a manipulator a devil multiple times. My mom called my dad and showed up not listening to anything I had to say he man handled me and threw me in the car and drove off . because Ihave never seen my parents completely out of character and took me away from my girlfriend . I was freaking out trying to explain to my dad what happened . He completely shut me down from trying to explain to him what happened and said he will take me back to the hospital if I continued .( that day I was released from the hospital from  trying to commit Suicide the main reason was them not accepting me and they were FULLY AWARE of tha ) he drove me to my grandma house and she made me read bible scriptures basically trying to push me to believe being gay isn’t right . They took my phone and car ( car is in my name !!)because they felt like  “they were trying to protect me “. Still to this day they feel like they were just trying to protect me .because I was weak and not in  my right mind . I didn’t talk to my parents for a whole year . And in that one year all my parents could do was make assumptions of why I wasn’t talking to them. In there minds they think “ my girlfriend was keeping me from them “ in reality it was them who caused this to happen . When I wasn’t talking to them my dad came to my home and wrote his name on a piece of paper and put it in the driver seat . He still has my back up key to my car . He didn’t knock on my door nor tell me he was coming . He disconnected my phone because I wasn’t talking to him . I believe he forgot that he told me something otherwise . They try to justify there behavior all the freakin time . It’s like they constantly blame my girlfriend for everything and try to view my girlfriend as this negative person because to them “ she disrespected my mom” which she didn’t . I am mentally tired of there assumptions and how much they have caused in my relationship. My girlfriend feels like she is reason that my relationship with my parents is the way that it is now is her fault and I tried explaining to her no it’s them . I don’t know how to get her to understand that they caused this by what they did and what they say . Still to this day my dad keeps saying he rather me be with a male .

Thanks for setting this up, here's my piece:

My parents were never physically abusive, and they have a tendency to love-bomb after doing something wrong, which makes me question what my own instincts tell me about their behavior. For example, they basically made me visit them over the summer and a few months ago they came downstairs at midnight while I was playing video games and proceeded to scream at me until 3am, wouldn't take any self-defense which they framed as me being selfish and disliking it when I was called out, wore me out until I simply just told them what they wanted to hear to make them stop, and the next day gave me a blank check to go out to dinner and a bar with some old high school friends (all fully vaccinated and masked).

Meanwhile, they won't give me the simplest of apologies. The same trip home I jokingly told my mother about a time a few years ago when I put off watching Good Omens for months because she said in one text that she wanted to see it, only for her to get bored of it in 1 episode. Which felt kind of shit at the time since I was looking forward to it and wanted to show her the adaptation of my favourite book, but isn't an abusive action by any means. When I brought it up though, she heavily implied that I was making up false memories. She couldn't even apologize over a tv show, but will scream at me until 3am and expects me to apologize for things that aren't even wrong, but she thinks they are because I don't perfectly conform to exactly what she wants me to do about things involving my own damn life.

Still, they've never laid a finger on me. I come from a pretty comfortable upper-middle class background since my grandfather was big in the oil industry during a lot of lucky boom years so I never hurt for material things. I always had a big, warm roof over my head and nice new family cars. I always had food, heating, clean water, a safe neighbourhood to bike around in, new clothes, and those REALLY expensive shoes and winter coats that last for years. I got the latest game consoles for birthdays and went on twice-yearly vacations to places like Sri Lanka and New York City. I went to a private high school and they let me move to the other side of the world for a pricey university. I was able to come and go as I pleased growing up with the freedom of transit passes and a pretty lax curfew. I had a lot of great things and opportunities basically handed to me that a lot of, if not most, kids don't get, so in a lot of ways, I feel like I'm a spoiled, ungrateful, toxic piece of shit for feeling the way I do about my parents' actions. Because I got all these great things by luck of birth lottery, but I still struggle to return an ""I love you."" 

They never restricted my movement, but they would snoop through my journals and somehow get through my laptop password when I was away. If they found anything they didn't like, it was justified, and sometimes they would act like a family emergency happened just so I would get home quicker, thinking someone was dead, only to get cornered and yelled at for hours because they invaded my privacy. To this day, they say it was justified. 

We would go on long expensive vacations to new countries to explore the world, but if I expressed any distress about how they treated me, they would bring those up and call me an ungrateful asshole because to them, throwing enough money at your kid negates anything wrong you might have done. I remember a dinner one night when I was 14 where, after they had gone through my phone without permission and read all my texts to my friends where I had expressed how I didn't feel supported by their extremely negative reaction to my coming out to them, they said ""Sure, we send you and your friends to comic con last week with 200 bucks and a ticket to meet William Shatner, but I guess we don't support you."" To this day, they deny how they reacted when I told them I was trans.

Now, their tune on that has changed a bit because they know they can't stop me anymore, but they still act as though I need to defer to them how my own transition works. They act like I'm evil and vindictive for being out and open before I told them again at the age of 21. Like I need to put my own life and happiness on hold and continue living a horrible lie because they weren't personally comfortable with it yet.

I feel like they think that, just because they gave me more than enough material things and never hit me, that was enough. As if material objects and enough money thrown at someone was a substitute for genuine connection. And now, I just can't forgive them for how they treated me in the past, but they won't even acknowledge it ever happened, and if they do, they pull the ""you're the real bad guy because this hurts my feelings."" 

I got a lot of hugs and I love yous, but they felt empty when they were contrasted against their actions towards me.

I find myself genuinely wishing sometimes that they were physically abusive, just so I could feel like my feelings are justified. As if this would only be valid if I was beaten and scarred by them, because it's hard to believe the kid who had everything would rather be anywhere else, especially when all the stories you hear about narc abuse come from kids with less fortunate backgrounds. But the truth is, I would rather have a loving and understanding and poor family than what I got.

Please give me your opinion about this!

My in laws have no problems talking about s\*x. My fathert in law (the narcissist) is a 60 something year old man who was clearly never s\*xually satisfied in his life. His wife (the enabler) calls herself a feminist but has no problem having him constantly looking at young girls in the street or objectifying women in general.

They have been talking a lot about s\*xual topics, and I'm ok with that as long as it's kept not personal and maybe as a joking topic of conversation. The problem is, that I think they took it too far??

The other day my mother in law was talking about how she suddently developped inverted n\*pples and was fearing that she had breast cancer, but she got it checked and turned out she's fine, but doesn't like how her breasts look now. Weird thing to say at a dinner table if you ask me, but ok. I told her that some people are born that way and it doesn't mean her breasts are ugly or anything. 

And then she said that she also hates them because she likes to have them s\*cked and now things were going to be harder in bed. This was in front of me, in front of her son, her husband and her 80 year old mother.

In another occasion, she described to us the shape of her lab\*a.

Her husband is even worse.

At some point we were all laughing and having fun, and he asked me if I ""enjoyed s\*x on the table"". This had something to do with the topic of conversation that we were having (which I forgot tbh) but still... quite inappropriate I'd say??? I took it as a joke and just laughed it off, but was actually shocked and confused. This was in front of his wife, who just sat there and said nothing.

The other day, as he was walking behind me, he said that he could see my underpants. I was wearing a short skirt and thought that he was being ""kind"", like when you tell people ""there's spinach in your teeth"" and I just told him ok.

He then added ""I should have told you that I could see that you weren't wearing panties, so you would have raised your skirt to check if it was true that you forgot to wear them!"".

I was shocked. But of course, since I'm just now learning about boundaries, learning to stop people pleasing etc, I just laughed it off!!!! Like I've done multiple times!  
I have confronted my partner about his parents being sexually off in general, and he normalizes this behaviour so much! He said that it's normal for parents to talk about sex in front of their adult child and that it shouldn't be a taboo. He agreed to me that his father was inappropriate when he told me those two things I wrote about, but other things (like his mother describing her l\*bia) are normal for him because it's just ""describing the human body"". Also, he seems to have normalized these behaviours so much that as they're happening, they just fly under the radar for him, and I am the one who brings them up afterwards.

I'm ok with s\*xual topics, but not when they become personal like this (i.e. talking about your s\*x life in front of your son and his partner!).

But still, I'm so ignorant about these things that I don't know where to draw the line... or how.

Can you please give me your input on what is normal and what is not?? What is considered normal behaviour around s\*xual topics between parents and their adult children and what's messed up?

As a bit of context - Nmom has always delighted in refusing all offers of assistance with the housework and then complaining that ""NO ONE EVER HELPS ME.""

She always loved telling me what a lazy, selfish, indolent, spoiled child I was. Even as a kid, I remember pointing out to her that every time I picked up a dustpan and brush, she'd whip it out of my hands and insist I'd only do it wrong.

Anyway - that informs the next part of the story. 

Nmom was driving me to school while passionately complaining about how lazy and ungrateful I was.

""I was telling my physical therapist about how much I slave around the house for you and your father and he said 'well, surely your 11-year-old daughter helps you?' and I told him you do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and he said 'well, then you should leave her. Leave that little girl to look after herself and you go start a nice new life.' That's what he told me.""

Even back then, I didn't believe her - mostly because she quoted EVERYONE as telling her to leave me, from her friends to MY teachers and back again.

""It's the kindest thing a mother can do, you know,"" she said as I was getting out of the car for school. ""If your kids can't take care of themselves, you leave them forever and then they'll be FORCED to learn.""

Hi everyone. I am in my late twenties and I live with my mom who is divorced and is 69. Since my parents divorced when I was young it has just been us. We do not have much other family except for an aunt and uncle that do not live close by. She does not have a car and is retired. She does not have any friends either. I am in a relationship and would like to move in with my girlfriend in the near future. However, my mom has a lot of anxiety and has panic attacks in the evening if I am not home. She has engrained this guilt into me about “leaving” and that she could have an asthma attack or more if I was I ever move out. What can I do in this situation? I am her only social stimulation and she refuses to join any groups/orgs or see a doctor, therapy, anything I suggest. I want to move out but I have this guilt that I’m abandoning her and that it could be detrimental to her health or she could harm herself from loneliness. Any help or thoughts would be extremely helpful.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. By now, he knows a lot of details about my Ndad and what a difficult relationship I have with him, but there are still some moments where my bf doesn’t seem to quite understand the relationship or my thoughts/actions surrounding my behavior with my Ndad, and the problem for me is (as I know a lot of us have experienced) that I sometimes don’t really understand my own emotions around it so idk how to explain it to my bf. 

For example, it’s been very difficult for my bf to understand why I am still in contact with my Ndad. The reality for me right now is that I feel like it’s just easier this way for many reasons. Thankfully, I live in another state from my Ndad, so I’ve been able to gain a lot more control of my own life and keep some distance from him, and I also know that if I attempt going NC, my Ndad would find a way to make my life miserable again. Maybe one day I will find a way to cut off all communication, but as it currently stands, I would essentially have to disappear and restart my life all over again if I wanted to go NC. I’ve told this to my bf, which he still doesn’t seem to fully understand, but has at least accepted as an answer for now. 

However, there are still moments where I will make certain comments that seem to confuse him, which I understand because I have a lot of conflicting emotions surrounding my Ndad as well, and I don’t really know how to explain them to someone who isn’t in this situation. 

As we all know, one of the hallmark traits of narcissists is making themselves the victim of every situation and throwing the blame around for their actions to other people, most often the real victim themselves (in our case, the victims being their children). So that creates a lot of confusing feelings for us growing up because we end up feeling guilty and responsible for situations that we didn’t cause. And narcissists know how to make you feel sorry for them as well too, so we grow up simultaneously feeling like we have the blame for things that are out of our control but also resenting the people who make us feel guilty. Like a constant battle between feeling like the perpetrator and the victim at the same time. 

The other day, I made a comment to my bf about feeling sorry for my Ndad about a current situation he is having surrounding his house, which could cost him a lot of money and stress. My boyfriend responded by saying “did you just hear what you said.” As if he was shocked by me saying I feel sorry for my Ndad. I also recently had to spend a few days with my Ndad on a trip that he was insisting we take for the last two years. My bf kept asking me why I was being nice to my father, and it was difficult for him to understand when I said that it was just easier this way. It was easier to just be nice to my father in certain moments, even if it made me uncomfortable. I was just in the mindset of trying to get through the trip as quickly and conflict free as possible and I knew that my Ndad would throw a tantrum if things didn’t happen the way he wanted them to happen and them every situation would turn into a whole big thing. 

I guess I’ve been rambling a bit and over explaining things that we all already know and experience, but this is also me venting a little bit. Ultimately, of course I know that my father is a toxic person and I may benefit from cutting him out completely, but I just feel like right now cutting him out would end up causing me more stress than anything. But I can understand  how my bf would be confused about the situation when I vent to him about my Ndad but then also say that I feel sorry for him with his current house situation. Which honestly confuses me too, but it’s something that been so ingrained into my psyche since I was a kid that I don’t know how to turn it off. And that’s what narcissists specialized in, manipulating their victims to feel whatever way they want them to feel. 

Despite all this , my boyfriend is still very supportive of me and has helped me a lot, but I guess I was just wondering if others had experienced this same situation with your partners and how you have managed to communicate with them so that they would understand.

I said no, and at first he was like ""come on what's the worst that could happen.""
I was insistent that I didn't want to talk about it because it was a personal issue and he started to get really angry at me.
Saying he just wanted to get rid of my anxiety.

I went to my room and Ndad came up, saying that I had left him in a state of worry because he didn't know if I was going to be a threat or not.
Also going on about how I did it on purpose to wind him up and that I wanted to control the house or something.
He also said I was trying to wind him up on purpose.

I told him that I was not going to talk to him about it and he's immediately like ""if you are going to be a threat to me and try to control the house you can get out of the house.""

So then we arranged that I would leave once I found an appropriate accommodation.

But that wasn't enough, he started saying I had to leave immediately, this instant, because my presence in the house was angering him.
It was the middle of the night and I had no temporary accommodation at this point.
He tries to grab me to throw me out of the house and I call the police, which makes him finally leave me alone.

The next day, he says he wants to talk to me for five minutes, I say yes, hoping to get somewhere but his little conversation is just trying to get me to believe I'm an anxious wreck that has a phobia of him and I can't function on my own, so I need him to tell me what's what.

He goes on this weird rant about scientific facts and evidence and teeth and this anecdote about one of his friends that got all his teeth removed and got dentures instead as some kind of lesson, I have no idea what he was trying to say to be honest.


I state that conversation is pointless and leave the room, since I know it would have gone on for hours.
And to be honest, I'd rather be shouted at him all day than lectured by him, at least when he's shouting I can actually do things and don't just have to sit and listen to him for 5 hours.
And because it's frustrating that he's trying to manipulate my thoughts about myself, to get me to beileve his twisted narritive.

His justification this time is ""that I'm being rude and disrespectful."" But he doesn't invade my personal space a or keep me up all night this time because I start to audio record him and block the entrance to my room whenever he tries.

He does however, tell me that if I contact the police again, that they'll arrest me for wasting police time.
I contacted the police after this and they did tell me to indeed call the emergency number if I needed them.

It's the third day now, no doubt he's gonna keep going at it.
Frankly this is causing mum and Ndad so much stress, I say that and they're like ""you're causing it, it's your responsibility to calm us down.""
Unfortunately, my mum just goes along with everything my Ndad says, because he's been conditioning her for years with his delusional stories of how the world is out to get them.
So whenever he gets angry, she gets angry at whatever he is angry at too, because they're a team I guess.
They even forced my sister to say nasty things to me, and she did because she was scared not to and now dad is using the evidence that my sister hates me to as further proof that I need sorting out.

I think I'm gonna go out to the park for a majority of the day, I don't care if he smashes up my belongings tbh.

I frankly don't think there's any way to calm him down and not be in a situation that is triggering to me.
Because I don't like to have my time wasted.
But I guess that's the only way to make dad think he has control over me.

Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent? I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom. Feel free to share yours.

1) I wrote about the following in a reply to someone else's post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent:

I grew up in the 70s and 80s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes. Even when I was elementary-school aged, I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes. I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking. When I entered my teen years, I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore. She eventually stopped asking.

However, one day, I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends. My parents had no objection. Later in the day, my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends. I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore; I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing.

Anyway, her sweet demeanor suddenly changed, and through her clenched jaw, she informed me, ""Fine. Then you will NOT be using the car this evening."" However, her threat didn't sway me, and I told her fine. I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said, ""Sorry, we can't go to the movie. My mom won't let me use the car because I won't go buy her cigarettes.""

Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend, her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment. The narcissist in my mom couldn't stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car. Her demeanor once again suddenly changed, and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line, she exclaimed with fake laughter, ""Oh wait, wait! Hold on! You know I was only kidding! Ha ha ha.""

So not only did I get to use the car after all, I semi-shamed my mom, and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again.

2) I have been living in Japan for about 23 years. I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family. Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me.

As you can imagine, it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year, plus spending money while I'm there, etc. Despite this, I have never played the ""poor card"" and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket. My mom, on the other hand, has offered a number of times to either ""chip in"" or ""go half"" on the cost of a ticket. A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket. However, I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached. In fact, out of all these offers and in all my time living here, I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight.

About eight or nine years ago (the last time I ever accepted her offer), she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas. I initially refused and told her it wasn't necessary. However, she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent. She was going on about how she knows it's a lot of money to come home twice a year, how she does things to help my sisters, but, because I live in Japan, she and my dad can't help me as much as they would like, etc.

I finally relented, but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad (which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do) before she went offering to buy an almost $2000 dollar plane ticket for me. She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours.

When I phoned back, my mom's caring and supportive attitude had completely changed. She was now using her half-annoyed half-righteous tone with me; the one where she elongates the last word in every clause/sentence. ""So I talked to your faaatherrr, and he and I have deciiideeddd...""

She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden. She told me that she and my dad would ""help me out"" this time by paying for my ticket, but ""it's about time you considered moving back to Canada because we can't afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan.""

I thought to myself, ""Okay, here we go again."" But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered, but if it were too much trouble, it wasn't necessary, and not to worry about. ""No, No. That's fiiiine. We'll buy your ticket this tiiiime. But you need to think about moving baaack."" Of course, I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket. I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my mom's attitude and he had no say in ""their"" decision that I should move back to Canada.

I got off the phone and though ""F*** it. I'm not going back for Christmas,"" and I meant it. I waited until the next day, and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story, I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible. I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket, but it really wasn't necessary. It was so nice of him to support my mom's offer to pay for my ticket, but I really didn't expect them to buy it. I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer, but it was too generous and I wouldn't be able to accept it. In fact, I've decided to stay in Japan over the holidays.

Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad, my phone started ringing. Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return. I had apparently ""misunderstood"" what she had said, she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket, and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas. All I needed to do was book my ticket, let her know how much it would cost, and she would put the money on my credit card.

3) When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a ""bad back"" (in reality, she couldn't stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work), she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care / after-school care because it was a waste of money. Appreciative of my mom's offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month, my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer. Big mistake.

To give my mom credit, she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part, but even that has it's limits when she's feeling like holding one of her pity parties. It doesn't help that my niece, since she was a small child and even now at 19 years old, is prone to outbursts, breakdowns, and temper tantrums. As my niece got a little bit older, my mom's over-reactions to my niece's over-reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over-react to the slightest misbehaviour.

When she was seven years old, my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school, and not to be outdone, my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself. She phoned my sister to work in hysterics (not the first time) literally bawling about my sister's ""out-of-control, disrespectful, hateful, horrible child"" (you get the picture). And my mom sobbed on and on about how ""I just can't take it anymore. It's just too much! I've had enough! YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter.""

My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background (who knows where my dad had escaped to). My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone.

After getting off the phone, my sister realized that saving money on day care / after-school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse. So before she went to pick up her kids, my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after-school care for my niece and nephew.

When my sister arrived at my parents', my mom came running to the door in hysterics, her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind, ranting about my sister's ungrateful daughter. ""You need to do something about YOUR children (my nephew was now apparently caught up in this). WAAAA!!!""

As my sister is trying to get her kids' coats and boots on, she told my mom to calm down and that ""having a temper tantrum over your seven-year-old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isn't going to solve anything."" My mom for the umpteenth time, ""YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter! I can't take it!! WAAAA!!! At which point my sister told my mom to ""grow up"" and that she didn't need to ""take it anymore"" because from the next day, the kids would both be in after-school care and walked out the door. At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming, ""No!!! No!!! Why!!! {niece's name}!!! No!!! Why!!!"" as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away.

My sister didn't go no contact with my mom after that, but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again, my sister refused and kept them in after-school care.

I (20 f) moved out of my parents house about 2 years ago and went no contact with them.   
My father is a very racist person which was always really confusing for me because my parents both immigrated in the country that we are now living in. But he didn't see the irony in it. He says a lot of to put it mildly offensive crap about black and brown people. He especially hates refugees (which is even less understandable since he was a refugee himself!) but I guess when they are not white it means for him that they do not deserve to come to this country. My father knew even back when I was living back home that I did not share his ""opinions"". I rarely spoke up to him in general because he was extremely terrifying to me back then, always screaming and beeing very aggressive. But in that regard I really couldn't take it. The disgusting things he said still haunt me to this day (like for example our chancellor deserves to be r\*ped by refugees because she ""let"" them into this country).   
So when I finally spoke up to him, he just smiled and said that he wasn't beeing serious. (Why would you ever say such a think in general?).   
When I finished school I immediately moved out. I had planned this for a long time since it was an extremely toxic environment in this house and I was in seriosly bad mental state. My mom, my sister (25 f who moved out when she was 18) and I never said more than two or three words while my dad just kept rambling his disgusting shit over and over again. He felt entitled to our time. Never asked my sister or me about our interests or even our opinion about anything. Whenever we were talking to each other louder than whispering he would scream what was going on and that he would have to deal with something now. My sister moved out and my mental state started getting worse. I would never go out of my room, I cried a lot and whenever he felt like talking to me I just didnt say anything and waited until his rambling was over. After a year or so, my parents realised that something was wrong with me. My mother tried to talk to me but I was still silent. My father screamed at me that I would hate them and that somebody was influencing me to hate my parents (he thought it was liberal green propaganda). I still wasn't answering. He talked to my sister (who knew how I felt) but when she just denied to answer him, she yelled that she would be at fault if I would kill myself. I knew I need to get out. So that was the first thing I did when I finished school. I have been working for two years back then so I had a little money. 

So I moved out and immediately got no contact. My father was furious for a while: texting me, calling me and threatening me. He said I was a bad and ungrateful daughter and so on. I just didnt reply. 

I got therapy, a new appartment and a fantastic boyfriend so I feel fine now. He stopped harrassing me and I am really happy about that. My sister is still in contact with them both but feels very similar towards them. Recently she decided that she needed some boundaries. She talked to my mother and accidently started a shit storm. My mother threatened her with the police (I really dont know what the police could do about this situation) and my father basically kicked her out of the family while saying that she is morally abhorrent. This really effected her badly and she wasn't sure what to do. I only recommended her to ignore it and wait because he will just get over the situation after a while.

So the last text he send to her was so funny to me and really inspired me to post here. He said that he is sad that the propaganda influenced her that much that she is now hating her immigrant parents. He said that she can never become ""one of them"" no matter how badly she tries. So basically calling her a racist towards her own parents. 

I am just buffled by the irony of that. He probably thinks that because racism influences every of his decision that other people are like that too and never in his life thinks about that this has nothing to do with his nationality but with him simply beeing a bad person.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,714101,public,self,Father playing the victim by saying his daughters are racist towards him,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p9bm8u/father_playing_the_victim_by_saying_his_daughters/,some_ads,7,supporturgent,b4c5598c-82c9-11e3-9642-12313d27e9a3,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

I read some of the discussions started in here and I think it would be helpful for me to explain here my situation. Before I start, I'm sure my parents aren't the worst here, but their personalities are pretty toxic for someone who has to live with them 24/7. I'm a 16 yo, 189 cm tall (&gt;6'2) and 70 kilos (150 lbs). If someone had to hang out with me, he would always see me smile and joke, but the sad reality is that I'm deluded and in my life I've numerous times been thinking of committing suicide. All because of my parents. This thoughts were far more numerous when I was a kid, about 9 to 14, before calming down until I was this age. I'm not a dominant person, often trying to do my best to help others and disappear when I feel unnecessary and unneeded. This is a result of the jail my parents put me in during these years, where I have to obey their every order. I have always been scared of them and the only thing that kept driving me was the hope of becoming bigger and stronger, in order to defend myself from them. 

Now to my parents. My mother was born in a military family. As a result, she is very strict, often resulting in her using violence as a method of both punishment and encouragement. I remember when I was a 7 years old, she broke a rolling pin on my wrist. A new one she had brought the week before. And that wasn't the worst. She has probably always dreamed of a kid she could be proud of, and I have done my best to meet her expectations. I play volleyball in the first squad, where people are usually two times my age, challenging them for the spot in the titulars. I have brilliant result at school, making my school seem like a playground and I'm extremely well behaved. I'm luckier than some, because my parents compliment me and in my life they showed to care about me, but it isn't a less toxic situation. I always think I'm not enough for what I do. If my friends don't message me, if a girl isn't interested in me, if I can't do something at school and in the gym. I'm simply not enough. 

My father is a unempathetic person. He works at home, having almost zero contact with others. This transformed his job of teaching me about life to plasmating me in the best kid ever. Loving me when I do something he likes, hating (no, I'm not joking, he often overreacts, reaching physical punishment) when I don't behave like he taught me.

My father and my mother hate my phone, telling me how much time I waste on it. I myself have grown to hate my waste of time. I use my phone about 4 hours a day during schooltime, which may seem a great amount of time, but when contextualized it's not that great. I try to hang out with my friends in the evening, so I have to chat with them, plus my homework is in the phone, because my teachers use Google Classroom. 

I'm sorry if I bragged too much, but I wanted to write about this in the most concise yet precise way possible. I don't expect advises, but they are more than welcomed.

- when I was in kindergarten to first grade, I remember my mom constantly pretended to drop me off and leave me at graveyards and cemeteries in the winter when I had an attitude or made her upset. I remember crying and holding onto the door handles of the car pleading as my mom allowed Aidan to open the door, pull me out, and then jump back in and zoom off as I tried to scramble to my feet, boogery nosed and terrified, running after the car, as my older brother laughed while sticking his head out the window while I continued to run to which she’d of course speed up and disappear over the horizon. I’d just fall to the ground on the sandy dirt road, as the frost bit my face and cry for what felt like an eternity before she’d come back. 

- Urinated on my bare mattress, soaked it to the point I had to throw it away and sleep on the floor for weeks because of an argument. 

- when I was around 15, she gave me a black eye while she was driving and I was in the passenger, shortly after, while in a bad neighborhood, she leans over (still driving) and opens my door, unbuckles my seatbelt, and screams at me to get out of the car. Again, I was pleading with her even as she began pushing me with her free hand that wasn’t on the wheel. I fell out and rolled onto the side of the street. Cars behind us witnessed it all. (Because we were on our way to pick up Ezra and Wesley from school, she said not to worry about changing my clothes since we weren’t getting out of the car. so all I was wearing was shorts, a tank top with no bra, one sock, and no shoes.) I wandered that bad neighborhood crying and desperately trying to call anyone to pick me up before she of course, came and found me, and began apologizing like crazy. 

- took my lock away for talking past hours on the phone to my biological dad. this resulted in many embarrassing no knock walk ins where I’d be partially or entirely naked, and then my stepdad or brothers would embarrassingly close the door. 

- when Aidan made the choice to be homeless because he didn’t want to follow the no drugs in the house rule, my mom frequently woke me up in the middle of the night and crawled into my bed while I was nearly, and would sob heavily over her nightmares about something bad happening to my older brother. I would comfort her as she laid on me. 

- Made it a point to humiliate me in front of guys I was dating by saying “I hope looks are all that matter to you because she can’t cook a hot meal or do a load of laundry if her life depended on it! I remember when she used to go weeks without showering or brushing her teeth!” (I am now moved out and am a great cook, and can do laundry just fine. with a house of 7 people, the washer and dryer was always packed so I couldn’t find time to wash my clothes between work and school, and the exaggerated poor hygiene was a result of Aidan taking his infamous 2-3 hour long showers multiple times a day, and not letting anyone in to get anything. when the bathroom was free, I took care of myself.) 

- pinning me down against my bed and threatening me, repeating “you wanna fucking box? You wanna go? I’ll break you in half easily because I think you forget I’m twice your size and can easily beat the shit out of you.” just spit droplets hitting my face while I hold back tears and bite my tongue before she gets up and walks out of my room saying “That’s what I thought.” (her putting her hands on me and threatening to beat me was a constant thing, I never dared to lay a hand on her because I knew she was right. I’ve never put hands on my mother.) this all happened because she was disappointed I was doing bad in school. I was 19 at the time. this would be the same argument that pushed me to book a greyhound ticket to a whole different state to stay with my biological dad who I hadn’t seen in over 6 years because I needed space from her. 


- when I was going through puberty, I couldn’t get comfortable with pads because even the maxi pads would bleed through my heavy flow, and tampons scared me and were painful every time I tried, so I began stuffing large amounts of toilet paper in my underwear because I found this was the only thing that stopped the mess. when we were going into church one day, I guess my mom told my stepdad because she found out a few days prior by questioning why the toilet paper kept running out so fast. And my stepdad upon observation and seeing the toilet paper outline through my dress, began calling me “donkey balls”, Aidan and Wesley and even my mom had the time of their lives laughing. I was anemic. 

- starting at 7 when my parents decided to get a divorce, she began leaning on me very heavy and would come into my room at night after we moved into apartments and left our childhood house. she would express how she just wants to take her car and drive off a cliff or blow her brains out and just die. and that there is nothing in life that brings her happiness. (Even though she had 3 whole kids at the time.) Being so young I was would just cry and beg her not to, and then she’d just get up and go to sleep. I wouldn’t be able to sleep the rest of the night, terrified that I’d wake up and not have a mom anymore. 

- calling the police on me for “domestic disturbance” when i tried to come visit Wesley after I was disassociated from the religion and was being shunned. She told me that she has not been keeping any of my siblings from reaching out to me, that they haven’t reached out to me because “they don’t want a relationship with you.” I ubered there, and when she came back outside after giving me permission to speak to Wesley privately, and began calling the police, I just once again, humiliated, left on foot crying walking down the street. I had no weapons and did not try to enter into the home. (I had not even been moved out for a year yet.) 

- constantly asking people right in front of me “don’t you think she would look far more beautiful if she had long straight hair?” right after I chopped my curly hair into a short off the shoulder fro. pressuring me to flat iron it before special occasions, job interviews, meeting a boy she liked for me for the first time, etc. I would get so angry because it was so often she’d make such a huge deal. 

- not checking in on how I was doing emotionally when my older brother attempted to overdose in front of me and the two youngest. he just went to the kitchen cabinet and began opening every prescription bottle of pills and downing them all as I tried to stop him. he ends up leaving the house, as I’m pulling on him begging and trying to get him to stay, but he’s too strong and he leaves out the front door. since I’m watching Ezra and Fiona while my parents are working, I couldn’t leave to chase him and didn’t have a car yet, so I had to call the police who phoned the ambulance even though I told them he isn’t at home over the phone. 3 ambulances and 2 police cars later, parents rushed home after the police have already searched our house, they find him by a convenient store, mom is crying as she listens to the ordeal on the police radio because he’s trying to run and refuse detainment. they catch him, and he is baker acted in the hospital. he didn’t want to see me in there, and still resents me to this day from stopping him. that was traumatic as hell for me, as I was made to feel like it was my fault, and nobody came to see how I was doing. but all 3 of my other siblings are asked by my mom and stepdad if they’re okay and are all talked to separately. 

allowing my stepdad to put me in a headlock in front of my three younger siblings. I was by the front door wanting to go for a drive to cool off after a heated discussion because I was 18 and should be able to do that, but because it was close to 11pm, my stepdad chases me to the door and puts me in the headlock to the point I’m struggling to breathe and crying to let me go and that I can’t breathe, and my mom is standing there saying “yeah just go, just go and abandon your siblings just like Aidan!” and then she turns my attention to the corner of the hallway where all of my siblings are peering, there staring at me. I hate that day so much. It makes me choke up with anger. I am very sensitive about hands around my neck to this day, even if it’s in a playful manner because of this incident and ones like it.

- a year later from this incident, while my stepdad is at work, my mom creates yet another argument out of thin fucking air while I’m in my room, just about how I’m not doing the things I’m supposed to be, and that she’s disappointed I’m not where I should be at in life, she kicks me out again in front of my siblings, and I drive off to a grocery store parking lot and just cry alone in my car. I end up coming back a few hours later and she once again, apologizes and says she didn’t mean it. 

- always making me feel like I couldn’t come to her for help when I needed it. I remember being 16 or so and my car ran out of gas to get to work. luckily I was able to pull into a gas station before it gave out on me, but I just remember checking my bank account and crying to myself in my car because I didn’t know who I could ask. 

- Had knowledge that I was struggling financially in my arranged marriage. (which I am free from now.) knew that I was being raped, physically abused, and verbally abused, knew that I didn’t have toilet paper to wipe my ass, paper towels, dish soap, laundry detergent, gas money, food, that I had received multiple eviction notices, knew that I needed HELP, but instead told one of my friends who relayed it back to me that “I hope she knows if she gets evicted, she’s not welcome back here. She got herself into this mess, she can get herself out of it. then expressed her intense disappointment in me for getting a divorce and leaving the religion and betraying the family. (Yet when Aidan was “homeless,” she spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars buying him new phones, booking him the most luxury bus tickets to get to whatever state he was needing to get to, sending him money for food, for clothes, just anything.) in case you couldn’t tell, Aidan has first born favorite privileges with mom. 


this list could go on forever. my family has put me through so much shit, and I have done nothing but try my best to stay out of the way and not create more problems. I paid for things myself, I helped pick up Wesley, Ezra, and Fiona most days from school when I started driving, I gave up a social life to babysit constantly, I’ve spoiled my the youngest two and continued to care for them even after moving out, took them on trips, did arts and crafts with them, built forts, took them dolphin watching at the pier on the weekends, to the fair, movies, sleepovers at my apartment, stayed up til daylight playing video games, I just feel like so used and thrown away. Like the giving tree at the end. just a stump. accept nobody comes and appreciates me despite just being a stump. 

I feel all used up and without any value anymore. I feel like back then no one ever saw me, or made a big deal about my accomplishments or even told me they loved me. my mom was trimming my hair one time, and she moved the curtain of hair from my face to pause and say, “I love you.” It was so out of nowhere and I hadn’t heard her say that in so long, that as soon as she moved the hair back to continue trimming, a lump instantly formed in my throat and tears rolled down my face. Our relationship is so strange and I hate how much I adored her and how hard it is to not miss her because I can hardly think of a day she didn’t find a way to make me feel like absolute shit. 

The toy story 2 scene where Jessie has a flashback of when she used to be loved by her kid, that song “when she loved me”, really messes with me. I just want to be able to move on. It feels so pathetic even writing this. I wanna not cry anymore. I want to forget. I just have so much anxiety and fear of abandonment and fear that I’m gonna be a failure of a mother to my first child that I’m currently pregnant with. Confusion. I ask myself daily, “when is it that I became trash?” I just feel so alone.

Her reaction was that she was going to as she said “knock me to the ground in such a way that I wouldn’t want to get up” they were always very verbally abusive and such but never physical. I was adopted as a young teen and I often wondered growing up if they regretted it everyday and that’s why they acted like they hated me so much. They would make me clean the whole house and wouldn’t offer any help but if I missed the smallest thing I would be degraded and it was the end of the world. I was worthless to them for making the smallest mistakes. When I finally left I went to a friend’s house and saw the way they were living and it was upsetting for me because I would put so much effort and emphasis on cleaning everything before bed and everything I did had to be perfect. I started having a panic attack over the dishes not being done and when I calmed down I was told that it was fine if they weren’t done cause it was late and could be done later. They asked me why I cared so much about dirty dishes and I literally responded with “cause we’ll be in trouble if it’s not done before your parents go to sleep.” And at that point I realized that the way I was raised was by tyrants to the point that I didn’t know what to do without someone telling me what I was allowed to do. It is very upsetting though that when I go to their house now my mom never does the dishes and when my sister doesn’t do them no one ever says anything.,True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,714075,public,self,Loss of autonomy and built in fear,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p99swv/loss_of_autonomy_and_built_in_fear/,some_ads,7,supporturgent,b4c5598c-82c9-11e3-9642-12313d27e9a3,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

Do any of you have any examples of you outsmarting a narcissistic parent?  I have a couple examples below of my sister and I outsmarting my nmom.  Feel free to share yours.

1) I wrote about the following in a reply to someone else's post who had built up the courage to say no to their nparent:

I grew up in the 70s and 80s when there were basically no age restrictions on who could buy cigarettes. Even when I was elementary-school aged, I can remember my mom giving me money to run into the corner store to buy her a pack of cigarettes. I hated doing this and my mom was well aware of how I felt about it and her smoking.  When I entered my teen years, I put my foot down and refused to do this for her anymore.  She eventually stopped asking.

However, one day, I had asked to use the car to go to the movies with my friends. My parents had no objection. Later in the day, my mom in a sickening sweet way asked me if I would go to the store to buy her cigarettes before I went to pick up my friends. I reminded her of my policy about not doing this for her anymore; I was actually surprised she was asking because it had been at least two or three years since I had started refusing.

Anyway, her sweet demeanor suddenly changed, and through her clenched jaw, she informed me, ""Fine. Then you will NOT be using the car this evening."" However, her threat didn't sway me, and I told her fine. I then immediately got on the phone to one of my friends and said, ""Sorry, we can't go to the movie. My mom won't let me use the car because I won't go buy her cigarettes.""

Upon my mom hearing me say this to my friend, her clenched jaw suddenly loosened and almost hit the floor in shock and embarassment. The narcissist in my mom couldn't stand the thought of looking bad in front of my friends or having it get back to their parents about why I could no longer use the car. Her demeanor once again suddenly changed, and in this overly friendly voice loud enough for my friend to hear on the other end of the line, she exclaimed with fake laughter, ""Oh wait, wait! Hold on! You know I was only kidding! Ha ha ha.""

So not only did I get to use the car after all, I semi-shamed my mom, and she never once even tried to ask me to buy her cigarettes again.

2) I have been living in Japan for about 23 years.  I usually go back to Canada twice a year in the summer and winter to see my family.  Not once in my over twenty years of living here have my parents even attempted to come and visit me.  

As you can imagine, it can be quite costly flying back to rural Canada two times a year, plus spending money while I'm there, etc.  Despite this, I have never played the ""poor card"" and I have never once asked my parents to pay for either part or all of my plane ticket.  My mom, on the other hand, has offered a number of times to either ""chip in"" or ""go half"" on the cost of a ticket.  A couple of times she has even offered to fully buy the ticket.  However, I have refused the overwhelming majority of these offers knowing that if I accepted she would either conveniently forget to follow through or there would be some hidden strings attached.  In fact, out of all these offers and in all my time living here, I have only ever accepted three times when money was a bit tight.

About eight or nine years ago (the last time I ever accepted her offer), she offered to pay for my whole ticket to come home at Christmas.  I initially refused and told her it wasn't necessary. However, she continued to insist and started playing the concerned supportive parent.  She was going on about how she knows it's a lot of money to come home twice a year, how she does things to help my sisters, but, because I live in Japan, she and my dad can't help me as much as they would like, etc.

I finally relented, but I told my mom that she should at least check with my dad (which would basically mean my mom telling my dad what she was going to do) before she went offering to buy an almost $2000 dollar plane ticket for me.  She agreed and told me to phone her back in a couple of hours.

When I phoned back, my mom's caring and supportive attitude had completely changed.  She was now using her half-annoyed half-righteous tone with me; the one where she elongates the last word in every clause/sentence.  ""So I talked to your faaatherrr, and he and I have deciiideeddd...""

She basically went on to make it sound like I had asked them to buy my ticket and that it had now become their burden.  She told me that she and my dad would ""help me out"" this time by paying for my ticket, but ""it's about time you considered moving back to Canada because we can't afford to be subsidizing your travel and paying for plane tickets back and forth to Japan.""

I thought to myself, ""Okay, here we go again.""  But I decided not to get into it and plainly told my mom that she was the one who offered, but if it were too much trouble, it wasn't necessary, and not to worry about.  ""No, No.  That's fiiiine.  We'll buy your ticket this tiiiime.  But you need to think about moving baaack.""  Of course, I knew my mom had probably lied to my dad telling him that I had asked them to buy my ticket.  I also knew my dad had nothing to do with this sudden change in my mom's attitude and he had no say in ""their"" decision that I should move back to Canada.

I got off the phone and though ""F*** it.  I'm not going back for Christmas,"" and I meant it.  I waited until the next day, and knowing that my dad had not been given the full story, I sent an email emphasizing it was an offer from my mom as much as possible.  I told him that I really appreciated their offer to buy my plane ticket, but it really wasn't necessary.  It was so nice of him to support my mom's offer to pay for my ticket, but I really didn't expect them to buy it.  I finished off the email by once again thanking them for the offer, but it was too generous and I wouldn't be able to accept it.  In fact, I've decided to stay in Japan over the holidays.

Within half an hour of me sending the email to my dad, my phone started ringing.  Caring and supportive mom had made her triumphant return.  I had apparently ""misunderstood"" what she had said, she and my dad were happy to pay for my ticket, and they were really looking forward to me coming home for Christmas.  All I needed to do was book my ticket, let her know how much it would cost, and she would put the money on my credit card.

3) When my nmom quit working and went on a disability pension for a ""bad back"" (in reality, she couldn't stand the fact that my dad had retired and she was still going to work), she told my sister to pull my niece and nephew out of day care / after-school care because it was a waste of money.  Appreciative of my mom's offer and happy to be able to save several hundred dollars a month, my sister and her husband took my mom up on her offer.  Big mistake.

To give my mom credit, she has been a loving and devoted grandmother for the most part, but even that has it's limits when she's feeling like holding one of her pity parties.  It doesn't help that my niece, since she was a small child and even now at 19 years old, is prone to outbursts, breakdowns, and temper tantrums.  As my niece got a little bit older, my mom's over-reactions to my niece's over-reactions were increasing to the point that my mom would over-react to the slightest misbehaviour.

When she was seven years old, my niece was having one of her meltdowns after school, and not to be outdone, my mom used the opportunity to go into full meltdown mode herself.  She phoned my sister to work in hysterics (not the first time) literally bawling about my sister's ""out-of-control, disrespectful, hateful, horrible child"" (you get the picture).  And my mom sobbed on and on about how ""I just can't take it anymore.  It's just too much!  I've had enough! YOU and YOUR husband had better do something about YOUR daughter.""  

My sister told my mom she needed to calm down and tend to the kids as she could hear both my niece and nephew crying uncontrollably in the background (who knows where my dad had escaped to). My sister was to be off work within the hour and told my mom that they would deal with it when she went to pick the kids up as my mom continued to wail through the phone.

After getting off the phone, my sister realized that saving money on day care / after-school care was not worth it since this had been an ongoing issue over the last few years and it had only seemed to be getting worse.  So before she went to pick up her kids, my sister contacted the local daycare centre and arranged for after-school care for my niece and nephew.

When my sister arrived at my parents', my mom came running to the door in hysterics, her two wailing and sobbing grandchildren close behind, ranting about my sister's ungrateful daughter.  ""You need to do something about YOUR children (my nephew was now apparently caught up in this). WAAAA!!!""  

As my sister is trying to get her kids' coats and boots on, she told my mom to calm down and that ""having a temper tantrum over your seven-year-old granddaughter having a temper tantrum isn't going to solve anything.""  My mom for the umpteenth time, ""YOU need to do something about YOUR daughter!  I can't take it!! WAAAA!!!  At which point my sister told my mom to ""grow up"" and that she didn't need to ""take it anymore"" because from the next day, the kids would both be in after-school care and walked out the door.  At which point my mother in a complete about face acting like she had just been abandonned by her grandchildren starting screaming, ""No!!! No!!! Why!!! {niece's name}!!! No!!! Why!!!"" as my sister got into the car with her kids and drove away.

My sister didn't go no contact with my mom after that, but despite my mom asking several times over the next year to let her take care of the kids after school again, my sister refused and kept them in after-school care.

My mom expected me to get my sister an expensive present for her, because my sister, who earns a lot more money than me, always buys presents for me for my birthday while I often make things for her by hand (crochet). Where my mom got the idea that my sister was somehow ""owed"" any of MY money, idk. I bought something nice for myself after months of saving up for it. That was enough for my sister to not get me anything for my birthday, which was 2 weeks later, and also just leave the house later in the day to go sleep at her boyfriend's house or something. 

I later found out my mom was actually the one who encouraged her to get me nothing. My birthday was fucking ruined. When I arrived at school the next day, a Monday, my classmates threw a better birthday for me than my family had, which was just kinda sad as we literally celebrated my birthday during a Geography class.

2 weeks ago, my sister mocked the fact that I was raped by my ex-boyfriend at the dinner table. She said ""I get why he raped you. Actually, I don't, you are ugly and nobody would want to rape you anyway.""

Needless to say, that comment absolutely crushed me. I have been in specialized TF-CBT and EMDR therapy for the fact that I was raped, and was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18, mostly because of the event. It has ruined my life, and I still suffer from the after-effects every day of my life. 

I have tried to avoid my sister, but my mom asked me today what I was gonna get her for her 18th birthday, which is in 5 days. I said ""nothing"".

My mom absolutely exploded on me. She said she could not understand how I was so selfish. I asked her if she could not see why, and told her because of that comment. She said I was holding ""old events"" over her head, that I was lazy and selfish, and that I will ruin her birthday.

My mom apparently thinks that ""not getting my sister an expensive gift for no reason from the money I was owed, within 2 weeks after getting it"" was a sin great enough to skip my birthday and ruin it over, but my sister mocking the most severely traumatic event that has ever happened to me is not.

YOU'RE TOO SENSITIVE - It doesn't matter what I've said, what I've done. If you're hurt by it, it doesn't mean I did the wrong thing, it means you're too sensitive. You have to change so that you fit my agenda. It doesn't even occur to me to think of how you feel, to care about that, to adjust. It's your responsibility to not feel hurt. It is not my responsibility to try not to hurt you, and to care if I have. You make me feel bad when I hurt you. Stop it. Shut up. Stop speaking. Lie down and let me walk all over you.

YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT HOW I MEANT IT - You're crazy. You're very inferential. You take everything the wrong way. I never mean it the way you think I do. I didn't mean it. It was just a joke. Can't you lighten up? 

YOU HEARD SOMETHING I DIDN'T SAY - I didn't say that. I said something else. Once you said it back to me, I realised how it sounds, so I'm going to shift everything so it sounds like you're crazy and I didn't say it. Why would I say something like that? Why do you secretly hate me? 

THEY'RE JUST MENTALLY ILL, THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER - Why do you have to tell the truth about what they say and do? Why do you have to make me face the reality of this too? What do you expect me to do?! It's just their own form of mental illness. They don't understand what they're doing. They don't mean any harm. 

YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRUST - It doesn't matter what's actually happened, what matters is that you don't know how to trust. All of this is because of that, not because of our actions. If you could just learn to trust, you'd see that we aren't really doing or saying any of these things to you. 

I TRUST YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE NO CHOICE UNLESS I WANT TO BE COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY ALONE. EVERY TIME IT IS SHATTERED AT MY FEET.

IT'S MY FAULT I'M BEING ABUSED. I DESERVE MY ABUSE. IF I COULD JUST NOT FEEL MY ABUSE EVERYONE WOULD FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE.

My parents separated when I was very young and my mom eventually won full custody and moved me out of state away from my father, stepmom, and my new brother and sister. Nmom said awful (untrue) things about my father to me growing up and threatened to commit suicide in front of me two times when I was 9-10 or so. She claims that never happened. 

After being married for 7 years and having a child, I am now divorced and have spent the last 4.5 with an amazing woman - we have two more kids of our own and a house but aren’t married. 

We were traveling this summer and invited my mom to stay with us for a week and visit the grandkids. She was so insulted that we had told her that her visit would be capped at 7 nights that she texted the night before that she wasn’t coming. The next morning I awoke to her texting me that she was on the plane. After an awkward five days together, my mom finally decided to unload on me that she thinks my partner is “bossy” and that the one week visit limit was her idea and I was weak for going along with it. The three of us had a sit down and my partner told my mother that she didn’t have to like her but she had to respect her. My mother showed so much respect to her she left on the next flight out of town two hours later, a day earlier than planned, without even saying goodbye.  

That was six weeks ago and we haven’t spoken since. Last week mother called my 12 year old and told her that she didn’t know why I was mad at her but I am acting childish and haven’t called her in months. She did however text me to say that she would be cutting me off financially from her, removing me as beneficiary of her accounts, and even stopping the $50 she puts monthly into my childrens college funds. I have been successful enough on my own to not need her money, but we do live in a house that she helped us buy a few years ago so she is on the deed and mortgage with us. 

She has shown so little regard for my partner, the boundaries we wished to uphold, and my own happiness that I am considering never speaking to her again.

First my landlord in my new apartment confirmed the ac was fine...it's barely putting out air and I live in a hot climate and can't really open the historical windows. I didn't realize I rented an oven and I have a neurological illness that flares in heat. 

Then my parents surprise showed up to ""help"" me move. They gave me a 5min warning when they were near my old place and I had to bolt over only to find them bitching and complaining that they drove 3 hours (translation: where are the rose petals?). Btw they live 1.5h away they just love to exaggerate. For the area we live in that's a normal commute. Neither actually work though so they think it's worth complaining about. 

They didn't help. From the second I opened my motub to ask if they were going ti help me with a desk and rug too heavy to carry and install they started barking threats and abuse at me. Of course they don't listen to a thing I say ever so I'm constantly repeating myself: reminding them i don't have guest parking, the building code makes my buildings parking valet only (historic, it's law, not the luxury it sounds like) so I can't as easily just jump in my car and go. Repeated myself left, right and center why I was moving apartments, repeated myself to not wear shoes on the carpet i just got cleaned for moveout, repeated myself for them to hold the plant id given one to hold in their lap, i don't need it spilling all over the rug i just cleaned. Of course they never listen to anything that doesn't come out of their mouth. 
My dad got barking mad, screaming at me in the car ride over so loud and hard that I thought he was going to have a heart attack. I know if I were in the front seat he wouldn't gave hesitated to grab my neck and break it. Why? Because I wasn't telling him the directions to my new place. I was, he wasn't listening. It's been a long time that I've ever hoped someone's just dropped dead on the spot and the last time it was a man who assaulted me. That's how low my dad is. Also he didn't need directions, i was moving two blocks away. I could point at the new place! 

Did they help with anything? No
Did they want praise for not even meeting the bare minimum? Yes 
Did they trash my stuff, mock me, call me retarded, try to kill a bunch of people crossing the street calling them ""all homeless and disabled so they deserve to die"" (I'm disabled btw)? Yes 
Did they go on clueless boomer tirades that everyone hiring now and millennials like me are all just too lazy to work? What about making fun of me for moving more in my life than in theirs (yeah dipshits because you were able to buy a house on minimum wage at 22 with no education). Yes yes and yes 
They also cut me off, giggling that they can't wait for me to die on the street. For what? To prove what point? I have no fucking idea. One second I say why's the plant inhe back i told you not to out it near the rug, and the next second dad was violent, crazed, threatening to kill me, calling me a deadbeat retard because i havent been able to get any job, and they were both giggling and screaminf they were cutting me off. 
They really didnt help much to begin with but it kept me not evicted. 



And to top it all off, my car got stolen tonight. 

I have no idea what to do but i just want to die already. I have nothing and no one. Not a sibgle friend willing to help me move or look for my car.

(I’m literally camping out in the bathroom as I type this bc she snipes whenever she sees my phone and my desk with computer is right beside hers) 

It happens now and then. In any discussion topic where old people are brought up, my asian mother will always find a way to sweetly say “See, you have to be kind and good to your mom. You’re the only child so you’ll have to take of me when I’m older. You’ll let me live with you so you can take care of me right??” 

I feel like such a piece of shit every time this happens. I have to say “yes” because any other reply is unthinkable, but she always detects my insincerity and gets unhappy and I can’t convincingly pretend I care for her I just can’t do it. Also in asian cultures, having older generations live with the younger is standard because it’s expected for children to take care of their parents. It makes me want to die every time I think about it. 

My dream is to move halfway across the world and never see my parents again, but as the only child I can’t do that. My mother can’t control her anger, is childish at times and is an emotionally manipulative narc, but she and my dad have worked really hard to fund my schooling/extracurriculars and going NC would be a poor way to repay their effort. Yet I’m depressed and probably have some sort of PTSD from surviving at home. I have a lot of emotional issues from surviving her and having no good example to learn from. 

I don’t know what I’m going to do. As a short term plan I’m banking on getting into a university that’s across the country so I’ll have some semblance of freedom even if they’re paying for it. But even if I get in I don’t know what I’ll do after. I will not move back to my home city. I cannot bear to do so. My parents will expect me to repay their efforts. The only thing I can think of would be to somehow get a job that makes enough money to pay for a senior care home and I’ll send them money from wherever I live - though the issue with that is I’ll have to pay the brunt of it bc we’re a low/middle income family. And I’ll have to pay for  them living in an expensive city while also sustaining myself. 

I despair every time thinking about what to do. If I can manage to become financially independant there’s technically nothing stopping me from going NC but I have no idea how to completely go independent. There’s always bound to be some kind of form or document or bank statement that my parents have to agree to/sign that my mom will never do to ensure I can’t leave her. Esp. because they have saved up some money for me and since I’m going into science/med it’ll be a long time before I can get a stable job and be unreliant on their money funding my education. And it’s worse that I don’t even live in a terrible household. We always have food, I have endless access to extracurriculars and education, and my parents work long hours to ensure I don’t feel like money is an issue.

I've compared the difference between my mom and dad and how they treat me. My dad always gives my siblings and I, overwhelming love and he tries to help as much as he can and give us space and tips support us despite my parents being divorced. My mom on the other hand, as much as she says she helps me and does things for me, holds those things over my head throws them back in my face and uses them to guilt trip me into feeling bad and doing what she wants me to do.

I'm 20 now, soon to be 21. I have to share a car with mom cause I have yet to get help with getting one for myself since she wants to pick it for me. Other than that, the only thing she does for me is let me love at the house rent free and do my laundry. I pay for my own groceries. I pay my phone bill. Buy my own clothes/shoes/jewelry/ etc. I sometimes buy my own dinner when I'm out cause in her words ""you have all that money saved up, go get yourself dinner"". She, quite often, tells me what she thinks I should spend my money on and it's frustrating when I say I don't want to cause she always tells me I have more money than her, I can afford it, I should spend that money I worked so hard to build up and save.

1st realization: we were on vacation at my grandmother's house and I assumed we would be leaving by a certain time cause that's what I was told. We would be driving 16+ hours to get back home and I wanted to have ample time to sleep before I had to go to work the day after the next. Well, when I found out we were leaving much later, I was worried and upset we wouldn't get home in time for me to get enough sleep for work or that'd I have to call off an extra day last minute. When I expressed I was upset about that, my mother proceeded to tell me I don't get to act shitty/feel shitty about the situation because my grandmother wanted to prepare a meal for us before we left which, im fine with cause I love her cooking. I just didn't enjoy the fact that I was told last minute and now I had to worry about time and work a little extra now. She yelled at me and told me I'm acting shitty and it wasn't a set time anyways and I need to get off my attitude. I got even more upset and ran inside after getting loud along with her. I told my grandmother everything and she agreed my mother wasn't the best and if I ever need to talk or vent, I could call her and she could help me as best as she could.

2nd experience: Tom Thumb was having a buy 2 ice creams for $7 deal and I had to partake. I was gonna buy it for myself but when I got to the check out with my mom in tow, she offered to help me and buy it for me. I accepted and once the week had passed, I finished one off and planned to eat the other one the Monday of the next week coming up so I'd have something to look forward to when I got home from work. My stepdad ate all of it in one night and I told him it was mine. He said he'd pay for it. A week goes by and he never bought it. I brought it up and he was pissed about it. My mom butt in and told him that actually, she had bought the ice cream and my stepfather didn't need to pay for it, therefore, it was not mine and they aren't gonna buy me a new one since they already paid for a new one. I was upset because, yes, they did technically buy it but it was mine, regardless of who bought it. I was upset to hell and back so I was gonna run to my room but my mom quipped back with a snide comment,"" yeah. Run up to your room and figure out why you're upset!"" I wasn't sure what to even say or do so I curled up in my brothers truck (the trunk) and called my grandmother for awhile till it was dark out. This lead to a night where I was leaving for a friend's house with ice cream I BOUGHT this time. I jokingly said ""how about I take one your ice creams, [stepdad's name]?"" He proceeded to say ""yeah. Sure. But I'm taking yours if you do."" So I replied
""You already took one of mine. You can't just take another one. That's not fair.""
And he started getting pissed off cause I brought up the ice cream issue again.
He told me, along with my mom, ""I pay for this house and the roof over your head. As a matter of fact, hardly anything in this house is yours at all.""
I brought up every Christmas, every clothing item, every piece of technology, poster, every snack, pair of shoes, purses, books/ etc that I bought in this house and that were gifted to me by a family member that wasn't them. I had even bought the dog blankets and one of our dog's beds. I've paid for their haircuts and nails to get done before too. He responded with same line ""very little in this house is yours."" Which aggravated me. I dont remember exactly what I said but I replied mocking towards him and my mother and insulted them in some (not by calling them names but in a way that hurt their pride. I've never called them names in an argument ever.)
I rushed out of the front door to my friends car with the snacks and my overnight bag and just told her to drive. That apparently really upset my stepdad for once Which I wasn't aware of and from my mother's words ""we were just messing around and joking with you. You're the one who took it too far!"" She says that and yet she belittled me and made a snide comment and made me buy myself 2 new things of ice cream. She saw that I had done that and commented that she was gonna buy them for me. She only said that because she saw I bought them. She wasn't going to buy them for me. She forgets everything regarding me unless I remind her or do it my fucking self which I usually end up doing. She guilt tripped into feeling bad for spending my money on a treat I wanted for myself so I can have a reward to look forward to when I get home. 

3rd experience: we were on my way back from work and I finally broke down after stress cause I mentioned the ice cream incident and the reason I wasn't going to ask my stepdad for anything anymore since earlier that morning he said ""oh you're finally asking for shit now?"" Like I don't previously ask for things already.(I have to put my name on the things I buy because I can't trust someone not to eat it. No one will buy it for me later if they eat it bc they always have to bring up the fact that they pay the bills and keep the roof over my head)
My mom blamed me for the entire ice cream incident all because I took everything too far when, in reality, im tired of just glossing over things with her and letting her get away with saying mean shit to me bc she wants to hold power over me in some way. My grandmother helped and told me I need to stand my ground with her. Talk things out and let her know when she's saying something that's bullshit.
I broke down and yelled at her about it, about how she does this shit all the time. She buys things for us to be nice then throws them back in our face by saying ""So I can just take back that Nike jacket right? And all those Christmas gifts? Since you wanna be shitty to me, right?"" She threatens to take stuff back or remove them or whatever. She denied it. She denied everything brought up because my voice cracking, my emotions were out of control and I was having a mental breakdown in the car sobbing uncontrollably. I brought everything she did that wronged me or fucked up my life in some way (she's not physically abusive...just verbally or mentally manipulative and so on.) She denied everything. Turned the conversation around on me and blamed me and said I had been acting ungrateful towards her and making her feel like shit for the past 2 weeks as if she didn't make me feel like shit for years. 2 weeks is nothing. I realized when I was in therapy, she was the reason for me getting into therapy. She was the soul problem in my life. Unfortunately I had to cancel future appointments due to quitting my awful job and the price going up.
She tried to say ""If you want me to fix things or work on things, you need to work with me! You need to communicate with me! Tell me what's wrong!""
I told her I didn't want to. I was tired of trying.
At one point she said ""I'm the parent!!! Regardless of the situation, I deserve respect!!""
I replied
""Thats an excuse! You're using this as an excuse to be a horrible person!""

After I said I didn't want to work out things with her 
She threatened/blackmailed me.
""Well if you wanna use this car to get yourself to work instead of using uber, you're gonna have to communicate with me!""
I pointed out she was blackmailing/threatening me as soon as she finished and she denied it.
""No I'm not! Thats not what I said at all!""

As soon as we got home, I ran inside, threw my things on a table and ran out of the house all the way to my friends house, hiccuping, sobbing and red faced. I didn't come home for 2 days. I told her over text that I wanted to talk like adults not ""parent and child"" and I wanted to be respected. I wanted to be able to finish my sentences without being cut off or talked over. I wanted an apology and I wanted her to think about her actions and words as well like she always raised me to do when I've hurt my friends or upset them.
The reason I had brought that up was because my grandmother had told me to tell her where I was. I did cause my grandmother hasn't wronged me. My mom replied with ""thank you ❤""  which pissed me off cause she always does this after we get into a fight. She tries to act innocent and sweet to patch things up and make me wanna apologize like it's nothing or tell her I love her or whatever to make her feel better about the whole situation.
I sent her the paragraph that I wanted to talk as I stated above ^ and she just said ""I'm sorry you feel upset. But we can talk as long as you don't bring up the past.""
I replied firmly, ""no. I'm allowed to bring up the past because you still treat me the same way as in the past. Nothing has changed. And don't apologize for my emotions. Apologize for your actions. That's what a proper apology is. That's what you taught me. Think about that and we can talk tomorrow.""

We didn't end up talking because I stayed at my friends house later than expected bc I was getting anxious about going home. When I finally went home, things went as if nothing had happened. 

4th, most recent experience: tonight I was forced to clean up after dinner even though I helped cook. My mom said ""you didn't clean the last two nights. You brother cleaned the entire kitchen the night before and last night your sister did it by herself! It's your turn to clean!""

The night before, I had gotten home after being yelled at by my supervisor all day and I had a pinched nerve in my back from being bent over all day cleaning (part of my job to clean all day). I was too tired to clean up and in too much pain.

Last night, my mom bought fast food for everyone but me because I said I'd eat out. The only thing my sister had to clean up was her own damn food. She didn't clean up the whole kitchen. She just threw her food away and that was it. 

I didn't bring that up because I was getting pissed off.
Usually I have to call my sister or brother to help me clean up the kitchen so its not just me but my mom always gives them a pass not to help out. It frustrates me because just as much as my brother has a job and my sister has school, I also have a job too. Its just as tiring and I'm getting yelled at or forced to rush my work all day in the heat as well.
I couldn't be more pissed off with her so finished the kitchen, clearly making a racket with how pissed I was and she yelled at me to stop acting pissed off about the situation then I went upstairs. She came in later and said the same line she always says if we get into a fight before we all settle down for bed
""Goodnight. I still love you though.""
Followed by either
""Even if you dont love me back.""

""Even if you don't think I do.""

And sometimes she'll try to hug me and I'll push her off and deny her which only makes her more upset because she so desperately wants me to apologize and pretend nothing happened and to forgive her as if she didn't say the meanest shit to me/about me.

She does this constantly and always the same way. I've memorized it at this point and I always expect it when I hear her coming up the stairs. I even know what her footsteps sound like. 

Other experiences: she'll invite me out with her to places where she plans to buy things and she won't tell me I'm paying for myself till I'm checking things out. She does it all the time when we go to get our nails done. She doesn't tell me till we get there that I'm paying for myself but when I deny that I don't wanna pay for something I can do at home she'll say ""all that money you have. You can afford it. But be stingy."" She sometimes even tells me I should buy certain things or tells me I should get things that I wasn't even looking to invest in or buy for myself. She always brings up how I have the money for it but I'm saving as much of money for my future car and the future college and apartment when I move out cause I'm sick of living here and being treated like this. 
Spent a couple of my high school summers watching my sister and I was never allowed to even step foot outside. Not for the mail. Not to sit in the backyard. Not to sit on the front porch/front steps. Not to even walk the dog. I was slowly getting more and more depressed. I was mentally spacing out more and more where I felt like I wasn't even mentally clocked in whenever I was awake during those couple months. It felt like I was in autopilot. I wasn't even allowed to sleep in bc anything could happen to my sister while I'm sleeping. When all she did was sit on her phone or watch YouTube. 
She would always tell me I'm not allowed to be upset about it bc at least she paid me for it and my sister is my responsibility (when I had a brother who could watch her just fine too). She said she should be making me watch her for free since I'm sister and this is what I'm supposed to do but ""she's being nice and paying me."" Sometimes she'd pay me by getting me a bag of chips I wanted. I'd sometimes ask her if she could get me a small bag of chips and she'd say that was my allowance for the week and if I really wanted it then she could do that but she wouldn't pay 20. Which was fucking ridiculous because a small $1 bag of chips doesn't have the same value as $20 for watching and working like a babysitter. I told her about this too and she denied it. Said my sister called her crying bc she didn't know where I had gone when I'd tell her I'm walking the dog or just sit on the porch right by the front door. She'd still cry and scream even when I did leave the house and call my mom crying and screaming about it. Then my mom would come home later and yell at me about it or call me and yell at me.
Before I realized I can't actually talk to her about my problems, I tried to tell her about them and she always told me I'm not allowed to be upset or feel a certain negative emotion/""act shitty"" because whatever I'm upset about is my responsibility and I should just figure out how to deal with it or stop crying because it's such a small thing to be upset over.

And I swear she judges me on what I wear and the jobs I get and how I need to power through shitty jobs for the money. I dont like working for people who don't give me enough hours or treat me like shit/yell at me on a constant basis when I'm giving my all and doing my best as it is. 

Another thing, I try to show my gratitude to her for letting me use her car so much and ""keeping a roof over my head and letting me live rent free at home."" By paying for the dogs important things like food, nail trims, haircuts, treats, shots, etc. Getting gas as often as I can. Occasionally going out of my way to get her a coffee/food just to be nice and helping her out/cooking for her or walking the dogs/helping out with my sister and so on but she likes to call me ungrateful all the time. I even try to tell her verbally that I appreciate what she ""does"" for me/etc. Still told I'm ungrateful.
She also likes to talk over me alot or cut me off when I try to stand my ground or genuinely speak to her over something she said.

I'm sorry this was so long but I don't have anywhere else to get this out at and I saw this thread and kinda just...immediately went to venting.

A random person in the store complemented my eyes and I just kept waiting for the “but” and eventually started weeping when I realised they were being genuinely kind to me.

I used to come here four years ago when I went through an estrangement with my parents. I went from one emotionally abusive relationship into the next. I got engaged after 2.5 years of dating and my relationship got so much worse. I left him after 4 years, once I was close enough to graduating and had the financial means to do so. I went to DBT therapy for help because he and my BPD sister and my abusive parents made me think I had BPD. (Heads up. I went to 6 weeks of therapy with DBT to be told I definitely don't have a personality disorder by specialists who specialize in personality disorders.) I am so fiercely depressed but it hits me in big crashes. I am okay for a while and then I get smashed down. Now that we broke up my ex admits (kind of) that he manipulated me to get what he wanted (then sometimes he says he never did that). He hints that I was naive about men and about people. He always told me that people only mean me harm. Sad thing. I used to believe in people. I used to think he was flawed for not trusting anyone and being so standoffish to the point where he was abusive and couldn't open up. After how he treated me though, I don't trust anymore. I think he's kind of right. People just want to use you for what they can most of the time. I don't want anyone because I am so scared I'll be mistreated again. I have trouble talking about this without making light of it but he pressured me into sex often. He was mean to me and started to treat me differently when I didn't want it. Even though I love him and see the good parts of him. I really struggle to say this but he raped me. When I say that I feel like I'm betraying him. He knew I didn't want to. I said I was tired. I said I didn't want to. But he did it anyway ""hoping I would get into it."" And later when I asked him why he said ""I guess I just wanted what I wanted. And sometimes alpha mentality makes you take what you want."" And now we stay friends because I don't even know why I can't leave the relationship fully. And while he has been good to me so far as a friend (kinda).. I feel he still manipulates me. I feel embarrassed that I continue to be around him and I feel I still can't bring myself to tell him I don't want him around because honestly, I do want him around. Why? Why do I still want him around? Why? I apologized to my parents (I felt badly for them because of the lives that made them into narcs) and now we have VLC because I learned DBT skills to cope and because I feel guilty and bad for them because they didn't have easy lives. I believe people are very complex and I see all of the forces acting on them to make them into themselves and I don't know whether they can be held accountable or not and I struggle. And I try so hard to be decent. I try so hard not to step on toes or hurt anyone. I am just so devastated. Why do the people I love the most treat me so much worse then I would ever treat them?

My parents moved a lot and so my Nmom would tell me not to get comfortable in school or bother to make friends because we would move. Jokes on her I was always bullied and had no friends even when I tried. 

And when we finally settled down somewhere and I was in middle school and started to make some friends. She always spoke terribly about them or said some racist bs. If none of those things worked she would say, well none of this matters because we plan to go back to (third world hone country) we are just here to make money and leave. So in the back of my mind I just was never sure. We have large extended family there and I always thought it was possible. 

Fast forward almost two decades!!!!!! And I recommend to my Nmom that we all just move back to (home country) because I got to live there for a year and honestly thought it wasn’t so bad. 

Her reaction: starts hysterically laughing. Looks at me with disgust saying “we would never move back there, (home country) is disgusting and has disgusting people. You’d never survive long term. Keep those ridiculous ideas to yourself.”

I think this line is very important to us because no matter what household you come from, I am proud you were created. Its hard unlearning something you hardly know is wrong and trying to learn a right that you were taught nothing about. But you'll be okay. Which leads to the next song.

The next song is one from a series called Helluva Boss (Its messed up and if you're religious it won't make you comfortable maybe, idk. But its also funny so.)
This song is about a father telling his child that even if they're gone they will be okay. So even though you may feel like an orphan in your own house, you will be okay when your parents/toxic family members are out of your life. 
You will survive this. Choose your mental health over this toxicity, you've been sacrificing yourself for so long because of it now.

What do you expect me to do?! It's just their own form of mental illness. They don't understand what they're doing. They don't mean any harm. 

YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRUST - It doesn't matter what's actually happened, what matters is that you don't know how to trust. All of this is because of that, not because of our actions. If you could just learn to trust, you'd see that we aren't really doing or saying any of these things to you.

I'm ashamed to say that it made me feel really guilty whenever I was proven wrong by anybody. If someone proved me wrong about something, I'd usually just shut down completely.

I don’t know if it’s like love bombing since it’s only been about 3 times in 3 years and she never sends a message along or anything. They are usually just small things she’s found that she thinks I’d like I guess. 

Lately I’ve been feeling sentimental and missing her. The good parts of her. The bad parts of our relationship are so overwhelmingly bad though and have caused so many issues that I’ve been working on in therapy for a year. 

I know she hasn’t changed because my siblings have told me how she treats them. Even the golden child of the family has to deal with her narcissistic tendencies. 

But I have recently decided I wanted to go to cosmetology school which was a dream of my nmom’s when she was younger. I thought it might be nice if we did it together, maybe i could help her get started and it would be an experience to bond us and her getting to reach a goal she always wanted might help her heal from the traumas that make her the way she is. 

But I also feel like I’m being delusional and the moment I reach out to her it will just open a door for more pain and set back the progress I’ve made in therapy.

My parents never loved me. I'm sure all of you experienced the same thing. My mother viewed me as a lapdog that she grew sick of the moment I learned I didn't have to be attached to her. My father viewed me as an embarrassing burden on his life that he never wanted. He told me as much. 

I grew up with no love. I wasn't allowed to have friends as a child. I suspect many of you grew up the same way. 

I didn't experience real, genuine love for the very first time until I was 14. 

I had a girlfriend, I'll just use her name because there's nothing else identifying about her in this story, her name was Kayla. 

Kayla and I had a tumultuous relationship, I was extremely messed up mentally and emotionally, and honestly, she was too. I didn't know what love was, I didn't know what it felt like, i didn't know how to express it. I knew nothing about it.

She watched me suffer for over a year, trying her best to support me. I was very unappreciative of her support, but I've tried my best to make up for it since then. 

Anyway, the first act of love. 

When I was 14, I was on the brink of ending my life. I was so exhausted from the loveless, abusive, horrifying life I was forced into. She had supported me for so long, at that moment she realized that I needed help beyond what she had to offer.

So, as I was contemplating the end, she called a social worker, told her about my situation, and the social worker showed up to my front door. 

Under threat of CPS involvement, my parents begrudgingly had me admitted into a psychiatric hospital, where I stayed for nearly 2 months. 

I call this an act of genuine love because Kayla knew how much I would resent her for this. I dreaded and despised the idea of going to one of those hospitals, I'd avoid it at all costs. She knew this, she knew I would hate her for making that decision, but she made it anyway.

She loved me in a way no one else ever had in that moment. She chose my safety and well-being over me liking her, over our relationship. She made an impossibly hard decision and she did it because she wanted me to be safe more than she wanted to be in a relationship with me. 

I was 14, she uprooted my life more than anyone else had before, and for a while, I did resent her for it. I wasn't mentally stable enough or emotionally mature enough to give her the credit she deserved, so her doing this did destroy our relationship. We didn't speak for nearly three years.

Her decision was based entirely on love, but it did damage my life severely. 

I disappeared from school for 2 consecutive months. My school counselor did everything the state said they could to help me recover from it, but ultimately my GPA dropped from a 3.8 to a 2.4, just from the sheer amount of schoolwork I missed. Catching up was just about impossible. 

And honestly, a 2.4 GPA is extremely hard to recover from. So my performance in school fell apart when I got back. I gave up on the idea of college because my transcript was beyond fucked before I even got to Sophomore year. 

When I came back to school, everyone had questions. I disappeared for two entire months without a word, people wanted to know, and I didn't have a story to tell them. 

Eventually I confided in someone the real reason I was gone, and like a wildfire, word got out that I spent a long time in the psych hospital. So suddenly it was like I was a plague victim. No one wanted to be near me. They thought I was crazy. I lost all my friends (never got them back), I struggled to make new ones because everyone just viewed me as the kid who spent 2 months in a crazy people hospital. I never really did make new friends after that. I was alone the rest of high school, and yeah, a lot of it was from the bitterness. I was bitter. Who wouldn't be? 

But the most damaging part of it all, all the walls I had built up to protect myself from my parents, they were gone. Completely gone. And on top of that, now my mother had more ammo to use against me than she ever had before, and she still uses it to this day.

Anytime I said anything she didn't like, anytime I questioned her or criticized anything she said or did, it was ""Is this you talking or the mental illness talking?""

Every time i expressed an ounce of unhappiness at anything, whether intentional or not, it was ""don't take it out on me just because *you're* mentally ill""

She would make a point to go into my room every couple weeks and ask ""so.... are you still crazy or has that gone away yet?"", the exact words she used. She did this every few weeks for 3 years. 

Anytime I was unhappy, anytime I didn't like something, anytime I protested, anytime I did or said ***anything*** that she wasn't favorable of, it was ""this isn't you, you're just sick.""

One decision fucked up my life so fucking badly. 

And that decision was the very first act of genuine love I ever had in my entire love.

Can you imagine how complicated of a feeling that is?

The *first time anyone ever loves me*, and it ***destroys*** me. 

Kayla and I made amends some while ago, and I still send her a text every few weeks to let her know that I appreciate her. She was honestly the first person in my life to ever actually love me, and I'll never forget that.

She sends packages of random gifts to our house for my daughter. 

Backstory:

We originally decided to go NC with my nmom because she undermined us as parents and was trying to raise our daughter to be like herself and my sister - the golden child. She acted as if she and I were divorced parents and she was the one who could decide how our daughter would be raised. She has never accepted my boyfriend as a father to our daughter because he is not her biological father even though he has been her only father figure and has been since she was almost 3yo. She used to take our daughter for the weekends but then our daughter would come back and behave horribly at our house and was not developing a sense of self, acting instead like a carbon copy of my nmom and gc sister. She would have extended family visit and would not tell us and instead do activities with the extended family acting as though she was our daughter's mother (which is how her side of the family treats them - we do not exist apparently). Any time she would invite us to do something with them as well it was always only to use our car or because she wanted us to help with  -do all of-  some sort of manual labor while they hung out. She would ignore basic safety such as requiring our dauhgter to wear a seatbelt on ""short drives."" She also constantly threatened to call the cops on me for the welfare of our daughter if we would not meet up exactly when she wanted for her to take our daughter for the weekend. 

Before we decided to go NC, I did try to talk to her over the phone about the issues we were having but instead of listening and trying to work on a solutions she decided to attack me as a daughter and as a mother before screaming profanities at me and hanging upon me. We then told her she could only visit our daughter at our house, not keep her overnight or take her out without us. She would not acknowledge the conversation after and temporarily said she needed to remove herself from our lives. This was when we saw a HUGE positive change in our family structure and our daughter's behavior so we decided that we wanted to continue NC instead of LC. She has since threatened to take us to court for grandparent's visitation rights, but it has been a month since she was supposed to have filed and I have not been served so I am hoping that it was either just a threat or she didnt have enough of a case to take me to court.

Same goes for everything else I wanted to try out when I was younger. It always felt like a burden for her 'spend extra' on me. And again, always telling us to think that we're poor, because she's a single parent. (Despite that, she still overspends on groceries, buys expensive makeup, gadgets, and prioritizes travel to expensive countries at least once a year). 

Come to think of it, we weren't poor. She's just not good with money. She just didn't want to spend on things she didn't feel like spending on.

My cousin didn't invite my mom to his wedding because his dad apparently told him not to. Anyhow my grandparents are living in the same town and my cousin and his wife are in town visiting and my dad wanted me to go visit them. So my mom pretty much does not want me going to my grandparents place because they treated her like crap and my uncle said shit about her (which she found out by putting recorders in my dads car). I mean fair but that is their fight. On the other hand my dad gets pissed if I don't go, he's like you've been so brainwashed by your mom. It's a lose-lose situation either way, so I figured why not just go and show them that I'm not gonna resort to my family's level of pettiness that I will go out of formality and politeness, truth be told I could not give a less sh\*t about anyone in my family. I would rather just live a quiet life without talking to family members, although unfortunately I decided to come home from uni for the summer to save money (and maybe there was a part of me that thought I would be able to cope with the emotional abuse of my parents, yes ik it was the wrong choice). I don't wanna be on anyones bad side so I just gotta navigate through it til I can leave in 2 weeks. It's just so frustrating. 

In the past I've pretty much lied by omission by not telling my mom that I'm going to my grandparents place. She finds out anyways somehow. She once confronted me and was like why didn't you tell me? And I was like you usually have a bad reaction when I tell you and then she was like oh so now you lie to me, who knows what else you've lied about (I mean quite a bit lmao). But then she completely denied that she had a bad reaction and was like i didn't get angry that you told me. Hooray gas lighting! So I was like ok this time I will tell her before going- she definitely had a bad reaction. She started calling me names, said ok now they've managed to sway you to their side (my dads side, I've definitely told her I'm neutral and not taking anyones side but its like talking to a wall), like you're completely cut off from me I don't wanna talk to you ever again, and started banging her head against the wall. And honestly I just felt so disconnected emotionally and for the first time in a long time her messed up behaviour didn't bother me. If anyone it solidified my choice to go because I wanted to show her hey you can't do all this crap and then expect me to fold and do whatever you want. Like you can't control me by doing that. It was a relief because I was kind of saying screw you to mom and releasing some of her hold over me. 

But now she's giving me the silent treatment and I'm definitely not gonna fold and apologize to her. And I quite frankly am tired of being the only one that tries with my parents. I have repeatedly told them both that if you gotta problem with me, just sit down and calmly talk it out with me and that silent treatment solves nothing.  I've been clear with my needs and wants but they don't really respect them. It's their way or no way. I also won't be coming back next summer or again unless it's to visit for a long weekend or something. I am done with my parents, they either try to meet me halfway or lose me.

Here is a recap - Narcissist mom (now aptly nicknamed smalltownfrown) favours my sibling and her kids over me and my child. Lots of previous events I could share but this is the latest.   smalltownfrown constantly travels to see my sibling and babysit and spend time with her kids but almost never comes to see my husband and I and our son. smalltownfrown just spent a week at lake with my sibling and her kids. smalltownfrown - “I’d like to come see you in August cuz I never see you guys. Only these days work. If a weekend then these 3 days” (guilting starts)
Me - “ok yes it would be best if it’s a weekend as we are busy at my work right now”.
smalltownfrown - “can’t you take time off? I am sure they owe you a day or three” (laying on the guilt)
Me - “ok I will try to see if I can take the Friday off for you”

So I go ahead and request the day off and about a week later smalltownfrown goes.
“Hey there, looks like we are getting company on that Friday and it won’t work out”
Me - “I already took the day off work. Company? Who is coming?”
*long silence*
smalltownfrown - sibling and kids are driving through town
Me - but didn’t you just spend a week at the lake with them? 
smalltownfrown - *long rambling text message of excuses*
Me - now upset and decided not to reply. Husband is also pissed as we had previously cancelled plans so JNMom could spend time with our son that specific weekend. 
A couple days pass. 

smalltownfrown - “Still ok for me to come Saturday?”
Me - (now feeling like someone’s back up plan) “we have plans”
smalltownfrown - “So… not a good time?” (Adds extra layer of guilt and sets up “excuse” narrative for herself to use later on)

No contact for days when they decide to post some passive aggressive jabs at me on social media. The craziest one stated “Dear Adult Children, Your Parents Don’t Owe You Anything. Here is the reality: our parents are getting older with each passing day. They will not be here forever. Instead of being a constant source of stress and drama, we should be the ones lightening the load for them. They have already done their jobs in raising us. It’s ok to ask for and accept help but to act as if we are owed something is dysfunctional and manipulative. It is time to grow up. “ 

So no text messages and don’t hear from her in weeks when the doorbell rings at 3:30pm on Friday. Here SmallTownFrown and my father come stomping in. I’m in my PJs and recovering from a headcold, not exactly wanting guests. Husband is at work and son is at daycare.     Yet here we are forced into an awkward situation again! Ofcourse she uses my father as a ply for sympathy to let her in. No boundary recognition and a sense of entitlement. I panic text my husband as the last thing I want is to be cornered and try to guilt me.

Both their mom and mine are mentally abusive beyond belief. Everything is about appearance - curated by them and how dare the child wants to express themselves in their way. Every damn thing is criticized from looks, hobbies and hell down to how we breathe!!

It sucks. I have not outright said to SK about narcissistic parents because that just doesn't feel right. I support them, say I'm sorry they have to go through everything and to know they have done nothing wrong. 

At the same time, having to help a child with this is wearing me down. It's becoming fight or fight in my mind - after SK cries about their nmom I shake and will privately cry later. It's almost like rehashing and reliving all the crap I went through. I did not want a life that I finally escaped to have a woman that's a clone of my nmom that gets to inject herself in my household for so many years. Seeing a child cry for the same reasons I did.

I spoke to my wife about this and she suggested I put something up here.

I came out to my family as transgender about 2 months ago.  
The journey for me started about 12 months ago and has been an extremely difficult time as you can imagine.

Yesterday, I invited my mum over for coffee.  
I try to see her every couple of weeks otherwise she starts to get a bit... weird.  
I would personally be fine without seeing her for extended periods but she is not like that, so I try to accommodate.

We were sitting at my dining room table discussing various things and I mentioned that I was having a good day, and had a good week. The first time in a while I have felt consistently good about myself.

She honestly didn't seem to care a lot that this was the case, and stopped and said ""I need you to know that I am still struggling a lot with this"".

I stared at her... thinking \*What am I supposed to do with that?\*

She asked ""Do you understand why I need you to know this?"" - most likely in response to my extremely puzzled expression.

I said ""....kinda?"" (really, no... I didn't)

She said that she needed me to know this because she wants me to help her through it and comfort her.

I understand the sentiment, but this really hurt me and it hurts more the more I think about it.

Being trans is HARD. There's a lot more bad days and emotional turmoil than any good days or happy moments. But to me it seems like just because I seem to be doing OK, she can turn that around and use it as an opportunity to put the spotlight back on herself.

I don't think it's fair to ask the person that is most affected by a situation to comfort you and make you feel all warm and fuzzy about it.  
I totally get that she would be having a hard time, but I don't think it's my job to help fix that. I see a therapist to help me through this rather than leaning on people around me that are also affected, and I suggested to her that she do the same.  
She didn't seem very happy with that idea.

Am I over-reacting? Mum has a history of this sort of thing and I feel like this is just another huge step in the narcissistic march she is getting really good at...

My girlfriend starting coming over for only a couple months in 2018 then My parents told me that she can no longer stay the night . Which I thought was strange considering the fact we still went places and talked still. We don’t have a huge gap in our age . I am 20 now and my girlfriend is 24 . I did move out the end of 2019 and spent a lot of time with my girlfriend and her side of the family . not  Necessarily with my family because me and my girlfriend was always together . So if I would come over to my side of the family she wouldn’t be able to come inside so she would be in the car . This went on for the first half of our relationship . They would not speak to her at all which they did before. when I came out to my parents I didn’t get the greatest response . My mom said “  I have opened myself up to the devil &amp; sent me multiple bible scriptures . My Father said he figured it out and he hates my decision and that he is not proud of my decision . He said he doesn’t want my girlfriend around my sisters because he doesn’t want them seeing me with a girl is okay . Right then and there I should have said okay then I won’t come around because we are together . It doesn’t stop there . There a was a situation  months later where my mother feels as if my girlfriend disrespected her because my mother wasn’t listening to me( which has always been the issue even before my girlfriend came into the picture) so my gf basically said how she doesn’t listen to me and don’t get treated the same . My mom was so stuck on how does she know about the favoritism and shit. so of course I confided in my gf. On my graduation I almost didn’t get to walk because my mom was getting her nails done and time was cutting close .it was like she didn’t take it serious . When it came to my younger sister competition or practices being late is out of the question . So I have express this to my girlfriend . So she knew how I felt about my parents not listening to me and not receiving the same treatment as my siblings . She called my girlfriend a manipulator a devil multiple times. My mom called my dad and showed up not listening to anything I had to say he man handled me and threw me in the car and drove off . because Ihave never seen my parents completely out of character and took me away from my girlfriend . I was freaking out trying to explain to my dad what happened . He completely shut me down from trying to explain to him what happened and said he will take me back to the hospital if I continued .( that day I was released from the hospital from  trying to commit Suicide the main reason was them not accepting me and they were FULLY AWARE of tha ) he drove me to my grandma house and she made me read bible scriptures basically trying to push me to believe being gay isn’t right . They took my phone and car because they felt like  “they were trying to protect me “. Still to this day they feel like they were just trying to protect me .because I was weak and not in  my right mind .

It took up until 2018 for me to realise I was living in survival mode due to what I had experienced throughout childhood and into adulthood. This realisation happened because in the Spring of 2018 I finally reached out to mental health intake services in my town and started attending regular sessions with a CMHW (community mental health worker) and a few sessions with a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with severe depression, and cyclothymia.

Fast forward a few years and I'm ready to live a life that I'm content with. The only thing is... I'm not sure how to go about doing that. I didn't even know about the whole shampoo-conditioner thing until someone posted about it in this subreddit a week or two ago. One thing I know for sure is that I don't like where I live right now and have very little enthusiasm about returning to my hometown. Lots of my friendships have faded away and I'm pretty much estranged from my mom's side of the family.

My mother is the main narcissist parent who’s made this decision, despite the fact that I have told her I have no interest in a visit.

I explained that idea to him about how she weaponizes people I care about and other reasons why it would be a bad idea. He doesn’t argue with me or push me to introduce him, but he doesn’t really seem to get why it’s such a bad idea.

NSFW because I mention sex, I'm not sure if it's needed, but I thought it would be best to put just in case.

I am 20 years old, and my mom continuously gets upset over me placing boundaries. Recently, she has been obsessing over my sex life. She told me she was losing sleep over thinking about it. She didn't catch me in the act of anything, she just made assumptions and thought too much about me hanging out with friends. She also stalked my bank account and figured out payments were from a *certain popular adult site*, and has been accusing me of not deleting the account when I told her I did delete it. She says she can ""find out"" if I still have the account and was talking about hiring a private investigator to find it. The account had nothing to do with my friends, but she then accused me of being a prostitute--when I am not. 

A month ago she told me I needed to be given as much psychiatric medication as possible just because I enjoyed sex. Yes, that was the reason. Each sentence around that statement was regarding my sex life, so it couldn't have been for any other reason. It was all while she was yelling at me when I just got off of a night shift at work. She insisted that I shouldn't have sex ever. I had only been seeing one person the whole time and I saw them once a month. She was saying extremely paranoid things that night (claiming my ex killed children?). She screamed at me to pack my shit and leave, but when I did, she screamed at me that I wasn't allowed to move out. She told me that anyone who says they'll help me will only use me and that any man that talks to me is just going to use me for sex. She insists that I'll get kidnapped for walking around during the day and looks at local missing persons almost everyday. She thinks everyone is a sex-trafficker and there's no way to reason with her. She worries about pedophiles targeting me even though I'm 20 and I do not look like a child. She tells me that I'm easy to manipulate and thinks everyone I talk to has it out for me... She accused my coworkers of talking smack about me, when my coworkers are all grown adults with children.

She does not have any friends, she does not have a boyfriend, she doesn't even have an ex-husband. She doesn't go to work. I don't know what to do for her. 

I've tried talking to my college's counseling service, but they couldn't really help me or give me advice. Every friend I've talked to has told me to get out of my home ASAP. I won't be able to pay for college if I leave and I never had a parent who could teach me about how to actually survive in the real world because she never wanted me to leave. (When I talked about adopting a kitten and taking the kitten with me when I moved out, she told me I wasn't moving out. Cats live up to 12 years, I would be 32 years old when the cat dies.) 

I have no idea what to do or where to go or what I even can do. The way she treats me makes me feel crazy, she's always talking about how no one else has good intentions for me and how everyone is lying to me. I am dealing with my own mental issues from years of abuse and I cannot be her best friend and her therapist. I'm scared to even make a second bank account to save money without her knowing because I don't want the mail to arrive to my house because she looks through my mail and packages. 

I really appreciate any sort of guidance or even just reassurance that I'm not insane for wanting to move out.

First time posting, but I need some support or advice.

Yesterday, my mother, younger sister and I (25 female) went to a water park together. The whole day, my mom would constantly bring up that I don’t talk to her much, but it’s her job as a mother to warn me about what the Bible says about my “lifestyle choices” (I’m lesbian for context). I kept telling her I didn’t want to talk about it, but she would loudly say “ok but just don’t be mad at me!”, so I felt very awkward as people started to stare at us. At one point I just said, “I don’t think the church would want someone like me.” To which she (again, loudly) said “what do you have against Christians?” 
She would then keep picking at my appearance, like “you know, you were prettier when your hair was longer”, “you should stop trying to be nerdy like your brother and just be yourself!”, or “you should really lose some weight”. At the end of the night, I was emotionally drained, and I felt like garbage. I talked to my best friend, and we decided that the best thing for me to do now is to cut contact with my mom, so I can finally focus on healing. 
I’m afraid she’s going to tell everyone how I’m such a “bad daughter” because I won’t talk to her, or that “the devil” convinced me to cut ties.

I have fibromyalgia from the fear and stress that she has put me through and drilled into my head. She made me get a dietitian and tested for any micronutrient deficiencies because she was convinced I had a vitamin deficiency. She bought me epsom salt and would sometimes make baths for me.

But the abuse and the small jabs and cuts and the severe fear she has instilled in me has been severe in my lifetime. I’ve had psychosis twice where I’ve tried to escape and both times she would just scream at me during my panic attacks. After going to the hospital and getting psychiatric help she wouldn’t let me leave the house for a month or drive and would act like a nurse withholding meds because ‘too much lorazepam is bad for your brain’. I was having panic attacks and having to beg her for my medication. I was 21.

Does she know the damage she has done or is she delusional? She helps pay for therapists and encourages me to go because she realizes I have anxiety but doesn’t realize it’s from her. She says I act like a moody teenager and that I’m rebelling. I have severe anxiety and ocd from the abuse. I self sabotage and am scared most of the time.

I’ve been trying to get out since I was 18 and didn’t even realize how severe and fucked up the abuse was.

Anyway.  The reason for this.  My sister, the GC, recently celebrated her birthday.  My mother posted on SM the following:  “Happy Birthday GC NAME, *my life’s greatest joy*”

Several years ago, she posted that GC was “the best daughter ever.”  💔

I'll be happy to have them invite their friends over and let them go out to spend time with others, because my parents would never let me go anywhere without terrorizing me about it for days in advance of and after the event. 


I'll give them physical affection like hugs (of course only with their consent), because my mom always used to push me away, and I don't accept my dad's hugs anymore because he hugs me and tells me he loves me one second, and literally throws me across the room the next. I will not have my kids feel so unhealthily needy of their friends' love and affection as i feel today, because they'll be getting lots of love at home. 

I'll let them have sleepovers, because the first time i had one was when i was 15, and the morning after my parents bombarded my phone, make me leave super early while all the other kids were allowed to go to the public pool together, and yelled insults at me over the phone to the point where i broke down crying at the train station. 


I will earn their respect and treat them like normal human beings, because my parents always automatically expected me to respect them after all the awful things they said to me.

 
I will acknowledge their problems and mental health and do my best to help them, because all my parents do while I'm having panic attacks (which they caused, by the way) was yelling at me to shut up and not be dramatic, laugh about and mimic the way i cried, and throw a pity party about how their life is so much worse. 


I'll teach them how to be independent and allow them to make independent choices at all ages, to the point of letting my toddler choose their own clothes, because due to my parents' sheltering and controlling i still don't know how to do basically anything on my own and highly depend on my friends at 17 years old. 


I'll give them constant reassurance, because i never got that and am needy for reassurance by everyone around me.

I'll talk to them in a normal tone no matter how upset they make me, because to this day i still get panic attacks from people shouting, and start shaking uncontrollably at every somewhat heated discussion, because my parents lashed out at every minor inconvenience i caused. 


My children will always feel like they can trust their mom with absolutely anything without fearing abuse, because all my parents taught me was how to make up lies on the spot, fearing another fight. 


I'll seek help for my own mental battles and not project my own feelings onto my children, because my mom always made me feel responsible for her ""miserable"" life, and I'm always the one comforting my dad after yet another fit he threw like the manchild he is, acting like i love and understand him, even though all i want to achieve is have him calm down and stop terrorizing my mom and siblings.


I will recognize when my partner is being abusive, and react in an appropriate manner, because my mother failed to do that for 18 years now. 


I will not enable abusive partners and always, always put my kids first, because instead of defending me against my dad, my mom joins in to yell shit at me.


No matter what happens, i will throw my own feelings aside and swallow my pride when my kids are having a problem, because my parents never seemed to care about me venting about my feelings, and keep yelling insults and one-upping me with their own problems.


I will admit my mistakes and apologize to my children for any wrongdoings on my side, because my parents feel too good for that and either laugh at me or worse when i do muster up the courage to demand an apology from them. 


I will make board game nights (which they won't be obliged to attend), because as long as I can remember i used to beg my parents to play games with me, which they obviously almost always declined. 


I will respect their privacy, because to this day my parents barge into my room without knocking and laugh at me when I ask them to.


I will give them space when they need it, because my parents keep guilttripping me for wanting alone time. 


I will keep every single thing they make, because my parents threw away my drawings from kindergarten, saying it didn't matter because they where ugly anyways. 


I won't get in my teenage kids' business as long as they let me know they're safe, because every somewhat nice, ""typically teenage"" thing i did was behind my parents' backs.


We will sit down to discuss problems, and I'll let them have their turn to tell their side of the story and express their feelings, because all my parents taught me about problem solving is yelling vile insults at each other until someone finally breaks.


I will keep my marriage/relationship problems between my partner and I, because some of the earliest memories i have is my parents hitting each other with our kitchen chairs and me picking up and handing my dad the wedding ring my mom threw across the room when i was no older than 4 or 5. And because of the fact that she still didn't leave him.



I will sit them down to explain to them WHY i don't want them to do certain things, because all my parents did was demonize and make a taboo out of everything remotely bad, which only made me more curious about them.


I will respect their belongings, because i still get insanely uncomfortable seeing damaged toys, because my mom used to rip apart my favorite plushies and break my toys when i didn't behave. 


I won't allow demonization of minorities in my household, and openly talk about and explain what discrimination, bullying etc is and why it's unacceptable, because my parents always tried to make me hate myself for being queer and having foreign friends.


I will make it clear that while school is a great tool for them to succeed later on in life, never will i make them feel like their academic successes define them, because ever since elementary school, my parents pressured me into succeeding, just so they could brag about it to their friends. I remember them telling me that me failing would ruin THEIR reputation all throughout elementary till now. 


While I'll show them my own morals and values, i will always reason my ways of doing things, while also letting them know that they can be whoever and however they want to be, because in the end it's their own life, and I'm just there to give them a good headstart and support them through everything. Because my parents teared me down for ANYTHING about me that differed from them, from wanting to adopt children rather than have biological ones, to being an atheist.


I will respect their career choices, because when i told my parents i wanted to be a therapist, they made fun of me whenever i showed any sign of emotional intelligence, or attempted to talk openly about how they made me feel (""oh so you're trying to be a psychiatrist to us now? Go talk about that psycho shit to someone else once you even get to that point, if you even get that far."" They still say ""psychiatrist"" even though I always corrected them to ""therapist"". Little things like this matter). When i then told them i wanted to be a teacher, they said similar things about how i was trying to teach them things and that i should ""know my place"" as the child.


And needless to say, no physical OR emotional abuse will ever be tolerated.


This got long, and it still doesn't even capture a fraction of what else i could talk about. And obviously most of these are the absolute bare minimum, and I'll do lots more. This was just a quick vent.

You get my point. 

Never, ever will my children have to feel like they have to hide ANYTHING from me. And never, ever will they feel like they have to walk on eggshells in my household, because i might lash out on them. Never.

She has a very unhealthy view of depression and I’m assuming she sees it in a “Hollywood” way where it only “counts” if you actively try to conceal it. 

My older sister fell sick with an eating disorder in her teens, and from that point forward my mom (covert narc) became overprotective of my sister and did anything and everything it took to make my sister’s life easier. It made this weird phenomenon happen where my mom decided I was “stronger” and “tougher” than my sister (I was four years younger) and I often had to give up things to make my sister happy, and just generally carry the emotional load, take care of my sister and protect her. Some family members started emotionally abusing me at the time, and my mom admitted a few years later that she never did anything about it because she was afraid if she protected me, they would go after my sister. 

I developed an eating disorder too, but over eating, not under eating, so my mom was largely unconcerned because she thinks it’s only a problem if you’re too thin and too depressed to eat.

Anyway, my sister tried to conceal most of her problems and hide her depression throughout that time, which made my mom obsessive with helping her, to the point of too strongly involving herself in my sister’s privacy, and also forcing her to go to therapy kicking and screaming. My sister is a grown adult now, much recovered, who my mom still thinks is too weak to function in this world. 

However, when I started developing all *my* problems as a teen, I could just never seem to get my mom’s attention for it. I wanted to be helped like my sister was. Instead, for example, my mom once caught me hurting myself, but she just got angry, screamed at me, and grounded me for it. Every moment of acting out just seemed to aggravate and annoy my mom further, but not make her worry about me. I suspect it’s because I was very outspoken that I needed help, which didn’t work in my mom’s book, because you have to not want people to know you’re depressed if you’re actually depressed. I had to beg to be taken to therapy. 

The title of this post happened when I was crying one night for over an hour after bedtime, and my mom pounded on my door and told me to shut up and that I was only doing it for attention. I tried to tell her I wasn’t, but she replied that she used to cry into her pillow as a teenager, but she did it so softly that no one could hear, because that’s what it actually means to be depressed. She could hear me, so it meant I didn’t actually need help. 

To this day, I still have imposter syndrome towards my own feelings. 

P.S. Nothing against my sister. I’m glad she got help and I genuinely think she needed it more.

He also never stood up for me, once I broke down crying in front of him ( for personal / family  conflict + I was older this time ) he just walked past me and didn't care. I witnessed him cheat on my mother on several occasions, even while once she was in a surgery. He treats his friends better than all of us, and only cares about himself.

For my daughter, they were horrible abusive things and she had no desire to put up with it. Makes sense since she wasn't trained and raised to accept it. I tried to set boundaries with my mom and it ended with mom cutting both of us out of her life because WE cause HER too much pain and grief and she ""deserved to enjoy her retirement and golden years"".

___

hello all, i’ve been a lurker on this sub for a long time. i’m 21F and i’ve had suspicions that my mother is a narcissist. i’m not a professional or anything and i don’t intend to diagnose her.

my mother has been single for most of my life, after my step-dad split when i was around 9. she dated for a while but now i think she’s finished with the dating scene.

i am not an only child but i have a large age difference with my sibling so i consider my experience to be similar. i have been anxious for most of my life. my mother is a very high-strung person. she is incredibly sensitive and defensive and does not do well in times of stress. i have always been the one cleaning up her messes, apologizing to store clerks after her public freak outs, trying my best to cool her down in the aftermath, and so on. my mother has said she doesn’t know what she’d do without me, she says it almost every day. it leaves me feeling almost paralyzed in living my own life. people ask what i’m doing with my life, or what i want to do…. and i just don’t know. i make things up on the spot just to keep the conversation flowing, because how do i explain that i have no drive to live my own life because i’ve lived most of it picking up my mother’s pieces? i’m fucking exhausted and i haven’t even really lived yet.

anyway- i would argue my mother is pretty smart, or at least somewhat intelligent. she has some interests that are intellectual and mature and she’s very knowledgeable when it comes to certain topics. however… she does this thing where she will sometimes sound like a child for no reason. it’s hard for me to even explain, but like, she will randomly put on the voice of a little kid. it could be for anything, at any time and anywhere. she will have a blank stare when i say something simple and respond like a child. it’s embarrassing when we’re in public and she suddenly starts acting like this but it’s mostly harmless and doesn’t last long. other times she will have full on tantrums and will scream and holler over small inconveniences. it’s impossible for me to get through to her when she’s like this, and if i do, it’s usually her just saying whatever it takes to shut me up. “yeah you’re right,” “ok i understand, stop yelling at me!” etc

my question: is there more to this that i’m missing? do these traits sound similar to those of true narcissists? or does she sound more like an adult with peter pan syndrome? is there much overlap here? fwiw, my mother does show signs of empathy, and it seems genuine to me but i’m not sure i can even trust my own judgment. she is generous to people on the street &amp; neighbors, she cries at sad movies, etc. idk. i know i’m rambling here but any insight is appreciated.

My mother has punished me without going out for ""ignoring"" her (that is, not telling her about my problems or what I do with my friends. Not engaging in conversations with them. And just saying good night when I get home after leaving.)

 So according to her she has had enough and this will not continue, and although she has not taken the phone from me yet, she has said that she will. 

When she realizes I'm not going to change she will getting worse, I don't have to tell her anything. She does not deserve it. And she will use the information against me: I made the mistake of told her that I drink alcohol in a party. 

And now, she said that I am a alcohol adict, which I'm not (Even I don't like the taste so I don't drink to much), and that I smoke weed (I never told her anything like that), lmao.

So, now, I won't say anything to her anymore.

She says I'm spiteful because I reminded her that she tried to choke me a few months ago. And that I am the aggressive one to defend myself, lmaooooooo. 

And when I made a post about this, many warned me that it could get worse, it hasn't. However, she said: In the end we will have to come to blows. Implicitly implying that something like this could happen again, I don't think it will happen, because social services warned her that they could send me to a juvenile center. 

Nmom, I'm not giving in and you can throw all the tantrums or punishments you want. I am not doing anything wrong, it is not my fault nor am I the one causing all this. I will not fall into Gaslighting again.

She told me that being pregnant almost killed my mother, that if it wasn’t for me she never would have developed a brain tumor; she would have been able to hold down a job; she would have stayed with my father; she wouldn’t be dependent on my grandmother; etc. Logically, I know this is all bullshit. My mother has never once made me feel like I was responsible for any of the things my grandmother claimed I was. Even when she talks about having to take a semester off from college because her pregnancy was hard on her. She takes every opportunity to tell me that I’m her whole world, and that none of those things are even close to being my fault. 

My mother was born with a neurological disability. My grandmother has spent her whole life perpetuating ableist rhetoric that my mother’s illness and subsequent comorbidities (dyslexia, anxiety/depression, chronic fatigue, weight gain, weak immune system, etc.) are a moral failing, and that if my mother would just listen to her and do what she says then she’d be “hEaLtHiEr ThAn A nOrMaL pErSoN.” This, in addition to saying that me being born did nothing but make her life infinitely harder.

So, because of this, my grandmother impressed on me that I should never have children. She insisted I do penance for the sin I committed by being born by never having children, lest I risk repeating my mother’s mistakes. Subconsciously, I’ve actively avoided anything related to babies or children or parenthood because the first comment out of my grandmother’s mouth would be, “YOU’RE not going to have children anytime SOON, are you?” Before going on a tirade about everything I’ve already mentioned. It went so far that when I had to start taking birth control at 16 (on a low, not-enough-to-prevent-pregnancy dosage) to treat my own chronic illness, my grandmother was convinced that I was lying and that I was intentionally asking for a low dosage so I could wind up pregnant. Even when I went to college, she would interrogate me about whether or not I was dating so she could catch me lying about being sexually active. 

It’s only now at almost 24 that I’m trying to be comfortable about the fact that, at some point in my life, I want to get married and have kids. Maybe not a bunch, but at least one! It’s a discomfort I had only just realized. My friend asked me, “Why do you always say ‘if’ you get married or have kids? I think you’d be a great mom!” That I actually stood back and thought about it.

The title really gets to the point, but if a little explaining helps feel free to keep reading. Essentially I'm just looking for tips or advice on no contact. I feel like I've been at the edge of no contact so many times and failed by giving in to quickly. But every time I do, the next flare up is 10x worse.

I want to go no contact with my mom. I want to really pull the trigger this time. I could probably write forever about every incident, but I won't. I'll just explain what feels like the final straw this time.

My mom has always had a problem with me making friends or relationships outside of my parents and brother (and to be honest, she doesn't like me having relationships with my dad or brother either). Always finding reasons someone wasn't good enough for me or convincing me I'm better off with just her and that our 'circle' (more like a line with only two points...me and her) is the only thing that matters in life. Fast forward to when I turned 19 and got the hell out of dodge and met my present day husband. He is amazing. My husband accepted my mom's crazy tendencies and comforted/supported me throughout everything. However, I can tell it definitely wears even him down. How could it not?

In my mom's usual fashion, she of course of the years tried saying things to convince me I should leave him. Anything from nitpicking his career choice, that he has two sons (now my step sons), he's 'too calm' to straight up fabricating lies. She's tried to convince me that she thinks he is cheating on me, doesn't love me or worst of all, she tried telling me she thinks that he is abusing our son (we have one child together on top of his two sons from a previous relationship). None of which she had any basis for. Just her suspicion or gut feeling. On top of all that, she constantly flirts with him by feeling his muscles and trying to touch him or a few Thanksgivings ago she even got drunk and took her shirt off in front of him in the other room claiming it to be an 'accident' (my husband immediately told me within seconds of it happening). Obviously, my mom has issues.

About 6 months ago she fabricated something new, told me that she thinks my husband is sexually assaulting our son. All because he had a rash on his bum when she was babysitting. I told her that is a very extreme accusation to make and that our 3 year old has been backtracking a bit with potty training (specifically #2) and sometimes he goes only a little bit and doesn't tell us (causing slight rashes). I told her I would not be having this conversation again and that I didn't want to hear her accusing my husband of something so horrible with no real basis. I know my husband and he wouldn't even hurt a fly.

She dropped the topic for awhile, but still pushed her luck by trying to bring it up 2 more times (my fault I know, I should have told her enough is enough sooner). Finally she brought it up again a couple nights ago (along with how she feels like I don't love her or spend enough time with her...which is intentional as I was trying to go 'low contact'). I basically said this is too much and that I don't want to have a relationship with her anymore. I can't keep listening to her fabrications and having 3-4 hours arguments on the phone 1-2 times a day. She literally takes up my whole life for days when she gets like this to the point that I just give in and try to smooth it over so I can move on and get back to focusing on work and my own household. She tried putting my dad on the phone to convince me I was wrong (her go to 'tap in' move when she feels like she is losing power), but I simply told him it's late and I have kids still awake because I've been neglecting them for this argument and I'm done. The next day she called and I ignored it because I was working (she doesn't understand the concept because she doesn't work and hasn't for decades). It felt so good to not pick up. Usually I always pick up because if I don't I have to hear her say 'What if I was dying? I knew you didn't love me.' and it always ensues an argument. When I didn't pick up, she immediately flooded my phone with text messages. Most of which I truly couldn't understand because she was just all over the place with her topics. But it felt like she was trying to back track and in a weird round about way, apologize somehow. I only sent one text back letting her know I was working and that this wasn't a conversation to be easily had while doing so. Plus, it was open house night at school for my step sons and I wanted to be there for it. I texted her back at some point in the evening letting her know that I just don't want to have a close relationship with her and that she can't respect boundaries. She asked if she could still see my son (her only biological grandkid) and I told her I wouldn't keep him from her. My mom then said fine and to let her know from now on every Sunday evening via text when are good days/times to see him. Yeah, of course she had to find a way to control that too. I didn't care though if it meant creating the necessary distance.

However, she keeps trying to push the envelope and I know she is trying to open a conversation with me again (right now I'm just being very dry and to the point and not talking unless necessary). She keeps trying to text and ask if my step sons want to hang out with her (which she never cared about until recently) or request to talk on the phone to my son more than she normally would...it's literally been 2 days since I told her I don't want a relationship.

I know this was already a lot without me even going down every avenue, so thank you if you made it this far. Again, I'm just looking for advice for how to go no contact because I feel like I'm close and I know it's going to be a long process but I really don't want to back track now and have to start over. But I can feel her trying to be submissive and feel things out. I know she is waiting for a good moment to have the next blow up and get me to break down. Her birthday is next week and then it's my son's birthday in 3 weeks. I know she will want to try and fix things in time for that and if I'm honest I'm not sure how to avoid letting her come to my son's birthday...but I'm also scared for how she'll act because she doesn't mind making a scene in front of others.

I'm incredibly anxious to pull the trigger on no contact. I keep walking around my house making sure all the windows and doors are locked and cameras are working because she has broken in to my house in the past to start a fight when I ignored her before. I shouldn't be scared of my own mom, but I am. I know last time I should have called the police and filed a restraining order. I wish I did, but it all just took me by surprise. If she ever does it again I will be more prepared mentally, but it still scares me a bit.

Really, what this displayed was an early indicator of his complete lack of distinction between where he ended &amp; I began, or regard for my own personal autonomy - to any degree.   


I wouldn't even want to re-use a tissue that had my own mucus on it. My little voiced concern was COMPETELY justified, but not to nDad.   


The idea of me speaking up &amp; saying that I didn't want his snot touching my face was silly &amp; could rightly just be disregarded because, well, I AM HIM. (in his mind)

I was a teenager, the boy I dated for 2 years and gave my virginity to cheated on me. For months and months afterward he gaslit me about it, until I actually apologized for being crazy. That year I got to stay an extra week with my Nana after a family vacation. I had so much self esteem pumped into me during that visit that I was finally able to break up with him.

Such hell was waiting for me when I got home.

That rat fucking bastard told my parents I was mean to him when I left him, and even told them that we had been fucking. They hid that they knew until I got back so they could ambush me. First it was lectures about how unacceptable it was to be mean to him. How they never ‘taught me to behave like that.’ Then we moved on into the lectures about how ashamed they were of me and how now they needed to ‘get me tested for stds and pregnancy’ (lol never fucking happened, they never cared about my body, just shaming me).

Over the next months my parents kept driving him to church with us, and having him over to the house without ever checking to see if I was okay with it. 

When I expressed to my dad how uncomfortable that made me, he decided to tell me how hard the breakup was ON HIM because it reminded him of his parents divorce. Very appropriate guilt to lay on the doorstep of your self-harming teenage daughter.

They remained close to him well after they kicked me out, only keeping their distance after it became apparent he was emotionally abusing the teenager he married in his 20s.

Let's call him James. James frequently argued with teachers, got into fights, both in school and during extracurricular activities, would throw sports equipment and storm out of the gym if he was on the losing side of a game in PE class. His longest streak of not getting sent to the principal's office for something was only 2 weeks, if I remember right. The dude could not manage his feelings whatsoever.

Well, if you saw the inner workings of the household James came from, it would not be difficult to figure out why. His parents were blatantly, overtly over-controlling of him 100% of the time. They didn't even give the shits necessary to put on a mask for guests. One of his younger sibling had broken a toy of his that he was never given a replacement for, on the grounds of some kind of group punishment. They refused to help him with homework. He wasn't allowed to show emotion of any kind. One time, I was over at his house, and we weren't allowed to go inside for anything other than to use the bathroom, because his parents determined that he had spent enough time playing inside already for the day. That's all I did get to see, can't imagine what else he was subjected to behind closed doors.

By the time middle school started, we split paths. I stayed in public, and James' parents enrolled him at a private school, because they sincerely believed that his bad behavior was the product of negative influences from other students, even though no one else in school had a record anywhere near as decorated, if you will, as his was. I never saw him in person again, but there were frequent rumors from other graduates of my elementary school about what trouble James got into in any given week, mostly more fights. There wasn't proof of any of it, and I'd kind of moved on, so I didn't think much of it. Then high school rolled around, and I caught news of James that I could not ignore.

Middle of my freshman year of high school, the word on the street was that James had been caught attempting murder. This wasn't just hearsay, there were local news headlines corroborating it. He had a kitchen knife in his possession at school, and was very close to using it on one of his peers, only being stopped by several other students tackling him. Apparently, the almost-victim's family dropped charges. Whether a correctional institution actually would have fixed this guy's temperament is anyone's guess. A quick glance through his Facebook profile told me that he now works as a middle school teacher, and either is in deep denial about, or doesn't remember how awful his rearing was (several posts saying how his parents are the greatest ever can be found).

I never thought I did, because my mom is verbally overbearing. She has called me her best friend, freaks out over potential illness (she's a ""healer"" by trade), is constantly looking for sympathy etc. but at many key junctions throughout my life, she physically wasn't there.

For example, (and probably the most impactful) when I was 12, I moved to live in a commune ""with my mom"" -- except she never came too. For two years, I thought I was living my best life as a self-sufficient 12 year old without oversight or punishment, but really...I was pretty alone. Did I want to do it at the time? Yeah! But...I was 12. Without parents. She never took responsibility until way later in my life, when she'd call me crying about how sad she is about everything, and I was confused about it until now.

I lived in a house by myself on 5 acres with multiple groups of people that all took care of the property, did weird shit like hosted drum circles, grew and sold pot, and ate communal-style. I walked to the bus to go to school, and my dad would drive two hours or so for school meetings every once in awhile. I could go whole days at a time without seeing an adult though, and was able to freely go and do what I wanted...which, for the most part, meant I wandered into the forest and hung out with animals.😂

I think this fear of abandonment has played into a lot of things in my life. 

I've become overly stable in adulthood just trying to find footing. I also constantly feel like a burden. I'm not sure of myself. I feel the need to ""buy"" people's love. I feel genuinely better alone. Doing crafts or creating things. Not with people.

My mom recently had an injury where she was hospitalized, fortunately the injury didnt leave her immobile etc,she just needs a bed rest for a few weeks until she can walk normally again. 
My dad is mostly helping her during recovery but of course I help too.
But still, if there was someone else who saw their parent get hospitalized after a very bloody injury they would be horrified,feel so sad,and act very compassionate towards them.
I don’t feel sadder than I would if I saw the same thing happen to one of my classmates/a person I saw an the street. It is probably because there is so little emotional bond between us.
I feel like I’m a very bad person because even though she traumatized me I believe she really loves me,she just grew up like this and doesnt actually know how to act better.

I recently graduated highschool and have applied to my local university - into biomedical sciences. 

I did this because I thought I wanted to be a doctor, but now I'm not so sure. I guess I romanticized the entire field of medicine, as well as strong encouragement from my family to study medicine. Ive taken a while to ponder about this, and to ponder about my future career paths, but to be honest. I'm lost. I have no passion for it. In fact, I have no passion for anything. I cant find my love for a career because I am laughably apathetic about everything.

I fear that I might make the wrong choice, that I'd give up my blood sweat and tears all into a career that I end up hating. I also fear that if I delay myself - take a year to ""work things out"" - that Id become a failure.

I was so excited and this was a dream I've been looking forward to for all my life. My family was happy for me as well. 

As we were driving around, I noticed a pizza place next to my apartment. I got excited because I love pizza and was (jokingly) talking about how I was going to eat there every day. 

What happened next was that my mom went ""youre going to look like a pig"" in a tone that felt a little mean to me. That was really triggering for me. I have been feeling very uncomfortable with my body lately because I've gained weight, and she loves to point it out. I was so happy in that moment, having moved in and ready to start my new life, and her words just ruined the mood. I was really hurt and I calmly said ""hey mom can you please not compare me to a pig"". She then got really defensive and said she didn't mean it, and that she didn't know it was bad to compare people to pigs (such a lie). I didn't want a confrontation so I just said ""okay fine you didn't mean it"" but I was fighting back tears because I was hurt. 

She then got really mad at me and she hasn't talked to me in a week. Her demeanor immediately became icy and cold. She is essentially waiting for me to reach out and apologize, but I have nothing to apologize for. Generally, I don't really reach out to her, due to our countless fights and the harm she has caused to me in the past. I feel like I can't talk about anything without starting a fight. So I've pretty much backed off and she is the one that usually reaches out to me. The fact that she hasn't said anything shows me that she is giving me the silent treatment, but I know that if I mention it to her, she'll flip it around and tell me that I'm giving her the silent treatment instead.

Tl;dr: I apologize way too much and everyone around me is telling me to stop. After reading a bunch of articles online I realize how negatively it effects others and how it is manipulative and self-involved, and a way to manage anxiety. How can I stop constantly over-apologizing? 

I feel horrible for putting others in the position of reassuring me. I’ve read every article I can find online about the phenomenon and I’ve tried all sort of tricks, like replacing sorry with “thank you,” but nothing seems to be working — I keep automatically saying sorry before I even realize I’ve said it.


When I think about apologizing less it fills me with terror, like letting go of a security blanket. I don’t know how else to manage all the stupid excess fear and anxiety and guilt. I constantly feel like I’m “in trouble” or might be.

Just saying thank you and not apologizing (which I know I should do) is so painful and hard for me. Talk about first world problems!

He controls every task she does and all his of needs are met first, only his opinion matters, and if you don’t agree, prepare yourself. Once when I was on video chat with my friend and my dad was verbally abusing me, without realizing she was listening and watching, he gave me a bloody nose and busted lip. She called the police and when they showed up to my house both of my parents were distraught that I called them. The police looked at my house, looked at all the materialistic items we had and told me to be grateful I had a family like the one the saw in those ten minutes. And they left. 

I had no phone, internet or television for 3 months. I only had myself and a journal. I was so disassociated for those months. My mother never came to check on me. I was only allowed to stay in my room and go out to eat when everyone else was done. This all happened when I was 15-16.

Now at 25, finishing school soon, I have never felt more desperate to leave and never look back. I’m trying to take advantage as much as I can that I can stay here for free and just do my best in school but part of me just wants to drop out and move far away and never speak to them again. I walk around this house with my heart in my throat and biting my tongue until it bleeds. I’m embarrassed when my dad has his outbursts towards me in front of my partner. 

He is a toxic patriarch and no one can stop him and no one can help me except for myself.

When I was a kid I wasn’t treated like a kid. I was treated like a college student; always being told to study constantly which would make me unhappy because my cousins and friends would be playing and I’d be here studying for no reason. I was in grade 5. That shit doesn’t even matter. 

I was always compared to my cousins and other people’s kids. Instead of being proud of me when I got really good grades on tests and exams they would briefly appraise it but then suddenly compare me to another kid they know and tell me that he got better marks than you. This would make me feel like shit and worthless.

Everything was my fault. Helping dad fix something and can’t do something right because I don’t know to use a tool? My fault. Lost something valuable to them? My fault. Can’t do something perfectly while I’m learning? My fault. 

On top of all that, I was the punching bag, the scapegoat of my friend group. Because of this I started to develop anxiety and major depression. I would avoid social gatherings because I was afraid of being judged and bullied. I would sleep for hours, be unmotivated, wouldn’t help anyone because I was always tired. 

When I got to college I developed OCD and it would highly impact my life and daily tasks. When I confronted my parents about this in 2018 they said I was lying, that I was making excuses, that it’s all in my head. I’ve been put on antidepressants and antipsychotics ever since.

They keep urging me to stop taking my meds because “it’s bad for me” when they are the only thing that keeps me sane. If I miss a dose or stop taking them it makes me very depressed again

My first suicide attempt was in December of 2020 because of the immense pressure my parents were putting on me to finish school. Since then, they have guilt tripped me and still refuse to believe my mental health disorders. They keep making excuses that it’s all in my head, that only I have control over it; and them being extremely religious (which is the main cause of my OCD) always tell me to believe in god and all of this will go away; blah blah blah. Since December, I have attempted 4 more times and have been admitted to psych wards. 

Don’t get me wrong; they said they care about me and to never attempt again and to be open with them. So when I told them everything that they were the cause of my mental disorders, they of course, told me that they were saints while raising me as a kid while refusing to acknowledge the toxic traits and behaviours they acted out against me. 

Anyways I have nobody to blame except my parents and toxic friends I have had to deal with for all of my mental disorders.

Basically, Im not too much older than my younger bro and since we were little Ive tried to involve him in things I would do. When we moved to a different country and he came into my school in later years I would take him with me to school everyday and try to talk with him when he was in his awkward antisocial phase (unlike my older brother that essentially used to ignore me in boarding school cuz I guess he didnt want to be associated with his lil bro), because I know how it felt.

When I left to go to uni in London I would take him with me to concerts and he’d stay at mine. However, now that he is at uni and has a good friendship group he’s started looking down on me and I think this is also because of my place in the family. We haven’t argued or anything like that, I dont have the strength to do so with any of my family members anymore especially after a lifelong cucle of abuse. But, he goes out of his way to disrespect me even when it is not neccessary. I fell out with my friendship group before graduation, so Ive spent this summer by myself for the most part and he doesnt even attempt to gist me about where he goes etc. Another example is he recently started a new account on Facebook and followed everyone in my family except from me and then when I was talking about fb around him he immediately changed his behaviour.

This reslly feels like a last straw because my other siblings and my mum are really toxic. And Ive honestly given up on human relationships to be honest.

I felt a lot of shame for who I was at just 5 year old. 
But even with my limited vocabulary at that age, I would tell my abusers that they were being mean to me. It was a word I learned in school about bullies (the irony). 

I would openly confront their behavior as mean. Because I was taught in school that you stand up to bullies and tell them what they’re doing is mean and hurtful. That it’s supposed to take their power away if you bravely confront them with the truth. 

Imagine a 5 year old me, fearlessly calling out her abusers with all that conviction, bravery and anger! I wish I had that courage now lol. 
Sometimes I imagine the girl I would’ve been if they didn’t take the time to break my spirit. Once upon a time, I was brave. And I learned how to be brave.

As usual, they turned it against me. Anytime I confronted them, they would mock or punish me for it. “Always the same word- mean! Maybe you’re the mean one for saying it. Why do you say it like that? If you say mean one more time! Here we go again, calling us mean. That’s the only word she knows.” (Even as a write this I feel that old guilt for likening my parents with school bullies. How dare I? So ungrateful. But they were much worse than any bully) 
It was easier to believe because all three of them would laugh and gang up on me. Gone was the brave little 5 year old. 

But I like to think of her fondly. She knew she was outnumbered and it didn’t scare her to try anyways. 

I can still remember her anger and the way she prepared to confront them. Big scowl on her face, hands on her hip, chest puffed out for good measure, standing in the middle of the kitchen, all of some 3 and 1/2 feet tall, choosing to forget the fear she felt, and loudly saying, “Hey! You’re being mean.” She knew how to set boundaries and she knew the standard of treatment she deserved. 

She’s my hero.

Personally my mother lost her first her husband (my father) and developed a drinking problem and very few boundaries especially with me growing up and would vent to me about her new husband and even share intimate details and issues, she was also very controlling and over protective of me. Usually this would happen when she would binge drink by herself on the weekends in the living room and wanted company. She would also be very volatile and would be constantly angry cleaning and raging. Would verbally berate me and call me things like useless idiot etc when I would make mistakes or do something that made her mad. She sometimes hit me with whatever she had close by like a broom stick or would pull my hair and I would hear my scalp pop.

It seems she would be nicer to me when she was mad at her husband and meaner to me when she was good with him. Sometimes it was a weird dynamic where she would defend me a lot from the step dad and wouldn't let him try to ""discipline"" me. Mind you I never disrespected him even though he always had a disrespectful vibe towards me and jealousy from the enmeshment. I was also asked to help parent my siblings to compensate for what she felt were her husband's short comings in that aspect.

I've moved out after step dad disrespected me and my gf after he was caught on a dating app talking to women in other countries. I'm confused because Mom has her good moments and seems to have empathy towards me and others and apologized for her past behaviors when I told her how I feel about it. However she can be very irrational and has a hard time even understanding the concept of boundaries without getting offended if I set one. My younger half siblings also have a hard time understanding boundaries. Whenever I have to set a boundary to a toxic behavior from any of them they all get offended and start to attack me as one.

1. If you're in the hospital, I'm not going to visit you unless you're having a heart attack. A panic attack isn't worth a hospital trip. Grow up.

No. your sleep schedule is why you have panic attacks and depression, if you just listened to me you wouldn't have these problems.

Hi all,

I posted this in r/justnofamily as well but thought I would cross-post here since it seems relevant. Sorry in advance for the long post but I am looking for advice from any of you who have broken away from abusive family situations at an older age.

I am a 25-year-old still living in my abusive parents' home. The abuse is not physical nor has it ever been, but it is tumultuous and is very ingrained in me as I have lived in this situation for virtually my entire life. I have a decent enough job, a bachelor's degree in accounting, and am moving on to obtain my master's degree this next year.

My mother is an opioid addict and a narcissist and my father is an enabler and has been a participant in the verbal and emotional abuse just as much as my mother. They have stolen thousands and thousands of dollars from me, on top of the rent that they charged me every month. Before I was really privy to what they were doing, I had a joint checking account with them which enabled them to take as much money from me as they wished. I was able to get my own bank account and transfer the funds I had left, which caused a horrific situation for me at home. In the past when I have challenged my mother on anything, she has threatened me. She has told me she would call the cops and have me removed from the household, that my things would be on the front lawn when I got home from work, or that the locks would be changed and I would be unable to get back in the home and if I attempted to get in I would be legally charged with breaking and entering. She has gotten herself into a fair bit of trouble with her opioid addiction and has dragged me and my siblings into it more times than I can count. We found her unresponsive on the toilet one night, called 911, and after she came to and the paramedics told her they strongly recommend going into the hospital, she made my ten-year-old sister sleep in her bed to make sure she kept breathing through the night.

She is a pathological liar, a horrifically gifted manipulator, and is all about keeping up appearances. Her spending plunged her and my dad into bankruptcy several times. When I was 20 years old, the first time my sister and I reached out to our extended family for help, we found out that my parents had also stolen upwards of 20,000 from our family's trust, which provided $500 to us each birthday and Christmas. every single check went into funding my mother's drug and shopping addiction. My parents have belittled me and told me I was worthless my entire life. They called me greedy and useless when I would ask about the money they stole and would tell me I was a loser for still living in my parents' home at such an old age. Long story short, they have done some terrible things and the abuse has always remained hidden. I was a high-achieving student as was my sister, and no one suspected a thing because we never told anyone anything; from the outside, we looked like a pretty perfect family. The scary thing is I thought we were too until the abuse became more apparent and my mom's drug addiction became glaringly obvious. When I tried to reach out to some people who knew the family, they told my mom and my mom told them I was clinically insane and was seeking treatment. The gaslighting and roller coaster of emotion has honestly made me feel like I was insane. One day the world is falling apart and the next, everything is fine. If I ever so much as brought up a traumatic event, both my mother and father would say, ""what do you mean?"" or, ""you're crazy, get some help."" Despite my mother's constant immoral behavior, she has never seen real consequences because she can talk herself out of virtually anything, and everyone believes her sick, twisted stories. I even catch myself believing them sometimes and even feeling bad for her.

After reaching out for help years ago, my younger sister was able to find other, less abusive accommodations, as was I. However, shortly after I had moved out, I went straight back. I have been there ever since, stewing in a silent kind of misery. I have developed many mental issues and unhealthy coping mechanisms to survive. Every day is a massive struggle for me, I harbor extreme amounts of self-hatred, and I am afraid to leave my parents' house because I am nearly certain I will crash and burn. On a logical level, I understand that these feelings are a symptom of abuse. Knowing this does not change the paralyzing fear I feel to step outside of the abusive situation. Honestly, I feel very hopeless, trapped, and drained to even tackle adulthood as it is now; thinking about escaping this situation and healing from it seems like an insurmountable challenge. I do not want to live this way anymore, but I don't even know where to start.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713976,public,self,Getting out of an abusive household,0,[],0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p8vur5/getting_out_of_an_abusive_household/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did my best.

Ever since i was a boy i was surrodend by drugs and alchool where we lived.

Dad used booze to cope with his miserable childhood albeit he has a good heart he was irreponsible and bad with money.

When i was 6 years old i witnessed and stopped your first suicide attempt.

My life as a kid was bad.

Surronded by gangs i tried my best.
I didnt join them.

I got beat up because of it, i was beaten almost every single day anyways so more pain did very little for me.

Someone saw me get beaten by a mob and told you i was in a gang and that was an iniciation.

Thats a lie, the only male rolemodel i had my dear grandpa who was sick his whole life but did his best...

I couldnt do this to him joining a gang.

When i was out of highschool i started working and living life trying my best.

Dad was in debt grandpa payed all.

Soon grandpa died.
Before he died i promised him to take care of the family.

We almost lost the house he left us dad tried hard and i did my best.

We saved it.

I was working in a slave labour job with barely any money i didnt quit i did my best.

Dads health suffered because of an accident and i needed the work no matter how bad it was...

I worked if needed 30 h almost without pay.

Then my mentally challenged uncle whos his hard of earing almost went blind.

I quit my job to take care of him...

Then dad had a spinal infection leaving him paralyzed...

I yelled in the middle of the night WHY HAS GOD FORSAKEN ME?

No reply. Only tears.

I went to church i did my best.

Everyday i cooked. I made sure dad had his treatment so did uncle.

I went everymonth for his shot bought his meds went to the hospital with him.

Docs said dad would die. I broke down my church pastor gave me the only confort i ever received.

I did my best.

Along the day dad was receving money from unemployement and you refused to pay for his treatment.

So i used his money for that.
Never took a penny for me even tho you did.

One day i cant draw money from the ATM from your bank account mom and uncles.

You accused me of stealing your pension...
I left the house.

Nothing on me but my wallet my bible 5 bucks and the keys to a home i didnt know id be able to comeback to.

I returned home for something that i think was one of my books.
I managed to convince you to go to the bank with me by taking a ride from my friend from church.

Dad has a credit card.
The debts were old.

I never stole anything you didnt care tho.

After we leave the bank family friend who we trusted deleted passwords for entire family for Social Security and Finances...

I recovered them.

Dad transfered to a rehab facility he recovered thanks to a miracle from god and alot of good will...

You keep saying horrible things...

When i told you i was sexually assaulted you didnt care...

Still i kept going.

When a doctor risked her job to assure my uncle had his surgery i did my best.

I had to quit the queue and had no papers to prove it if i left.
I trusted the doctor and in gods will.

She operated regardless of no papers at the time before the surgery...

Uncle could finally see a tiny bit from one eye.
I was happy.

The same doctor you badmouthed complaining about the price of the medicine my uncle takes while you have plenty to purchase it...

You no longer have debts.
I took care of it.

Dad is walking and alive.
I managed to get him a retirement pension and a supplement for his disability.

And now im disposable... I do not know where things will go now.

I will likely have no place to comeback to.
But i kept my promise old man i took care of them.

Im tired.
All i wanted was love and a peaceful life.

I never wanted your money nor anything you think i did.
Just peace love and to be normal.

Im so tired.
Why couldnt you love me?
Why?

What did i do?
At the age of 11 or 12 was my first attempt at ending my life.

I was saved by an old man.
I wish i could remember his face.

Life is filled with pain.
I have tried.

Loving you.
Caring for you.
Solving your problems.

It is never enough.
You always bad mouth everyone and accused me of things i never did.

Soon im going away almost no money to a new place without anything planned.

Im leaving this here because i will be without internet for a while when i move.

I said i didnt care what happened after i kept my promise to my dead grandpa.

I meant it but i had hope our hearts could reach one another...
It didnt happen.

Im so tired.

I never cared for money drugs booze going out late.
I just wanted some peace.

Either way this will end now.
The fire is fading the tears are flowing.

I cant anymore.
I will try to make a life far away but im so tired.

When i tried to reach for mental help.

The doctor laughed in my face.
I left never to comeback.

Im so tired.

If you are a parent reading this please dont let the sins of your life be the burden of your child.

Life as it is now for me im not sure im just not.

Im hoping i get to read this again later in my life if i make it and if i get the means to.

I just want to rest and be free.

Ill be online for a while longer not sure when i will go. Maybe 2 to 3 days? Maybe tomorrow who knows?

At this point if you are reading this take the advice of this broken man.

Do not expect love or try to get it from people whos heart you have never seen.

Do whats best for you and solidify your life.
Goodbye friends even tho i never posted here i have read alot of posts.

Hopefully a happy ending will follow.
If it doesnt.

I am 24 and have become a shell of who I was, constantly seeking moms approval, health failing, self sabotaging. I experience intense fear, pain, ocd, rumination, panic attacks, cptsd, fibromyalgia, etc.

I am formulating an escape plan where I can move to another state and work full time and cut off all contact. Very hard to do as they are sensing the disconnect already and calling my every day. After years of fear mongering and not letting me have my own car (convincing me that I don’t need one, too expensive, etc) they are finally not getting me one, but getting themselves a new one and letting me have the car that they held over my head for many years. 

We would have fights where I was terrified and tried to escape but they would grab the keys and not let me go - saying this isn’t even your car. I was and still am like a tiny child in a 24 year olds body.

I hope my escape plan works and that I can live a healthy, happy, narc free life really soon.

I also made the mistake of freaking out three weeks ago and telling my mom about her being a narcissist so now she’s read up on it and giving me the silent treatment. She’s sending in her flying monkeys - my dad and my grandma to call me (I recently moved out but they’re helping cover expenses) and to tell me that everything’s okay and that I’m getting the car and mom is upset at you for telling her she’s a narcissist.

Lol, on one hand these people are dangerous, soul-crushing creatures that inflict severe fear and pain, but on the other hand they are extremely predictable once you learn all of their manipulation tactics.

It’ll be hard to finally disattach from them forever, but it must be done. I’m scared but also ready to move on.

The narrative in their heads is that they were the best parents ever and did everything they could for me.

I lived away at college for 5 years, and realised I couldn't move home so I purposely chose this city for my 12 month post-grad residency because it's 200 miles from home and I thought I was finally going to be free. 

Well I thought wrong. After all the effort I went through to convince my parents this was my only option, and find a place my Ndad agreed with, he packed his shit and moved with me (he's sleeping in my living room). It's been two weeks and I'm literally suicidal. He knew I didn't want to live with him, and we had so many conversations about it and every time he'd accuse me of hiding something. 

Last weekend he noticed I didn't want him there (I was staying in my room, not talking to him much). I got home that night after a full shift, deep cleaned my room, and at midnight he asked me to make him food so I did and then he got mad at me and screamed at me for over an hour (I didn't even get to finish my food). He called me all kinds of names, said I've become corrupted because I've moved out and he should've never let me, that he'll no longer allow his unmarried daughters to move out. That he left the rest of our family behind and ruined his life for me and I'm an ungrateful and unappreciative bitch and he should've let me eat shit sharing a bunk bed with my little bro. That he's gonna check my emails/ phone and find out why I wanted to move so far. He was threatening to beat me and warning me not to piss him off or he would do unspeakable things and to behave myself or he'll go crazy because if he loses me he loses everything, all his hopes and dreams and will become suicidal and have no mercy on me. Then he started laughing and smiling and hugging me and telling me he loves me ? 

That night I planned my suicide. The next day I had to go into work and he told me to wear my glasses so my coworkers won't notice because my eyes were so swollen. I stole a bunch of drugs and planned to OD on them when I was ready. The next day he apologised for yelling at me, and promised he won't if I promise not to make him angry. He took me out shopping but obviously I wasn't in the mood so I was quiet then he started yelling at me for holding a grudge? Like ... I literally want to die rn bc and you want me to smile and act happy? 

Anyway then I had a mental breakdown and told him I wanted to KMS and I hate life and I don't want to live anymore. That I moved away to get space and I can't live like this I want to be alone. So he agreed to leave me alone. He was meant to leave last week but he said he'd stay because I was getting my vaccine in case I get sick. Well I got sick and vomited at work but he was asleep, my boss took me home. Now he's talking like he's going to stay ""let's make this a happy successful year for both of us, let's eat healthy"", and I feel so uncomfortable I want to crawl out of my skin. 

He bought me some self-help books for depression, he makes me breakfast and dinner, he drops me off and picks me up from work, he cleans and washes dishes (""because one day you'll buy me a Ferrari""). He never lifted a finger at home my mother did everything for him and on top of that he treated her like actual shit. He thinks he's being a good father and I feel ungrateful but at the same time I don't want this, I didn't ask for this. I just want to be alone and have my own space. I told him my friends want to visit, in hopes that he'll leave but he just offered to pay for their hotel. Like bro just take the hint and LEAVE damnnn.

I told my Emum and she was like ""oh your poor dad is stressed and lonely"" ?? I have 5 younger siblings, some of them are in elementary/ high school and yet he's here with me... wHY? why's he so obsessed with me surely they need him more? I'm scared to bring it up again in case he goes psycho on me like I really don't have the mental capacity for this right now I'm working and studying full time I can't.

So I’ve been out as MTF trans for basically 10 months give or take, and I have been trying to convince my conservative parents to respect who I am, and to leave me alone when necessary (because they keep on invading my privacy, such as looking through personal diaries, asking my friends what I said about them on hangouts, the list goes on)

To try gain independence, I ordered about €20 (or about $24) worth of clothes and accessories on shein, which was a big step. Usually they would tell me or even force me into buying clothes I never connected with. The clothes were nothing alarming, a skirt, pair of tights and 2 chokers, and thats it. I thought that because my sister was allowed to dress that way, I could dress the same (because I was always an advocate for unisex clothing).

About 2 weeks later I receive a notification from my country’s leading postal agency informing me that the package arrived at my house, but I was away and asked my dad if he could take the package in. I did ask him not to open it because it was private, but in typical narc parent fashion, he did anyway

Me and him had to have a discussion a few days later, and he said that he burned the clothes in a remote field to stop me from ever getting them back

Ever since i am stuck in a stalemate, because if I ever try to order more, he would most likely destroy them, but the ever present dysphoria is a lot to overcome without doing much feminine shit.

I had the misfortune of being raised by two awful, abusive, selfish people and reading all of your posts makes me feel less alone. I put a trigger warning on this because I'm sure reading this might bring up some feelings for some of you who have experienced something similar.

My nmadre deserves a post of her own, but this post is about my nfather  Fucking Jim. 

My nfather is an older parent. He's 72 and I'm 29. He has 2 older daughters from a previous relationship that have gone NC on him. They're in their 40's and 50's. I'm the youngest of his 4 children that ""he is aware of"". I don't blame my sisters for going NC on the guy. He tells me all these stories of driving around the NW in a Frito Lay van he had converted into a hippie mobile in his 20's. His daughters are notably absent from all these stories, but he does mention plenty of girlfriends with young kids that were along for the ride!

My dad is a bit of a hoarder and he has RV's and sheds all over our 10 acre property full of antiques and junk that's probably been shat all over by rats and is likely covered in mold. This stuff is the most important thing in the world to him. He was never one to hold a steady job, and usually made money doing odd mechanic jobs out of a shop he built on our land. As a result we were poor and there was always junky stuff all over our property. The houses we lived in were always unfinished and most of my life I lived in houses with exposed frames with sheets separating our bedrooms to give us a little privacy.

My nmadre was physically and verbally abusive and mentally unstable and my father just let her do her thing to me. He also had a horrible temper and wasn't afraid of slapping me to the ground or chasing me around the house with a leather belt, so he wasn't much better. He was also a creepy pervert who was always making lewd comments about teenage girls we went to school with to my older brother (who's obviously gay, but my nfather is in denial about it). So I never felt comfortable having girlfriends over because my house and property was a wreck, my mother was an abusive, mentally unstable latina who never cared to learn English after 20 plus years in the US, and my father was a disgusting creepy pervert.

My dad is now retired and living off social security. The only person my dad treats very well is my favorite Uncle and only decent relative. My Uncle is fairly well off and is always buying my dad everything he needs and giving him money. My dad is only kind to his dog and people he knows he can get something out of. Uncle lives in California and we are in Texas. 

In 2020 I was laid off from my job which paid really well. I was totally freaking out because I'm the breadwinner of my family unit and there was no way I would be able to pay mortgage and bills without a job. I totally downsized my life and my father convinced me to buy this house out in the country that we used to live in before my nmadre won it from my nfather in divorce court, took off to live in Mexico, and left it abandoned for 12 years. The house sits on an acre and all the land around it is owned by my nfather. My nfather built a very small one bedroom cabin about 300 yards away from the old house. 

 I was hesitant to purchase a house that was owned by a parent I had NC with ( I have had NC with my egg donor for over 12 years)  that's a stone's throw away from my nfather, but I was desperate and the place had well water and I could afford to buy it outright with my savings! The house is huge too and about half of the house is in pretty decent shape. This would allow me to live somewhere with no rent and water bill so I could afford to go back to school to get a new job.

 My nfather was so excited! He promised he would help us with repairs  (remember, the place had been vacant out in the country for 12 years). He even promised he would gift me the acre between my house and the road so I wouldn't be landlocked by his property. So I reached out to a family member that was still contact with my nmadre to be the mediator for our transaction and pulled the trigger. 

It's been a year now and all is not well. My nfather hasn't done much to help us with the house, and what he has done I've had to pay him for. On top of that, he's verbally accosted and guilt tripped me into handing over about $1500 worth of my money. (I mentioned I'm unemployed, right?) 

He immediately forgot his promise to sign over the acre between our house and the road so now we are landlocked by his property and are forced to use his driveway which he says we are ""destroying"". I drive a fucking subaru crosstrek, it's not damaging shit.  if anything his awful driveway is damaging my car. He has allowed the land surrounding the one acre I own to grow up head high all around us and doesn't give us the option to tend to it. I have a 10 year old boy and two small dogs so I live in fear of snakes and coyotes attacking them from the tall grass and brush. He doesn't care. 

A few months ago he decided to pick a huge fight with me because I decided to give away a minifridge of mine that my dad stowed away into one of his many storage sheds on the property after deciding it belonged to him. I didn't ask his permission to give it away (because it was mine) and he yelled and screamed and threw stuff at me. I was crying and hyperventilating when I walked out of his cabin to my porch where my boyfriend's dad was waiting to take the minifridge to his son. His dad saw I was visibly upset and felt guilty and uncomfortable. I said, between sobs, that it was best if he didn't take the fridge. My nfather was walking over at this point and he claims he overheard me saying to my FIL that they couldn't take the fridge because of my nfather. Of course, this embarrassed my nfather because I guess I made him look bad, and that was basically enough for him to decide that he hates me and never wants to talk to me again. This has really done a number to my mental health because now I KNOW that worthless junk is more important to my nfather than I am.

Now I live 300 yards away from my nfather in a house that's completely surrounded by land he owns that's overgrown and covered in junk that he cares about more than he cares about me. He ignores me every time he sees me, which is everyday. He only texts me to demand things from me or complain about how my boyfriend, child and I are doing something wrong. I live with crippling depression and anxiety due to the verbal and physical abuse inflicted upon me my entire life by my narcissistic parents and now I'm stuck living next to one who's goal is to make us as miserable as he is. I have been dealing with suicidal ideation since I was a teenager, and it's particularly bad right now. I've been reading lots of books about toxic parents and reading a lot of posts on this group, which really help me feel less alone.

If you've read this far, thank you. I honestly don't even mind if I'm talking into a void because it just feel good to put this out into the world. I guess I just feel awfully depressed and unloved. I keep struggling with this sense of hopelessness and guilt for bringing my boyfriend and his perfectly nice, normal family into my web of family drama bullshit. I'm scared they will see that I am damaged and unlovable and convince him to find someone with a better family. Holy shit.

You were trying to guilt trip me into thinking that my reaction and attitude towards you those days is my fault.
Well guess what, it isn't.
I'm so over that time when I was confused to why you behave like you do, and whether that's my fault.
I now see clearly that I ofc have the right to behave like that, that's the least I can do if not go NC.
Which you absolutely deserve.
You are always guilt tripping me because you ""did so much for me"" and that ""your only responsibility is to feed me, and that you did more than feeding me, so apparently you did so much ""
Yeah sure you did everything for me, you keep bringing up every time you took us on a vacation even though my mom and I requested that we should go to another place instead of the same location we go to every summer, and you started yelling and telling us that we aren't going anywhere else , because this is your favorite place.
To seem like a good father, you always compare yourself to the worst of the worst: that abusive neighbor you knew as a kid who didn't feed her kids nothing but ramen, who didn't wake her kids up in the morning to go to school, and didn't buy them more than 1 pair of shoes a year.
You only compare yourself to her to seem way better. You never compared yourself to my friend's parents, those parents that although they did way more things to their kids, they never ever made them feel guilty or like they were a burden to them.
They did all of that with love and expected nothing in return. They never were emotionally and physically abusive, and then call them ""selfish/ungrateful"" later in life for why they are distancing themselves from them, or for not letting them micromanage their every move. 
I used to fall victim to your manipulation and guilt tripping. But not anymore.
Yes, I still cry thinking about my past and how you were even more abusive when I was a kid. It still hurts to think about that, I grieve the genuine loving parent I never had, but that doesn't mean I'll fall for your manipulation anymore.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713959,public,self,Words I wish I could tell my dad to his face,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p8sln7/words_i_wish_i_could_tell_my_dad_to_his_face/,some_ads,7,supporturgent,b4c5598c-82c9-11e3-9642-12313d27e9a3,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

We were given the typical ""you have a great life,"" speeches and one of the points always was that ""we had the bigger room in the house,"" not the primary bedroom, but a room larger than the other two available. We never made that decision, it was made when we were like 10, we were originally in one of the smaller bedrooms and the grandmother was in the bigger one.

Eventually, we escape to the military and end up in Iraq, far from the N.

More time passes and we marry our high school sweetheart and end up back in Iraq. At this time the N is contacting my wife, telling her she should be ashamed that she was living in an apartment with the air conditioner running (in Texas in the summer) because I was deployed overseas.

This is now over a decade in the past, but as we have been talking about childhood, our wife brought up an interesting point where she kept mentioning a fan that would always run, but did nothing in the room. We didn't remember so asked for clarification, where she said that it was so hot in the room and the fan didn't help. No memory of it being hot, so asked how hot it was, she said it was the same as the ambient temperature, the same as walking into the garage.

And then it clicked, the reason the grandmother was moved out of the room was that either the AC was disconnected there or it simply couldn't reach the room. So we grew up with no heat / air for at least 7 years and became so numb to it that it didn't register. 

But the icing for the N side is the phone call to my wife saying she had the air conditioner running, when we literally found (some) better living conditions in a tent in the Middle East.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713960,public,nsfw,It is the little things that you never notice,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p8skx3/it_is_the_little_things_that_you_never_notice/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,trigger,60778980-0c49-11e5-81c7-0eb3ca6e6867,[Trigger Warning],,,,,,,,,,

I wished things were different, being treated as a scapegoat and black sheep because of Narcs also heavily impacted my life. Like yesterday I had my second drivers licence lesson.

I also heard that maybe I should become a parent, but I had to raise myself, all the thing I know is because I watched tv read books and take notes from other parents who had successful children, so that’s not a good idea.

I was not doing well mentally and had been struggling a lot with my parents for the last years of high school. My parents were always fighting with my school and at some point even tried suing them. (My parents lost). My grades in the middle of this emotional battlefield were not good enough and I had to redo my year. 

Luckily there is this instance where you can repeat only the subjects you failed, instead of redoing everything. I went there to then get my high school diploma. It was a city away, so I had to take the train. It was about 8 euros to go back and forth. In total it must have costed 1600 euro to even go to school. My parents told me I had to pay it. I had a part time job and as of their reasoning; ""YOU are the one who made a mess out of everything. So YOU can deal with the consequences"".  1600 euro is a lot as an 18 year old. But I managed, only to hear them say ""You wouldn't have made it without us"" 

Now my younger sister is going trough the same thing. The difference is that she is dropping out 2 years before the end of high school. So she will have to go by train for 2 or maybe even 3 years. I reached out to my sister to check up on her. (I am in NC with my parents, but she is still living at home). Maybe I could help her out financially, or try to help her find ways to cut some costs, like season tickets or other things I had never known about during my time. 

Turns out that she is getting everything paid for. Don't get me wrong; I'm happy for her as it decreases her stress a lot. And I did expect this a little because my sisters have always been treated differently to me. But it did stung. My parents reasoning was that my sisters autism was the cause of her dropping out of high school. The school didn't provide enough help for her. The school never understood my sister like my parents have. So now she is getting everything paid for. 

On the one hand it's making my NC feel more valid. On the other hand it stings so much that I have actively been discriminated at. My parents have always told me I'm less than my sisters because I'm not autistic and they are. (I've never been tested. I am looking into it more now though, since my GP already noticed some traits and advised me to check for it). My Ndad is autistic and my Nmom certainly has traits of it too, but never got diagnosed. They have told me things as ""You will never be as smart as they are"", ""If you passed this course, then it's extremely easy for your sister"" ""If you were autistic, maybe then you would have been less emotional and not compare yourself with your sisters so much""

Are they doing this to 'save' their imagine of autism? Or maybe to show others that they DO care for their children? Maybe they don't want my sister starting a tantrum and this is just the easy solution?

But here’s what happened last night and I’m sure more will happen today.

So I invited my mom and brother on a little day trip just 2 hours away to see a movie in 4D, you know, where the seats move and stuff. They wanted to go and mom asked me to buy the tickets and said she would reimburse me. I work part time and make very little money right now since that’s just my gig during grad school. Whatever, I’m getting reimbursed so I paid for the tickets and everything was fine.

Well, everything was fine until mom asked if we would be riding together. I live about 40 minutes from nmom. I told her I thought we would just meet there thinking that it wouldn’t be that big of a deal. Well, it was. I conceded because whatever, we could take my husband’s car and that’s the least of my concern, but I kept telling my mom that my husband and I wanted to go to a particular place for dinner afterwards that we’ve been wanting to go to for years. That was when all the fit pitching got extreme.

Nmom doesn’t like where we wanted to eat so she started flipping out and threatening me with rejection if I ever invite her to anything else ever again. Note that every time I usually invite her to a movie I’m willing to drive 40 minutes out just so she doesn’t have to drive 30 minutes to the theater near me, so her reaction was basically her way of saying I don’t do anything for her when I bend over backwards to keep the peace. 

She ended up dragging my dad into things saying only that I refused to ride together. At this point, I had surrendered on that one and it wasn’t an issue. I had to text my dad because she made it sound like he wasn’t taking my side in things (which, when the context is skewed I don’t blame him) so I had to explain the rest of things to him because I don’t want to be seen as the unreasonable one when I literally keep giving in so that my brother doesn’t have to suffer by not going.

I ended up telling my mom that I was surrendering because I didn’t want to have to deal with her being ridiculous over something stupid and small and then she gaslit me and said she didn’t want to ride with me if I’m going to be sulking the entire way.

So long story short, I paid a lot of money for a fun outing, mom tried to back out and threaten to not come to anything with me anymore because of a freaking restaurant, and I’m now dreading this day that was supposed to be fun and I genuinely hope my mom backs out.

He said that I'm an ungrateful child, and that he feels like I'm going to cut contact with him once I go to uni and move from the house. He then said that he doesn't need me at all in the future. He just wants me to be independent and he has no problem cutting contact with me forever.

I cried for so long last year thinking about all of that, the fact that I can't open up to him anymore, cause as soon as I do he hurts me deeply. I no longer was able to trust him, I was so done with this emotional roller-coaster.

I don’t know where else to go. My heart is racing as I post this. I am 17 years old, a girl, living in the US and i think my life is in danger.

Here is the full story. Yesterday on my way to school my mom was hurling insults at me continuously as per usual as I stared straight ahead. When I walked into classI felt wobby and teary and about ten minutes in I couldn’t hold it anymore and had to walk out and bawl in the bathroom. My teacher came in to check on me and suggested to see a counselor. I went to the counselour and vented about everything basically, the abuse and the restriction and manipulation I had all these years at the hands of my parents. There wasnt much she coyld do but she told me to stay strong and look forward to college. 

Then, in last period, i get a text from my dad. He says “Who is [boyfriend’s name], i read that letter in your diary.” My heart completely drops out my chest because i realize what this means. It means my parents have read my diary which is my explicit thoughts that run around in my head that i can never voice: about sex, the future, trauma from my parents, my wishes and dreams and experiences considered haram, how i intensely detest islam, and much more. They had tuned my room completely upside down. I hide my diary in such a discreet place so they must have been ravidly searching for it.i went to counsour again completely shaking and the social worker came and i think she talked to them over the phone which probably had to opposite of the intended effect and made them more mad and they were assaulting me about how i ruined their name in society and its my fault that bad things happen tht i am a whore and will burn in hell and my mom said she will lock me in the. Basement
 
My mom is constantly coming to me and threatening  me. The thing they most keep harassing my about is my boyfriend, the one good thing in my life. “Who is he, tell who he is, etc.” i haven’t said anything i am too scared to. This is genuinely the worst-case scenario. They are saying they will take my phone away and give me a brick one, with just their contacts. They are saying they will send and marry me off in India. They will pull me out of school ( i am most scared of this as it is my contact with people that can actually help me). I am genuinely afraid of being honor killed.

Then she gets the idea she can't pull me down the street after a few times. 

I've taken her out many times, shes had positive interactions with even cats. (theres a local 'Ma and Pa' pet store near me that has some cats free roam the whole store) 

I remember once I was talking to my cousin and she asked my mom why she never brings Willow on play dates and she told my cousin she was agressive. I told her ""Shes not aggressive, she gets way too much in other dogs faces and they don't like that and she takes the correction as a fight. And my mom freaks out way too much, making the situation worse."" 

When I explained that my cousin said ""Oh that makes sense. Its worse if one dog is on a leash too and the other is not"" 

I'm taking her to the renaissance fair and my mom is convinced I'm going to get her sued. She watches too much Judge Judy and follows too many horror story pages on facebook where all they post is dogs getting mauled by others and I think all that negativity made her believe Willow is some dangerous killing machine. We only had one incident years ago when we brought her to a dog park and some idiot decided it was a good idea to have their reactive dog growling and lunging outside of the fence so all the other dogs were like ""wtf is that?"" and she bit our other dog (he ended up being fine and I mostly blame the other owner for causing high tension and bringing a dog that should never be at a dog park (until he got some basic training or she learned to calm down ) to the park. 

My mom is making me take a choker collar, I fucking hate those things. But whatever if it makes her shut up and convinced she won't be sued or end up on a facebook page I'll put it in my bag and only use it if I defiantly have too.

tl;dr - My mom watches way too much Judge Judy and facebook groups where all they post is stories of dogs getting mauled or killed and she's convinced our dog is like that when she's just is reactive on a leash and she doesn't know anything about dog training a reactive dog.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713955,public,self,"My NMom is convinced our dog is aggressive, when she's not.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p8q2cs/my_nmom_is_convinced_our_dog_is_aggressive_when/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mom has been asking for a few months about visiting me over Christmas. I‘ve told her repeatedly that I’m not making any plans or promises and will need to settle into my host country. She kept bringing it up, and I kept telling her I didn’t have enough information and wasn’t ready to talk about it. Practically speaking, I don’t even know what my schedule will look like for winter break since I’ll be teaching at a new school. What I didn’t disclose is that I’ll be in a long distance relationship and was planning on meeting him in a neighboring country during that time period. The only way our relationship will work for him is if we see each other regularly, and Christmas break will be the longest amount of time we’d have for each other. 

Anyways, I just found out through the grapevine that my mom bought tickets for her and my dad to spend Christmas with  me back in May(!!!). This was back when the status of my placement was uncertain because of the pandemic, which means she got tickets before my visa and own plane ticket over here were sorted out. She just assumed she was invited.

I’m angry they booked tickets without coordinating with me first, and stressed because I don’t want to celebrate Christmas with them. During the three years I’ve lived overseas in the past, I only spent one Christmas with them, so it isn’t a “given” for our family.

I was planning on coming up with an adroit excuse to avoid a nasty argument. Now, it’s going to turn into a confrontation where I’m straight up rejecting the visit they already paid for, and also may face accusations of wasting their money.

My mother is the “you have to reflect well on me at all times” narc and I’ve historically been compliant and done everything her way (until my 20s or so). I’m now in my 40s. Working mom, wife, no drama, I don’t know how I could do any better than that. I haven’t even ever had as much as a speeding ticket. I don’t do things her way exclusively anymore, but while I’m autonomous, I’m not a disaster by any stretch of the imagination. I couldn’t even compete as an amateur at failing at life. 

My company put an ad in the paper yesterday for a receptionist at another branch *in another town.* The ad clearly said so and I’m not a receptionist. Still, the narc texted me around noon to ask if I were still working, because of the ad she thought I “might have gotten in trouble.” 

She assumed I’d been fired for no other reason than it was the same company! Granted, I’m low contact so she doesn’t know a lot about my job, but she knows I’m not a receptionist. All it took was for the name to be the same — ignore the address and job title — Papa Goulash HAD to have screwed up yet again and gotten herself fired!

I have a great job, wonderful family, no criminal record (and not just because I haven’t gotten caught haha), no bankruptcy, no nothing! I’m as boring and vanilla as it gets. I still reflect on her well, though that’s incidental now, but why does she always assume I’m an incompetent buffoon?

I don’t think I need to explain this isn’t the first time this has happened. There was also a time when she asked, “You’re on public assistance, aren’t you?” in front of my daughter. I’m NOWHERE near qualifying. NOWHERE.  When I moved out age 20, her last words to me in front of the U-Haul were, “Don’t get your lights turned off. You pay your bills!” One time she called me because she heard an ambulance in the distance going toward my town, because she assumed I’d “had an accident” and my then-toddler daughter was therefore left alone in the house.

I am financially cut off, severely depressed/anxiety, scared for my “future, been through years of suicide thoughts and pussy attempts of it (I’m terribly afraid of death and leaving my god siblings—only child by my mom), maniac episodes, tons of debt (student loans, parent plus loans etc which I know nothing about), credit card debt (narc mom never taught me the value of a dollar or finances just always said “you need to understand the value of a dollar, but go to Gucci and buy whatever you want as long as you have my permission).. etc etc the list goes on.

My lease ends on Monday, September 23 &amp; my narc mom cut me off basically as a daughter lol, she says I’m selfish and I have took up too much of her life/career. I honestly don’t know what to type because I don’t remember my trauma unless I have anxiety attacks or really intense manic episodes ... she blames me for my trauma since i apparently don’t understand what she had to go through. In a way she’s kind of correct because she was never there and had me bounce around her friends houses while growing up. I never knew what her profession was until I like 19/20 because for whatever reason but she runs her own PR agency (she used my FASFA to put money down on a mansion in Beverly Hills and blamed me when I wasn’t in classes lol).

I'm 22 now and just graduated. While I was still in college, my family moved across the country. Even though I missed my siblings and mom, I felt so free from my narcissistic dad. I still had to answer his calls or get reprimanded, but the distance helped me feel so much more at peace. I'm staying with them for the summer before I start my new job next month, and I recently signed a lease for a new apartment. I've always lived with roommates, and this is my first apartment alone so now my dad constantly tells me he's going to come stay with me. At first, he said, ""You're going to have a bed for me, right?"" And I said, ""Um, no? Where am I supposed to keep a random bed?"" And he went into the whole schpeal about how he raised me and I should welcome him at anytime. A couple of days later, he brought it up again and asked if I even love my family. And I just said yes, and he said, ""Well it seems like you don't want us around your apartment."" And I just said that I do (because I would love my family to come around, just not him). Then, he said, ""Are you going to have an office space for me?"" He knows that it's a one bedroom apartment. And I said, ""No, I don't even have an office for myself."" And he asked if I was going to have internet and I said yes. He said, ""That's all I need!"" And then he asked if I would give up my bed for him to sleep on and I sleep on the floor. And I just said I don't know, and then he went on again about how he's given up everything for me and the least I can give him is my bed. And then he said that my apartment ""better not"" have parking restrictions. I told him that it does, even I have to pay for monthly parking. And he said, ""Okay, I'll just fly and not drive. You can pick me up and drop me off. Even more for you to do for me."" This enraged me. I should have mentioned that I've never stood up to him. I've tried, and it always turn into a whine-fest and he ends up blaming my mom and screaming at her, so I just don't show much emotion anymore. Today, he brought it up again. He said that he's going to come visit me twice a month. He said, ""You're going to cook for me, right?"" And I just stared at him and he said, ""You know what kind of food I like. You can buy this and this and that and make food for me everyday."" I just shrugged him off. He says all the time that he has such high emotional intelligence and that he's this amazing person who everyone loves. Well, if that were true, he would see how miserable he makes our entire family. Nobody in my family likes him. My mom is only still with him because he used to threaten her all the time that if she ever left, he would take us away and she'd never see us again. Now that my youngest brother is in high school, I can tell that she's trying to save up money to be able to leave in a few years. I have been financially independent for a while now. He does not pay for anything. The fact that he thinks he's entitled to come stay with me and bother me and intrude on my life absolutely infuriates me.

No, that's minimizing it. I'd be pretty well off.

Alas, I'm feeling so stressed. And guess what? I buy things to help deal with the stress. I'm stuck at this freakin' apartment and I can only get out when my mother can take me out.

I thought I could survive without all my video game-related files. I thought I could survive without my video game-related hardware. I told myself that I wouldn't purchase the same things a fourth time after having sold them a third time. That all just wasn't so, though, and video games keep me occupied better than anything else being in here.

So I've immersed myself in certain hobbies even though I don't have the room in my apartment to truly partake in them. I can still purchase things related to them, though, and that'll perk me up and lessen the monotony of each and every day of my life.

I've had once in a lifetime opportunities for FREE MONEY and I ruined them by spending them on things that would have me feel better in the now. I can't possibly keep suffering until it all suddenly gets better. I'm trying so hard, too.

My emails to professors are not normal. The way that I've spoken on a school project Discord has not been normal, either.

I just want a real life. A lot of people seem to have an internal conflict with video games. Maybe, they're past them and they can't accept that. Maybe, they can't accept how the public views their interest. I don't know. Well, playing video games is a whole better for me than walking around this apartment all day or refreshing the same webpages over and over again. It's a whole lot more calming, too.

I don't know where I'd be without this stress, but I don't expect the world to stop for me. I'm trying so hard. My mother takes me for drives nearly every single day because she knows what those drives do for me.

As for why I'm posting this under my own name, that was part of my attempt to deal with the stress. It might seem selfish, but I tried to manage my ""online presence.""

I've tried for a few years to cut ties with my nparents but unable to get my head around it.

I'm 22, living with my parents and a sister, trying to find a job to get away from them as soon as possible. I live in a ""my house, my rules"" type of house but only applying to me and not my sister. I'm kind of the kid who is not talked about, asked to do everything, yelled at for no reason, having them go through my stuff when I'm not home, and the first they suspect for random things I didn't do. Next to me is my younger sister who is in medical studies, praised as the ""perfect child without a single flaw"".
Obviously, there is A LOT more going on, stuff more or less serious, but it has accumulated over the years and I contemplated the idea of cutting ties for good...
But here is the thing... Every time I try to cut ties, I say to myself ""But when we talk, we laugh together, they offers me gifts, I got a new pc, I get some pocket money here and there, they can't be so bad"" and just end up not doing anything in the end. I've tried to run away to my gf's house but I immediately said to myself ""But what if they didn't do anything wrong and I'm making it up? What if I'm really doing things wrong and they try to teach me the ways? They will know where I am, they will be furious at me""

After this text message from my mom and one short phone call, I got nothing from the rest of my family.

This has made my nmom unhappy and she has been whining about how dangerous it is to go back to work when the no. of Covid cases are still abit high in my country (about 30 cases/day). She kept criticising my employer for not knowing how to think and keep saying my company is lousy. Her over criticism really drove me up the wall. And she does this everyday when I go to work, and it messes up my thinking and frame of mind. And when I finally explode with frustration and anger at her constant criticism, she will smile slightly, as if she is happy that I am provoked. Also, when I come back from work, she will give me the cold shoulder treatment. It makes me so miserable because here I am, being the sole breadwinner and paying everything for us (bills, grocery, meals, and her monthly allowance) and yet I am treated like this. I feel like I am being punished for going to work. Although she was already narcissistic before the pandemic, she has been getting worse and worse.

Since young she has been dissuading me from making friends, she does not like me to socialise with others. And thus now I feel very isolated from society. And now her cold treatment makes me feel even more despair. I have no idea why she does this.

My nmom is somewhat a recluse. She does not like to go out, she does not like to go for holiday and we don't do the normal things other families do. I don't keep in touch with my cousins and I don't have friends to go out with. When I am sick, she will scold me and accuse me of being sick to attract attention and give me cold shoulder. I feel so lonely as a result and when I go out, I go out alone as my mum does not like to go out. However, whenever we are out, she will scold me in public and throw tantrum (by shouting, sulking and saying unreasonable things). I feel like I can't even go out with her like other normal families. And this makes me even more alone and frustrated.

I have tried to tell nmom what I feel, but she will scold me for having my own thoughts and opinions.

I was raised in a cult. I can finally call it that after years of being away from it. I was forced to wear little house on the prairie clothes, I was homeschooled and most of the time my parents had church at their house. When they didn’t they ran off every friend I ever made by pushing their religion on everyone. I was a super big animal lover and when strays would come, my ndad would beat them in the head with a club til they died. I’ll never forget hiding under my bed hearing the cries of the animals he would abuse. I was not allowed to have Christmas Easter Halloween, no holidays whatsoever. Birthdays were allowed til I was 13. When I was 8, my mom started sending me outside into the woods nearby our home by myself to play. She just didn’t wanna deal with me. I developed a mental illness that I’m still dealing with today. I can barely go outside my own home. 
My question starts with this. I was recently (a year ago) hospitalized for my mental illness. My husband and I were working on out relationships due taking a break so I moved in with my parents. I genuinely wanted to be religious but when I told my NDA’s he started making all these rules. I am 36 mins you. I had to go to his church that I share no beliefs with, I have to “cover up” so I don’t “tempt” him, ie I have to have a shirt up to my neck and some type of sleeves, and I have to defer to him and my mother at all times, do what they say, never raise my voice. Well long story short me and my husband got back together and I told my mom off. I told her she’s going to a nursing home and that she better watch how she talks to me, but I sadly do not have the backbone to address the religious stuff. I’m still in low contact with them becaus due to my disability, I do not work, and they support me. I am torn because one day I wanna cut them off bmy t they have done so much for me at the same time.

I remember her always teaching other's kids (especially her then boyfriend's kids) how to cook, playing with them outside and overall acting as the perfect mother for them (especially if those kids had shitty mom's). But when it came to me, it seems like the only thing she taught me was how to clean. 

And whenever I brought up that she acted more like a mother figure to other kids more than me, it was always the same generic excuse; ""They need me more, they're not as lucky as you.""  And it's just like, I needed you too, mom. Moreso because YOU'RE my mom, and if it mattered that much to her then she should help those kids by getting someone who could pull them out of that situation (of which I do admit, some of their situations were down right terrible and if I would have understood at the time, would have called CPS/social services at best and told a teacher or something at school at worst) rather than just try to step in as mom and only give them small amounts of normalcy.

But -- my dad was the one who walked me through cooking/how to cook (and not just tell me to read the box), taught me how to drive, etc. And when i would mention this whenever she said she was such a fantastic parent who taught me so much, she would always say something to the effect of, ""Well that's what a parent's supposed to do, and your dad's supposed to teach you those things."" Which hurts, because I've ALWAYs heard stories from others about memories they've had with their parents, of cooking with their moms at a young age, of getting help with things such as going to the DMV or courthouse or insurance places or what have you; basically things parents are SUPPOSED to do for/with their children, whereas I only remember being told I have to do it myself because how else would I learn, right? I also have autism, so anything that needed to be done socially/in person I always had an anxiety/panic attack over and often got yelled at for my emotions and couldn't react like a person.

A lot of the time -- and the TL;DR version of it, too, I guess -- I often just wish I had those memories of my mom, and had someone with me in several circumstances (especially so when I didn't feel unsafe doing it alone and was there to make me feel safe) who could guide me through it rather than trying to figure things out with a complete stranger who was probably already having a bad day I only made worse because my parent wouldn't be a parent.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713944,public,self,Other Kids Need Them More?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p8nvjl/other_kids_need_them_more/,some_ads,7,supporturgent,b4c5598c-82c9-11e3-9642-12313d27e9a3,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

I posted some of this as a comment on another thread and realized that I CLEARLY have more to process than is single comment worthy.  I am incredibly overwhelmed trying to figure out divorcing my abusive narcissist ex who I literally fled from 6 years ago and haven't spoken to since. We got married in 2008,  less than 2 weeks after my 21rst birthday.  I left in mid 2015. We never legally separated, I just walked out the door.  His abuse, isolation and manipulation were immensely destructive and have had a long lasting effect on my life since. The abuse was largely emotional and verbal and I have no proof/police reports etc with which to substantiate the torment I lived under from 18-28 years old. That decade of my life left me heavily traumatized and  I have been too afraid to face anything having to do with him since I left even though it has led to massive economic struggle and a generally very unstable life.  I am afraid that no DV organization will help me because they have limited resources and worse crisis acuity. it has been 6 years, I never documented the occasional physical abuse, and I have safe and stable housing now/am relatively 'safe' from him in another state (though only 3 1/2 hours away, a fact that makes me panic if I think about it too hard.) I am in 6 figure student loan debt for an extremely low demand BA that I will never use and was pressured by him into getting. The bulk of the loans went to living expenses in a VERY HCOL city .  He came from a well off family and 'was used to a certain standard'.(How many couples who were full time students in 2015 paid $1700 for a 1 bedroom apartment when only one of them had a job and it was a retail supervisor gig...PS that one was ME! Unlike mine, his studies were always deemed too important for him to work.)  I was 21, legally married, being constantly screamed at, insulted and berated, don't drive due to a disability, had no close family, was 15 hours from what little distant and struggling Nfamily I did have, and felt I had no choice but to agree to the loans in order to keep the peace because I felt genuinely trapped.  He always told me 'his family would take care of it' and I was too traumatized to question things. Borrowing the money meant less fighting and less fighting meant less hearing that I was white trash who should kill herself. Meanwhile, this year I made just a squeak over $30k for the first time. He has since continued his education in physics and engineering and now makes six figures.  According to a message request I received recently on Facebook, he seems to think that, despite what he put me through,  things could ever be so civil that I would ' just shoot him a text' and 'work together to  get this over with quickly and move on with our lives.' I know that his intense narcissism is leading him to minimize what he did to me into, ""we were young and made the wrong decision"", which, as a friend put it, ""is AN adult perspective to have on the situation....but not the right one, considering  trauma from abuse that he inflicted"". This man gave me severe  CPTSD that I have never been able to afford treatment for. I still don't feel entirely comfortable around men other than my partner. I don't even say my ex's first name in my home, like it is a curse. For now I'm still stuck with his last name and it makes me sick to say it, read it, write it every day at this point. I am worried that I can't even remotely  afford a lawyer when he clearly can. I make just barely too much to qualify for reduced fee legal aid in my state. I don't know how to explain or get anyone to take seriously the fact that I cannot and will not speak to him myself even though I no longer feel physically endangered by him. That said, I am willing to deal with mediation as long as I never have to deal with him directly in any way.  The last thing I have the energy for is another long fight with the worst monster I have known. I have very little in the way of  friend or family support or material resources (a fact he constantly readily exploited and used against me) and basically I'm just....scared and overwhelmed. I keep thinking that if I hadn't been raised by NMom and had family that really loved and cared about me, I would have both had support  and an understanding that I didn't  deserve what was happening to me and this nightmare could have been over so much sooner. For years now, I have blessed to have the unconditional deep love and support of an AMAZING partner,  who has healed every psychic wound he could and helped me rebuild a sense of self worth. I  owe it to both of us to finally close this awful chapter and move on, but I don't even know where to start.

Being on this sub often leaves me feeling like my parents weren´t that bad. Such horrible stuff many of you have gone through, I´ve never been physically hurt, abandoned or violated.

That being said I was so dumbfounded watching the Dr Phil episode, my mother used to use the same tactics while being confronted (I gave up confronting her a long time ago), like:

\- When questioning her to understand her behavior, she made it about her, talking about how she was a victim and trying her best.

\- Overly religious talk... making her out as a redeemed saint.

\- ""I don´t remember that."" When confronted with what she said or did.

\- The ""It was beyond my control"" attitude.

&amp;#x200B;

The mothers mannerism and phrasing gave me chills because I remember exactly the same thing from my mother. When she justified not helping me with my newborn child after promising she would help me the first year, convincing me not to get an abortion and leaving me a single mother in a different country. Not showing up for the christening, even if it was she who chose the date, because my 18 year old brother was starting school three days after that. Telling me and my family I had become ""dark, unpure and gone to the dark side"" after I met my boyfriend when I was 21, still pressing me to get enganged and married because it´s the christian thing to do. Saying I was Moses recarnated when I was on her good side, and that my virginity was protecting the country when I was younger. Gee thanks. Tip of the iceberg of the religious talk. Telling me my dad molested my sister when she was an infant and somehow turning me into the bad person when I wanted this topic discussed by the whole family.

Telling me super intimate stuff about her relationship with my dad when I was way to young, using me as a therapist because she didn´t feel comfortable to open up to anybody else. ""You´re such a good listener."" Her number one activity with me was driving around and talking.

And today I realise even if my father is not a manipulative person he enabled her to be this way. He is just as self-absorbed, only talking about himself for hours if I let him when we talk.

It just breaks me to not have any family to lean on. My biggest trigger in life is seeing good parents who are there for their kids. Or grandparents or any family member. And I feel people who don´t have narcissistic parents don´t seem to be able to fathom the concept. I keep hearing from friends; well she is your mother you got to make things right. So even if she lied about me owing her money, and she was not able to prove it in any way I still payed. Because of pressure from friends to do it for the sake of family.

I wish there was an adoption service for grownups who were raised by narcissists. It´s just such a terrible lonely feeling not having any family. Well, yes I have a family  technically  but I hope you know what I mean. And I´m so sad for my children. Having great grandparents can give you so much but my parents never even ask about them the just start ranting about themselves and their problems.

I've read through many threads and can relate and sympathize with a lot of what you've all been through. I don't want to bore anyone with every detail of my life story so I'll just try to stick to some of the main general points, but it's still quite a long story so please bear with me. I am well aware that we shouldn't be trying to diagnose, but mom makes excuses to not go to therapy and we have constant issues every few months even though I've moved out. So in a way this is my way of venting and I appreciate whoever reads it.

I lost my dad at age five to a heart attack and mother enmeshed me because she seems to see my father in me. She met someone new about 2 years after his passing and she began to drink a lot when she would go out with him every weekend and come home until 5am. I would usually be babysat by a cousin who was like 14 at the time although she would call to check up and leave food. Eventually her new man moved in with us 5 years later and it always seemed that he would try to compete with me for affection and sometimes quite frankly resent me a bit, there was snide comments here and there and friction. He wasn't completely terrible, but has an abrasive personality that people tend to dislike definitely arrogant and narcisstic due to his success. I never disrespected him and accepted him and was eager to have a half sibling. 

Mother started having issues with him after first sibling was born. She always had very little if any boundaries with me and shared way too many details including intimate. I was exposed to quite a few inappropriate things that I shouldn't have heard or been told. It sometimes came from the step dad too, mind you this guy would sometimes come out of the shower naked and not care when he would forget his towel. Mother also had an explosive temper and would yell at me constantly over any mistake I made no matter how trivial. Mistakes that kids make like forgetting something when she sent me to the store. There were times she'd get so angry over something she would pull my hair or throw things at me and cuss me out  and sometimes say things like useless good for nothing. To the point even the step-dad would sometimes be the voice of reason.

Almost everyday seemed to be constant yelling from her. I was constantly anxious from hearing her yelling or slamming things when she'd be angry cleaning. She was a stay at home mom since I was born and when I asked what was wrong it was always about having to do so much cleaning and cooking and not being helped enough and how she sacrificed herself and was not appreciated. When I would try to help everything I did was wrong and I would never get a thank you. Even step dad would say thank you when I would help him. During age 11 to 15 I feel that she constantly put me down and it made me feel that she was embarrassed of me. She only started complementing me when I became a bodybuilder from 22 to 24. She is very paranoid and overprotective and would not let me go out much and would constantly call me or my friends when I'd go out.

This made afraid and unable to be more independent because I would get anxious about going out and talking to people. After my 2nd sibling was born step dad bought her a house and I helped with 3k for the down payment and moved with them at 19. I struggled to find work in 2008 to 2009 so it caused some fights. She would defend me from step dad berating me or telling me I should move out at 18. So no not everything was negative. She seems to want to get a long and it's like she has two husband's sometimes. She comes to me for support and for helping raise my siblings and to offer them advice because apparently her husband doesn't care enough.

She found him texting other women twice and instead of leaving began to drink more and went back to him. Eventually we had an argument and he kicked me out for sleeping in the same bedroom with my girlfriend in his house, but then apologized which is his MO with everything he does. I was finishing college and was at home until 27 which was my mistake, but I got a full time job and moved out with my SO. We offered mom help to leave him or a place to live if needed, but she said no. We don't feel comfortable going over after what he said to us and this hurts mom because she misses us and wants us to come over. (She's a good company when she's not angry or drinking and getting emotional).  I had to instill strict boundaries because despite the damage she wanted to undo with my relationship to step-dad she would still call me to vent.

She is constantly telling me she is hurt because I rarely call or text when I have told her multiple times I don't want to go to the house despite the fact he apologized and would prefer for us to spend time in person and in a neutral place. She never wants to go out and almost always rejects invites because she always says she feels ill. (We never got to go out much since I was 10 because she was always tired or sick) there was times I was not allowed to go anywhere because she didn't feel good. At this point I don't know what to do. She has respected the boundary of not venting to me about her husband anymore after a few strong arguments we had, but she doesn't understand I prefer to do things in person with her or anyone for that matter. Are these issues because she doesn't know how to handle her relationship with her husband and is codependent? A mix of all? At this point what are my options besides boundaries? Will we ever have a healthy relationship?

The animals require already a lot of care just solely from the cleaning and feeding (my mother feeds them homemade meals that I manually have to cook), and combined with the fact that my stepfather is overworking and my 5 year old brother is overwhelming to take care of, my mother readily relied on my whole summer break to care for her pets. She expects 12 hours of my time to literally cook, feed, and clean for her half of her pets. When I refuse to help due to mental and physical stress, or even time for my own stuff such as studying, she makes some melodramatic excuses about how I am ungrateful for her raising me for 20 years, how she treats me so nicely financially, how if I wasn't born she wouldn't have to suffered in my birth country, how the animals are her only enjoyment in life, how she is constantly suffering etc. 

Even a week ago when I was supposed to return to college campus, she made the same excuses and told me to leave, but expect to cut ties with her, even saying that she will not care if I end up somewhere dead, which truly hurt my feelings because she knows that she is the only family I have here and she knows that I have always sacrificed everything as much as I can because she is my mother and I love her. This event obviously forced me to stay and continue toiling away, wasting the one week I had to prepare for an entrance exam and other preparations in college. 

This summer has been absolutely hell and truly horrid. I remember a day when the whole family was eating sushi at the dining table, I just broke down crying. My stepfather laughed if I was depressed of leaving home, and my mother said I must be crying because of the wasabi...and I just laughed how it was the wasabi that got me. Another day my mother screamed how she should have never given birth to me because I can’t take care of 20+ dogs; later that day, my brother casually joked how I should go back to campus or go die (literally). I can't recall how many times I thought of just ending my life if I am just that worthless, etc. My girlfriend who I confided this to told me how manipulative and neglectful of my mother to toy with my emotions and mental health to get what she wants, but I can't stop justifying my mother's actions be using reasons such as myself being a burden, she is not in a healthy relationship/mental being, that I lived with my parents rent free for 3 months, until I can't take it anymore like right now. 

Do I really deserve to be treated like this just for existing?

My mom has always been there for me. Through my toughest moments. And with those moment come her moments. And all my life she has painted my father to be the most villainous character. Which my father is a former drill instructor for the military and has on multiple occasions called me a faker for my PTSD, my paranoid schizoaffective disorder, and my bipolar disorder.
My mother has always been my rock. But as she gets older; she gets meaner.
What I mean by that is that she wakes up in her chair angry. She wakes up mad at the world on some days and cheerful on others. I get pits in my stomach questioning if she is ever going to wake up in a good mood or not.

We lost Grandma this month and I've felt nothing towards the death but numbness. And my mom? She was just as numb. But it was cancer and we couldn't do anything about it 

Today? She had some strange melt down. I mean collected grief and melt down.
She woke up in a pissy mood and I thought it's just one of those days. But she gets worse throughout the day.

L: Wanna watch the news? We can watch how all the taliban are coming to r**e America including [my name.]

That word is a violent trigger of mine. My dad and I were confused. But she kept arguing with us and eventually started throwing brand new bowls into the sink, slamming cups around, screaming profanity, and talk about how I'm a slob. Which we tried to calm her.
She stops. But she moves on to destroy her miniature perfume collection she collected for 20+ years. Destroying the holders for them and shattering legit gold. She loved those perfumes.

She then started cursing my dead grandmother's name. Swearing up and down that grandma destroyed my mom and calling my grandmother the C word.

She then tried to break the blinds and self harm. Take medication. Beat on my father who only lied his hands on her to get her to spit out the pills. She screams at the top of her lungs.

My nparents are very child-like and most of the time behave as such. Being out in public with them always makes me very anxious because they are often atrociously rude and if I don't keep them in line, they'll either hurt others and make me look like an asshole, and I refuse to let that happen.

We got invited to one of my second cousin's wedding. I almost didn't go because I am in early recovery from alcoholism, and my parents were going. I ended up sucking it up because my cousin is such a good guy and really wanted me to be there.

My parents talked through the entire ceremony. On and on and on until I finally jabbed my mother with my elbow and stared them down until the message got across. Then, at dinner as the waiters were going around confirming everyone's order, my dad out of no where started asking the waiter how the steak was cooked and was insisting that they cook mine a different way. I initially thought he was talking about his own steak, but he confirmed he was ordering salmon. He kept going on and on, so I put my hand up signaling him to stop talking, which he ignored. So, I cut him off and told the waiter to please not listen to him and to give me the steak as is. The waiter nervously laughed and walked away, because he could tell I was infuriated. I told my dad that I am capable of ordering on my own and that I think its rude to make ridiculous requests when the waiters were busting their assess to serve all 200 guests their meals. He just sat there and said nothing, pretending it never happened like children do.

Pretty much for as long as I can remember, I've been absolutely petrified of the idea of singing out loud in front of people. I mean, it is probably my biggest fear in life. Like even singing with other kids in elementary school choir was terrifying to me, and even today, decades later, I can't sing along to a song with my friends in the car without feeling extremely self-conscious. The fear is \*that\* bad. 

But I never really stopped to think about WHY that is, until recently. My theory is this: 

When I was a little kid (probably 5 or 6 years old), Ndad started pushing me to play music, because he himself played music and was a singer, so of course he wanted me to do that too. And anything that I did, Ndad had to be 110% involved with, because nothing was purely mine, it was also his too because he owned me. He did this with pretty much all of my hobbies. I just wanted something that was MINE and to not have Ndad trying to be involved. So maybe my fear of singing stems from that?

The thing is, I actually have a pretty decent singing voice, and it feels like my intense fear is making that go to waste.

This is a long one. Obligatory sorry for formatting I’m on mobile.

For some context, I turned 18 several months ago. Due to disabilities, the school programme I was in before I graduated, and a planned trip out of state, I don’t have a job. I’m working on it, but at this point in time I am not able to financially support myself and I still live at home. I also can’t drive (still learning, very nervous after a car accident I was in).

Both of my parents, but my mom especially, are neglectful regarding medical treatment. We are an upper-middle class family. My parents have over a million in savings, and we go on nice yearly vacations. There is no excuse.

Things have been better since I graduated because my mom’s main “reason” for not believing me was because she thought I wanted to get out of going to school.

About three days ago I started having unexplained left-side chest pain. I worked up the courage and asked my mom if I could get an appointment with my GP, she said yes and I went to my GP yesterday.

They did some blood work and said it’s likely anxiety (I have an anxiety disorder). On the paperwork they sent me, it said to go to the ER or call 911 if symptoms worsened.

A few hours after the appointment, my chest pain worsened. I had increased pain, moving in certain ways was painful, and I couldn’t get in a full breath.

I texted my mom asking her to take me to urgent care (this was before we received the document from the GP). My mom said no and had me come lay downstairs with her and my dad (this is when we received the document electronically. My mom is the one who got it and I sent it to myself on her phone.) 

When I read that I should be going to the ER, I started to speak up for myself a bit more. I told them I don’t feel well, I’m in pain, and I’m having trouble breathing. My mom said I wasn’t in “respiratory distress” and that she was right there and could see I wasn’t having trouble breathing (I would estimate I was breathing 20-30 times a minute, normal is 12-16. I also couldn’t talk for very long without stopping to catch my breath.)

Both my parents told me that if it’s so bad that I have to go to urgent care, then I would have to tell my friend’s mom I couldn’t pet sit tomorrow. Which is another attempt at trying to guilt trip me, but my friend’s mom is practically my mom and is very understanding so it was no problem.

My dad started guilt tripping me because “the hospitals are full with COVID patients.”, “the doctors are overwhelmed with COVID.” And that I “would be taking a bed from someone who needs it”. I called him out on guilt tripping and he said he was “just stating facts.”

I eventually argued with them enough that my mom said “Fine. I’ll take you to urgent care.” And my dad asked me if I “really wanted to do this when the hospitals are overrun.”

My mom and I go to urgent care. She is clearly pissed, but turns into the “concerned mom” once we get to urgent care. We are checking in and she says “why don’t you sit down while we wait.” Luckily I know her BS so once she got to the front of the line, I got up and stood with her to check me in. By a turn of fate, turns out we needed my ID, so my mom went back to get it. At this point, I inform the one of the women at the front desk that my GP said I should go to the ER or call 911 if my symptoms worsened. They jump me up the line and I am taken in to get an EKG.

I told the nurse and the doctor what my GP said. They asked me why I was at urgent care and not the ER. I inform them that my mom is Just Like That and that she wasn’t even going to take me here. I was crying while telling her this.

When my mom gets back, she is taken into the room with me. The doctor chews her out. Tells her if my GP says that I should go to the ER or call 911 if symptoms worsen, then I should be at the ER right now and “I know it’s none of my business, but your kid is obviously afraid of you and that’s not okay.” She tells my mom either she can drive me to the ER or they can call 911 to take me.

My mom chooses to drive me to the ER. When we got in the car she tells me that “It really hurt my feelings when you told the doctor you’re scared of me.” I told her “I don’t care. I didn’t. She realized that herself. You have been doing this to my medical stuff for years and you finally got told you were wrong.” After which she was quiet.

At the ER, I eventually make her leave. I told her to go home and I don’t want her their she said “but I want to be here and make sure you’re okay.” I got pissed off enough and told her “~I~ don’t want you here. Leave.” She left. I’m lucky I’m 18 otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to. If she didn’t leave I think I would have had to get security to get her to leave.

After she leaves, breathing gets really hard. I collapsed when I got up after they called my name. I get chest x-rays, they look at the EKG I got at urgent care, take blood, and give me an IV and some fluids. It’s nothing immediately concerning. Nothing wrong on the chest x-ray, EKG is normal, heart sounds normal. They don’t know what’s wrong. I got referred to a cardiologist and I need to make that appointment.

My mom comes and gets me from the ER at about 1am. She pretends everything is fine in the car. None of us have talked about the whole situation. I don’t know how to address it or if I should. 

My chest pain is still there, but I got a prescription for a lot of ibuprofen. It hasn’t gotten worse. Moving around is still uncomfortable, but I’m okay.

I’m in the process of buying my first house. I held off on telling my grandparents (notorious flying monkeys) until all the inspections were done, because they’re incredibly negative and they would have made me more nervous. I honestly only told them because I didn’t want to do it too close to moving time or try to keep it a secret and face the barrage of “why don’t you tell us anything?” Etc. 

My grandma (mom’s mom) and I used to be extremely close before I moved out and went NC. Now she is a textbook flying monkey, but our old relationship makes it hard to keep an info diet. In my excitement, I sent her the Zillow link and told her some details. 

Flash forward the next day, my nMom has my new address and makes comments about the house to my brother. She is now acting distraught because she’ll never be allowed in my house, blah blah. 

And it just makes me never want to have a big life event again. Like, why have a wedding when it’ll be overshadowed by family members who think I’m evil for not inviting my parents? Why have kids when she might go to extremes to contact them and fuck them up too?  It’s just so frustrating that NC is NOT the freedom I thought it would be. It’s almost worse, like it’s a perverse game and my nparents have gotten good at playing. 

I know, at the end of the day, I can and will still do anything I want.

My step-mother (aka my Mama) and my older sister (I'll just call her sister as I rarely speak to my younger sister) were in town yesterday and decided to surprise me and pick me up from work so we can all 'hang out', and then they'd come over to check out my new place. I was so excited, they live a town over so I rarely see them in person anymore as I don't drive (massive anxiety issues) and they're always too busy to come out my way. Our last official 'hang out' was Thanksgiving last year, I've seen them both in person once since. So this was something I was absolutely over the moon about, time with my Mama and sister, a treat! 

Boy, was I wrong.

Their idea of a 'hangout' was to drag me to a high end lingerie store so they could shop for over 2 hours (I'm ftm, although still in the closet, so lacey bras and panties ain't my thing lol). The whole time they talked to me for all of 10 minutes, mostly just to inquire about the things my NMom had said n whatnot. I was just so uncomfortable and awkward the whole time, I had just gotten off an 8 hour shift and still had to get up at 4am Friday morning for work.  They were both having a better time and obviously getting along so much better than with me, I felt like such a third wheel. And then because they spent so much time shopping, they barely had time to check out my new place as they had to head back home as they had plans for the evening.

And then the most heartbreaking thing for me was that they basically told me that if I ever wanted to do a day trip, or go off-roading with them anytime in the future that I had to bus to their city (easily almost 2 hours one way) because I was too far of a drive for them and it was too tiring to get me if they had to do the driving for the trip all day, and of course gas would be too much (even though I offered to pay for some of it). It's like a 30-45 minute drive to my place, so like I can understand where they're coming from, but ouch. My Mama has posted her near daily travels here, there, and everywhere in our local areas over the pandemic, she's an avid hiker, it's how her and my dad met. And my sister never goes anywhere, she's a bit of a homebody for the most part. But like, I know I shouldn't expect people to drive me everywhere, but with them telling me that I'm basically too much of a hassle to get and I have to do all that to earn their time, it fucking hurts. They've barely spent time with me anyways because of the pandemic, it's always been a hassle trying to plan anything with anyone because of conflicting schedules, so I've just stopped trying. I feel like a burden, an afterthought, and they were supposed to be my support, we all grew closer after my dad died, so I thought at least. 

And that's where I feel so conflicted. The person I'm supposed to hate, My NMom, was nothing but attentive, supportive, and dare I say loving during our visit. My Mama and sister spent more time together even when they had me around, barely talked to me, and were rushing to drop me off and leave. I had to  ask for a hug, I think they wouldn't have said 'I love you' if I hadn't had said it first. My NMom hugged me twice and kept reminding me how much she loved me the whole time. I know it might be manipulation, a front, but with how the family I've chosen to stay in contact with is acting right now, it's fucking working. 

I'm so confused, so lost and hurt. I don't know what to do, my head's a mess and I'm so overwhelmed my brain's been on autopilot all week. I feel like a burden, like my Mama and sister would be better off without me, I'm tired of having to fight for people's love and attention. I feel so alone.

I'm starting my senior year.
I'm on SSI.

My Nmom, (who I honestly feel bad for because narcism is technically a trauma response. Tho that is no excuse for how she has treated me my entire life) will soon have no control over me.

But it's like she knows my main reason for wanting to go to dorms is to get away from her.

Shes getting worse by the day and she's also yelling at my dad as well.
He has enabled her for years, but his parents from what ive heard were pretty bad as well. (They passed well before I was born)

I just don't know wether to be excited or upset or mad.

My plan once I'm out is to go low contact.

I don't plan on ever going no contact because as my brother proved when he moved out, she's actually pretty okay when you don't LIVE WITH her.

My head's just a mess.

I keep second guessing myself.

Senior year starts in two days.
I holed myself up in my room all day with the excuse ""my head hurts"" because from the second I woke up she was yelling at me.

Idk I'm just a mess rn

But I'll be out soon.

And I'll be able to live MY life. And I'll gain some more social skills, well, back anyway my mother tore down the ones my brother's ex fiance-current gf/baby momma had helped me build.

I don't know what to do. Do I permanently cut him off? In my eyes, everything he's done over the years is irredeemable.

Only recently, with my newfound freedom and being away from my place of abuse, am I learning the extant of my issues and where they lead back to. This is my first time posting on this sub, and first time reaching out on a forum about this.

I've been doing Low Contact with my mother for a while, and visiting for a weekend once every 6-8 weeks (mostly to see my dogs and friends in the area). Last year I had to stay there over Christmas break, and it absolutely fucked me. I started the next semester regressed and depressed. Due to reasons, I had to leave dorms for a week and go back home. This was greatly distressing, and I talked to some friends, and my sister about it, and what I should do. That in of itself was a big step for me as prior I had never talked about my issues at home before. At the time its what was normal.

The plan was to politely, but assertively set some basic boundaries and try to get along. Like please don't burst into my room while I'm working, please knock. That was 'respected' twice and was more akin to door pounding than knocking. The third time, I said I was busy at the moment, so she opened the door anyways telling me how she thought this was stupid, that she was my mother and it was her house, that she didn't see why I was treating her like this 'its not like I'm beating you'. I said yeah, but you used to. She walked away.

So then with that, and the larger fact that I felt like a frog slowly being boiled by staying in that house, I decided it wasn't going to work and that I would leave, for the sake of my own mental health. I told her that I was just staying for the weekend, and for the rest of the week I was going to stay with my (nonexistent) boyfriend. She didn't react. I guess me coming out and leaving early cancelled each other out. As I was packing my things she asked, 'are we good?' I told her that it was difficult for me to stay here for long periods of time, that there were some bad memories here (I gave a few examples, she had no memory ofc), that I didn't think of her as a complete black/white villain but I think after the divorce she was very angry and often took it out on me, that despite that I was still trying to 'make it work' with boundaries and that I wasn't going no contact like my sister had and that that should be appreciated at least.

Her response? That since I had so many bad memories here she guesses she should sell the house then. Then, a pseudo apology of im sorry IF, then into a YEAH I was angry ykno your father... I wasn't going to hear anymore and I cut her off and left. Stayed at a shitty motel for a little bit then drove a distance to my Dads. Talked to him about things and have since been taking the time to work through shit.

To briefly paint a picture from where I'm coming from, my early childhood&lt;5 was alright. I spent most of the time in after-care centers as both my parents worked, but it was alright. When I was 5, my parents started fighting, and by 6 they were divorced. I liked my Father a lot more, but it was my Mom who got custody. The rug got pulled out from under me. (During the divorce she accused my Dad of all sorts of false heinous shit, no low she wouldn't stoop to)

Then, I was alone with her, and things started to get worse. I was, and am, still a lot like my Father. She hated him, I reminded her of him, and so she hated me. She tried hard to change me. Dragging me to various doctors and therapists to medicate me and find out what was wrong with me. Of course, the issue never was the home life, it was ADHD, ADD, Aspergers, or many a other of various label.

I got sent to a psych ward (not for cutting or suicide attempts, she never noticed that. I had stopped cutting at this time and was just beginning to develop 'healthier' copes like dissociating and escapism) for stargazing on the roof of our 1story house. Afraid I was going to jump onto the grass and kill myself.. Being surrounded by properly fucked up people and stuck in a small room for majority of the week wasn't too fun at ~13 I got sent to a bootcamp a year later for reasons I still don't know. She still maintains she thought it was like a Boy Scout camp! Their website and marketing did nothing to imply such things. Also wasnt too fun.

She was emotionally and verbally abusive. One time in Elementary, I was being bullied and tried to confide in her about it. She asked, what were they saying? I told her and she laughed! She thought it was hilarious and then echoed back to me the same words my bullies were saying to me on the school yard. She told me I had to learn to laugh at myself, and I was being too sensitive. She became one of my bullies that day. Some phrases that are burned in deep, and that I echo to myself; ""I hate you"" ""I wish I never had you"". She'd call me names too, most frequently ""little shit"" and funnily ""son of a bitch"" (lol).

She was physically abusive. I watched her beat my Grandma and my dogs. She had no hesitations to smack me, or if I was making a fuss in a restaurant to take me outside and beat me. This didn't last as long as the emotional abuse as I got to be a tall kid quickly. But I remember when it stopped; She was chasing me through the house with a rolling pin like some shit from looney tunes, I ran into my room, got to the far end of my bed to have a barrier, she came at me, I kicked her away. She then flipped modes like a switch and started to weep and said I was going to kill her.

If we got into an argument or if my grades were low she wouldn't hesitate to throw my computer games into the water behind our house (learned to pirate tho :). Once she took a bat to my computer because I was spending too much time on it. She accused it of being my god lmao.

She was, and is, controlling. She has looked through my phone and texts. When I got a girlfriend she did not approve and encouraged me to break up with her. She unapologetically read through my childhood journal. Every science fair project as a child was a fight for control. I wanted to do science, but 'I would've done it wrong.' It was her idea, her way.

These things, I've been coming to learn, have affected me in the following ways (not exhaustive, still learning): I am completely clueless as to what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like. I have a bad track record with dating narcissists and rejecting (or rather avoiding) the love of genuine, kind people, because it is unfamiliar and alien to me.

Self-harm. I never learned much how to process my emotions. I did my best to suppress them, but painful emotions in particular would knock down the walls I built and flood me. When they did, not being able to process them internally, I learned to cut myself so I could at least process them physically. With age I tried to stop this because I knew it was unhealthy, but I learned I'll just subconsciously swap vices, such as knowingly going into dangerous situations so I could get hurt by others, or substance abuse (spent a year abusing psychs just fucking my mind up). I also tried to kill myself twice.

Emotionally Avoidant. Although I desire it greatly, I am scared of emotional intimacy. I have a tendency of once getting close to a partner or friend, distancing myself from them, or acting shitty towards them so they will stop caring about me and leave me alone. I have a deep subconscious belief that I am not deserving of love or care.

What I've done so far: I've been meditating and introspecting a lot. I have learned to practice self love, and positive self talk. I am now able to comfort myself, and encourage myself. I've learned to talk about my problems with trusted friends, I still get distant for a bit after I do, but they are patient and I come back to them. The 'distant' periods are gradually getting shorter. I've been reading a lot and doing general self development work. I'm currently reading ""The Emotionally Absent Mother"" by Jasmin Lee Cori. It's been a difficult book to get through, but I've been able to identify the things I need to work on, and why I am the way I am. It's been greatly helpful so far and I encourage others in similar situations to give it a read.

What I plan to do: Free myself; financially, cellularly, and on the internet. Close completely my old 'shared' checking account (have already opened my own at a different bank). Get my own cell provider. Purge all internet accounts that my Mother is aware of. Also I have been hunting for a therapist, I've been calling for one each day, but my insurance isn't great and it's been a slog.

What I'm still grappling with: Finding a substitute / cure for self-harm tendencies. I've noticed if I don't consciously engage I will subconsciously find ways to hurt myself when things get shitty. I've been practicing more self-love and these desires have been reduced, but I still worry about relapsing the next time I get a depressive episode.

How to prepare myself for actually dating and being a good partner? It's very important for me to get over my attachment issues, and from reading it seems one of the best ways to do so is to develop a secure attachment with someone. Most commonly these are done through intimate relationships, but I feel wholly incompetent, and in my experience I either get hurt or hurt the other person, so I have been avoiding this aspect of life.

Going Low Contact or No Contact. I still have friends in the area around my home that I like to see, which would be much harder to do without having a place to stay. I also miss my dogs very much, and I mostly have been visiting home for them. But at this point NC seems best.

He got accepted to the masters engineering program at TAMU, and my Family happily celebrated….now saying everyone in the family should now be an Aggie because they are finally having an Aggie! 🙄 
I am a year away from graduating with my undergrad, and they are telling me I should go to TAMU to do my masters. I basically told them no, that I rather go to UT arch now since after research it’s the best public school in Texas. I even told them that since I was a 17 year old kid they destroyed my dreams of ever wanting to go to that school now and I don’t want anything to do with TAMU after what happened.
We are dropping my brother off today, and I can’t help but feel like I am an asshole because my mom keeps asking why I am not happy for my brother. Honestly, I just feel very mad that my parents made me sacrifice going there 5 years ago and when my brother got accepted to the university  it’s suddenly so great and all the kids in the family should go. I am usually forgiving, but when it comes to this i get really emotional/teary eyed that I can’t forgive my parents. It fucking sucks hearing them talk about how great the university is when I could have gone there a long time ago. How do you guys think I should combat this feeling I have? Am I being an Asshole?

Edit: 
I gotta add, I am relatively close to my brother. I just feel like there been distance between us ever since he graduated and got accepted to TAMU. He’s been talking down to me more lately, and It feels like the TAMU thing is just a big rub in my face like: yes I won. I am going to TAMU, and you didn’t. I graduated first from college, and you are the older twin type of shit.

Rather difficult to get along with.  We have both roughly agreed to keep conversations light and not really discuss heavy things since she ""can't handle it"" or whatever.  For reference, I'm 26 and have to live with my parents because I became disabled and unable to support myself due to genetic conditions that are out of my control.  

Well, today, before my doctor's appointment, I was talking with her about media, first Star Trek and its actors and then Arrested Development.  She really likes Arrested Development, which is fine, I like it to an extent but it's also got a lot of stuff that makes me uncomfortable.  I mentioned to her that ""the show is like, 3/4 funny to me, I like the slapstick and some of the weird situations that would almost never happen in real life (stealing a house for example) but the jokes about disability and LGBT people aren't something that I, as a disabled trans woman, like.""  

Apparently, that was ""too critical"" and ""PC-culture is ruining everything where we can't even say R••••d any more about people who are R••••••d when it's just a medical term"" and how when I watch media I ""only look for negatives in it,"" and ""don't just enjoy the media for what it is, instead everything has to be negative.""  Coming from the person who is currently half-yelling at me over saying that 1/4 of a show made me uncomfortable but otherwise it was fine and it's just a product of its time.  

I pointed out how you can be critical of media while still enjoying it, and that doesn't make you a bad person, it's not a personal attack on you, and when even doctors don't use a term anymore, maybe there's a point where you should understand that it's offensive.  Apparently that too was a personal attack because she went on and on about how I ""think she's a bigot or a racist or a homophobe or whatever"" because she ""likes some media with offensive jokes.""  My E-dad came home around the same time I got back from my doctor's appointment, and I talked to him about it, and he was basically like, ""I don't know how else you could phrase it, sorry.""  

Like, it doesn't help that both of them tried to tell me for years I wasn't trans and are *only now* kind of accepting of it.  They call me the correct name and pronouns mostly, and have shown they're capable of change, but they're still anti-covid-vaccine anti-mask Trump supporters who view ""The left"" as the evil boogeymen who are coming to ""trans your children"" or whatever.  It's so frustrating that I can't **healthily** criticize media without it being a personal attack on my mom.  

Sometimes I wonder if my mom is even abusive or narcissistic, then this kind of thing happens where she puts all the blame on me and how I ""lied since I was a child.""

My younger sister is 18, and has just started school at an out of school university. I'll call her C, for this post. I stuck around for her, and now that she's going to be out of the house for the majority of the year for a while, I'm beginning to work on moving out. 

Scroll all the way down for the TL;DR. 

Throughout our lives, my mother has been rather controlling. I was never allowed to walk to places in town (even the public library, which is two blocks away) or attend sleepovers. Even now, she tracks my and my sister's phones. She always justifies it because she's anxious about our safety, and she was always our main caretaker. My father was around, but outside of driving us places he never did any actual raising. He also enables my mother in everything. 

C's move in day was a rush. My mom was scrambling to get forms signed before they left, which I assumed was standard college stuff. Then she starts talking about getting them notarized right away, just to come back frustrated because they needed an appointment and two witnesses. I heard the words ""power of attorney"" and then I started snooping. 

She bought a pdf pack of legal forms, which include a Health Care Directive (Proxy Directive) and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, a HIPAA Release Form and Durable Power of Attorney for Financial Decisions for C. I made copies of the forms when she was asleep, and then read over them. I even found the website she bought them from, which advertises this packet as ""what if your 18 year old out of state college student got into a car accident and you the parent couldn't access their medical records because they're legally an adult now"". 

The reason I'm absolutely certain she didn't read them, and didn't let C read through them or explain what any of the legalese meant, is because my mother didn't know they had to be notarized until the last minute. She's honestly been treating it like standard college forms. 

The first one- the Health Care Directive and Durable PoA for Health Care is fine. It's basically giving my mother rights to make health care decisions should C be incapacitated, and a directive about what actions to take if she was ever permanently in a vegetative state. The only concern I have about that is that it's a strange thing to make your adult child sign without explaining what it is. 

It's the HIPAA Release Form and the Durable PoA for Financial Decisions that's worrying me. HIPAA is basically healthcare privacy, and as far as I'm understanding, this document would apply indefinitely to every doctor in the US C will ever have. My mother would be able to access any and every medical record about anything (including reproductive health or therapy), whether C is 18 or 40. The language on the Durable PoA for Financial Decisions implies that it would apply from the moment the document came into effect, not just in the case C became incapacitated. It gives our mom control over all financial aspects- credit cards, loans, stocks and bonds, even mortgages. 

Given that my mother wanted C to sign all these forms last minute, I have no doubt C hasn't actually read any of them and assumed they were whatever my mother told her was true. 

This also might be a direct result of something I did. I'm transgender, and my mother wasn't supportive, so I started medical transition without her permission or knowledge. I think the legal forms for my sister are at least partly a result of that. I also went out of state for school, and my mom didn't try legal forms with me, just emotional pressure. 

Luckily, my mother can't get the forms signed the forms nor can they get notarized until C's in state again, which won't be until the end of this year, once her winter break starts. This gives me time. I'm a little afraid what my mom might do if C refuses. I also know that if C refuses, my mother will blame my interference, whether or not she has any proof of it. 

**TL;DR:** My mother tried to get my 18 year old sister (""C"") to sign off on Durable Power of Attorneys and a HIPAA release form, which would give my mother control over her finances and access to any of her medical records indefinitely, without explaining that said forms would do that. My mother was unable to get the forms signed, but I have no doubt she'll try again when C is back from school (C goes to college out of state) in a few months. My father enables my mother, and therefore is no help. 

I am definitely going to talk to C about this. It's her first time away from home and she's just beginning college, though, so I don't want to ruin it for her with something that isn't immediately urgent. 

I was also thinking of hiring a lawyer to read over the forms to make sure I'm understanding them right. However, I barely have enough money to pay off my student loans at the moment.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m having a hard time living with them and don’t know what to do. Hopefully anyone here can provide some insight on how to deal with this. 

Over the past year, I’ve seen a side of my parents that I never knew existed. I’m not sure what triggered it but I can’t deal with them anymore. Basically, all they want to do is compete with me. Here are some examples: 

- I got this big internship this spring after months of applications. Throughout the whole course of it, my parents were treating me like shit. They’d brag about their own jobs to me and walk away when I talked about mine. 

- After my internship was done, I updated my resume on LinkedIn with my accomplishments. I checked my Dad’s profile a week after and he essentially copied everything that I wrote and put them as “his strengths” (I know for a fact he hasn’t done any of the work I did). 

- They are constantly trying to lead me in the wrong direction. My Dad always recommends these shitty career paths that I know for a fact won’t get me anywhere. He only says this so I don’t surpass him. 

- They get happy when I mess up. I’ve noticed this on many occasions and they will continue to bring up my mistakes. 

These are just a few examples. The worst part about this is that I have done everything they could ask for as a son. I’m a good student, I don’t get into trouble, and I’m working towards my career goals. I take care of my family and I find it pathetic that I have to deal with immature parents. 

So far, I have tried to be the bigger person. I let these things go and continue on with being the best son I can. It’s now gotten to the point where I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the financials to leave the house but can’t keep this going. I’ve tried talking with them but they always walk away.

for context: my mother is bipolar (idk what type because both of my parents are very hush hush about her condition) and my father is a functioning alcoholic (4-6 beers a night to sleep, and beer all day on the days off)



i am back home from college (only for 5 days) for the first time in a while as a concession to my mother - the pandemic has given me a window (as i’m sure it has to many others) to finally take a break and figure out how to get on track


after doing my absolute best to avoid coming home for the past 2 years now, i have recently become a healthy weight on the BMI scale and next tuesday i will be evaluated for ADHD - i am blessed to have roommates who want to see me stop drinking 4-6 cups of coffee a day to function and that will pay for this by way of their parents’ charity 

i have had quite a bit of time to think, and therapy is the logical next step, but i can’t really put my emotions on hold until then


i recently told one of my roommates that i am contemplating going no contact with my parents - he advised against it, but i feel that maybe i should not shy away from the gravity of the situation the next time i discuss it with him. i thanked him for bringing me back down to reality, but after coming back to my childhood home, i can only help but think that the “reality” i was brought down to was the one away from home.

one of the first things my mother tells me when i get back home was that my ADHD evaluation will be a waste of money (mind you, i have already been to an on campus counselor who assessed me and told me i had a high likelihood of ADHD). every time i bring this subject up, her only reasoning that i don’t have ADHD is “i am your mother”, as if M.D was placed in front of her name when she gave birth to me. in june, when i told her about my decision to get tested, i was able to (temporarily) get through to her that there is a high likelihood that i have ADHD. her immediate concern was not how i felt, but how she would be perceived by my roommates’ parents and if they’d think she’s a bad mother.

not much else has happened, but i haven’t really had a moment of peace in this house because i am just anticipating her to blow up and my anger has just been stirring in my head. my siblings are also exceedingly fed up with my parents, and im about to set up my sister’s FAFSA and jumpstart her college application process so she can get out of this house and see that our parents have failed. i understand that they have been set up for failure, but they continue to fail.


i am waiting for my mother to explode and call us pigs, animals, or retarded, completely oblivious to the fact that we are products of her parenting

my father isn’t here, but if he was, he’d be so drunk that i’d have to take care of him, else he’d be a danger to society

Their relationship started as an affair and they both abandoned their spouses and children to start their life together. For additional context, my mom sat my dad and me down at the same time (I was still in HS) and told us she was leaving and literally drove away. I was left to help support my dad, who quickly became a severe depressive alcoholic. 

Over the years, I have kept a decent relationship with my mom and stepdad, recognizing that marriages are difficult and my parents never had a perfect life, so I always tried not to blame her or create tension. I visit them on holidays and vacations and we’ve always had a fairly pleasant relationship. 

For the past few years, my mom has been having increasingly serious issues with my stepdad, and she has no hesitation calling me in the middle of drunk arguments or unloading on me, calling me in tears to get my advice or opinion on issues between them. I have tried to draw some boundaries in our relationship, including doing some emotional withdrawing and talking about my own concerns with mental health experts, which has helped me. My mom will pretend that negative or emotionally charged conversations between us simply didn’t happen, and expect me to pretend that everything is fine and normal immediately afterwards. 

My mom and stepdad have a trip to visit me planned for two weeks from now. (I live across the country from them) Today, she once again called me in tears and unloaded on me about their financial issues, which include him having to pay child support for the two kids he abandoned, to the point where my mom (who is approaching retirement), has no savings or nothing to fall back on. My mom has cut everyone else out of her life because they didn’t respect her decision to abandon her family, and has always put so much pressure on me as “all she has left.”

Currently, according to her, she is not on speaking terms with my stepdad. They are cohabitating but not speaking, and he has made it clear that he has no plan to support her when she’s supposed to retire. They already bought tickets and a hotel to come visit in a couple weeks, even though the latest financial concern meant that he had to unload their entire savings to his ex wife or risk going to jail. 

Today, my mom told me that she expects him to “behave” on the trip, and that she told him that he’s “lucky” they already bought tickets or it wouldn’t be happening. She also casually said to me “oh, maybe you can talk some sense into him.” 

I am in a position where I think I need to say that I’m not comfortable with the trip happening given everything that’s going on, especially because the expectation is that I would just play nice and pretend like there’s nothing happening. I have considered saying that she can visit on her own, or they can just cancel it outright. 

My fear is that they have previously gotten into drunk arguments that have escalated to physical violence, and they have lots of liquor and guns in their home (they live in the middle of nowhere in a very rural area). Anything I do to react to what I’m hearing right now would likely promote an escalation between them, and I don’t trust either of them not to get violent. Of course, I know that such a response is in no way my fault or responsibility.

A friend of my mother was reported for raping a woman he had met on a dating app some months ago. However, he wasn't convicted due to ""lack of evidence.""

Of course, he goes around saying that *""that woman is crazy""* and that it was a *""fake report.""*

Both my mother and my sister believe him because *""that woman reported several men in addition to him, how could so many men rape her on the same day?""*, *“Why didn't she report him the same day he supposedly raped her? It's too suspicious.”* and also *“Same thing happened to Johnny Depp, and he's innocent.”*

Well, some friends of my mother were planning to meet that man and she wanted to go with them, she told me.

And I wanted to scream.

I don't know that woman, but I know what kind of men tell those stories about ""crazy"" or ""evil"" women and ""fake reports.""

I know this because I see how they get away with it on the news every day.

I know this because patriarchy and male privilege exist.

I know this because my father was an abuser who used to say that and my mother went through exactly the same thing and no one believed her either, so I don't understand why she sides with that guy now.

So I told her that I don't believe him.

And everything went horribly wrong.

She was furious at me. We argued for hours. My head hurts right now, but she basically yelled at me that I'm a bigot and that I have no right to tell her who she can be friends with before slamming the door of her bedroom.

Then came the silence.

Neither she nor my sister spoke to me for a week. They just stared at me coldly and ignored me while acting to each other like nothing was wrong.

The following week she started talking to me again, but it's weird because I don't feel like she's affectionate. I don't know how to explain it. She randomly approaches me and I feel like she's trying to get me to react and kiss her, but she doesn't make any mention of what happened the week before, and when I don't give in, as I still feel uncomfortable, she gets mad at me and asks me if I “don't care about her anymore,"" and then I feel guilty for not giving in, but I feel that she is a stranger to me.

The tension keeps rising with each passing day. Today she told me that she wants me to wash my clothes separately (we always put our clothes together in the washing machine).

I'm afraid that she is going to try to kick me out soon and I have no job (I still have at least two years left to finish what I am currently studying) or friends or family that I can trust.

I'm afraid that she might bring that guy home because history is repeating itself and she is reverting to her old self from when we lived with an abuser.

I'm scared because I don't get what's going on and it's been two weeks and I don't know what's going to happen next.

My last post explains the situation in depth. My brother is 16 btw. My little brothers friend told me last year that my brother confided in him and told him that my mom would walk in on my brother in the shower and “kind of look” was the words he used. He said that my mom would “look at his parts.” And he also said my mom made a comment to him and said “I see your ass!” While he was in the shower. If this isint weird enough …. Now that I know what I know (refer back to last post ) I remember several months ago a couple comments she made that just seemed well… off to me. It was a random comment and made no sense. The first thing she told me was “it seems like a lot of men are gay. I just hope they’re not doing anything to your brother. “ she said this out of nowhere when we were in the car on the way to lunch once.  another time she brought up how I would sneak my ex in the house at night when I was 15 and she said “I just hope he didn’t go in your brothers room and touch him or hurt him.” She has no reason to think this.

It matters not if I show care for her, worry about her health, listen to her stories from work. In her eyes, I don't have a job. And that means, I am an unproductive leech that doesn't offer anything in the house. 


On top of that, she of course dislikes how I block her whenever she feels like getting angry and using my sister as her mental outlet. You know, like normal people do, instead of having a hobby or therapy to deal with their emotions. Her problems are always above everyone else's, no one understands her, and we have it easy. Since she brings the money, it gives her all the rights according to her words.

Today she repeatedly told me how I should ""pack up"" after yesterday's fight, since I ""don't love her""  and don't respect her rule. ""My house my rules"" is her constant say. I said that it's the nature of the supposed rules that make her a dictator, rather than a parent.
She tried to equate my constant use of the computer, to a supposed ""complete failure of a social life"", despite me being the happiest I've ever been with the people I got.  And  how I'm burning too much money by staying at home. Nothing else matters, apart from money and ""how much you're burning/eating/consuming, and how much you're bringing"". 
Meanwhile, half the time I eat food that I bought myself , and despite being in a 40c degree country in the middle of the summer, I use no air-conditioning. All I use, is my computer and a lightbulb

And if that's not the reason, then it's because we aren't healthy kids that live up to her ideal standards. And if that's not it either, then it's because we don't respect or understand her enough. There's always something, some reason to nitpick, to unleash fury, to tear into the people around her and to find fault in every speck of their being. 

One day she will be loving, humorous, and empathetic. Then one thing goes astray in her life, and everyone pays the price.

I am ready to stand my ground. I know my rights. I am here to protect my sister, and I'm not leaving unless the court and the police itself decide that I must. And I have nearly an entire family that will back my words and my experiences up.

i've listened to them scream at him many, many times. sometimes they even threaten to hit him (don't think they ever actually have, but still) all because he was being ""disrespectful"". 

once when we were at his 16th birthday party, he asked his mom if all of us (there were abt 8 of us, all within the range of 15-19 yrs old) could walk down to the twistee treat (a local ice cream chain) down the road for some ice cream. she said no. he asked why, seeing as we were in a big group, (\*mostly boys too, there was only one girl and it was his gf at the time) it was like 2pm and not at all dark out, and we had someone over 18 with us. she snapped and yelled at him, saying that she's the adult and she has all the power and he shouldn't question her authority and should just do what she says. i heard her in the other room a few minutes later talking to the other parents about how much she wanted to hit him for ""talking back."" 

\*- i mentioned that our group was made up of almost all boys because his mom has kinda old fashioned ideas on gender, and even chewed us out later bc she read our group chats and got offended that we dared to swear with girls present. i wouldn't put it past her to think that it's too dangerous for girls to ever go out on their own.

i remember they didn't used to be like this, but as he's gotten older they've turned their grip on him into a stranglehold. they control almost everything he does in his life, and i've listened to him talk many times about how much he can't wait to turn 18 and be able to get away from them. and they remind me of my stepmother so much that i get really anxious at the idea of having to be around them, and can't enjoy going to his house anymore because they have cameras set up everywhere so they can see what we're doing even when they're not physically there.

changed who I was to appease my parents. I became an extreme people pleasing carpet to others. I felt very damaged by what they said to me. 

And I'm confused about whether or not I can count myself as a victim of abuse.

As an Asian person, I've understood that loyalty to parents is an absolute. In that culture, I think being beaten down to become submissive is common and expected. Theres a lot of Asian parenting, family politics, and societal rules that I feel are very wrong.

But I dont know any asian person that sees it that way. Its a common joke among American people that asian parents will beat their children if they have bad grades. Asian abuse is a literal joke.

In fact, I was like everyone else not too long ago. I thought I had a normal upbringing and that my parents were actually on the lighter side.

I dont know any asian person that would say ""my parents were abusive and want nothing to do with them"". I'm specifically talking about parents that are verbally and mentally abusive. I'm neglecting society's idea that is only on physical abuse.

Its expected that the father provides for the family. And he has. Ultimately, we will always say that we are grateful to them. And I think that this sense of gratefulness has invalidated any feelings we had that they wronged us.

Anyway, I feel lost again. In asian society I would definitely be cursed to death. Theres no greater sin then not respecting your parents. My dad always said if we were back in our home country that he would beat me. 

In both cultures, US and an asian one I have no place. A person like me is filfth. To them I must have a deluded mind. 

I want to know more about the upbringing of other asians too. I only have a small sample size to work with. I dont know what the typical upbringing is supposed to be like. I got what was considered light and good (no physical abuse).

I'm pretty sure slapping is a normalized practice as well. I doubt many people would count it as abusive even though I think hitting someone is never okay.


Edit: Thank you everyone for coming to tell me your stories and encouraging words. I'm really thankful to just know that I'm not alone. Im worried a lot sometimes that everything is all in my head. I cry and put my head down when my ndad hugs me and I feel so much guilt in my heart.

Today was a really bad one. It was like he pulled out a list and was just going down it. My friends, my art, stuff that I like. I try to keep my interests as close to the vest as possible, but he's still able to draw on some things for ammunition. What a terrible thing to do, using those kinds of things as a weapon.

Now I am very worried - that what if she gives trouble again for both of us after marriage -- how can I avoid that or how can I be aware of that-- I am already 1000 miles away from her -- but still she is my nightmare -- I seriously pray that no one should have a mother like her-- I don't her to be with me during my pregnancy or post-pregnancy or any time of my life - -- due to societal pressure I am still entertaining her -- which I regret so many times -- how to survive ? :) please do suggest /help",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713896,public,self,A mother that no one needs:,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p8e1a8/a_mother_that_no_one_needs/,some_ads,7,,,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

My mom would work, cook, clean, and give me attention while my dad simply babysat me and when my mom would come he'd be bolting out the door to sell and smoke weed with his friends. He'd yell at me for the dumbest of reasons, making me cry everytime. Eventually he started spoiling me with McDonald's and crappy PS2 games just to be the ""cool dad"". My mom and dad had been separated of 7 years now, since I was 10. Ever since that she's been dating men that all fit the same criteria: middle age, unattractive and redneck. Safe to say she had her heart broken multiple times. The second last time this ugly troglodyte of a man abused our dogs with a shock collar. A few times she would ask me, a 12 year old kid who was very naive, if they (mom and troglodyte) should stay together. One time I said no and after that she said they made a ""pact"". Then I was sexually assaulted via dry humping and stole over $5,000 with a fake Bitcoin scheme. After that, we kept having this guy over and she did this ""sneaking out"" scheme where he would be left without anyone. I was visiting my real dad and told him about the situation. 

He called my mom and threatened to call the cops. she swore to herself and me that she wouldn't date anyone on focus on being a parent. Not even a month later, while she was supporting a local DJ that was friends with her, she met her current boyfriend. Get this - she made the first move. After that they became friends and started dating a week later. I was indifferent. I kept to myself and stayed in my room all the time. But then I met him. At first he was pretty nice to me, but because of the past I didn't hesitate to not trust this guy. At first I found him to be creepy he had a rather obsessive liking for trains, with a couple of religious memorabilia and a clock with a Japanese school bell in his house. At the time i had an interest in electronics (Arduino, R Pi and the like) so he gave me his old breadboard kit and I lost interest almost immediately. At first he said I was an ""alright guy"" and then it spiraled into me being disrespectful. This, combined with my extreme right wing political parroting at school (I'm center left now) made me a rather bratty kid. It eventually led to him telling me that he's going to beat the shit out of me, hospitalize me, etc. A good example when he was 3 ft apart from me and made punching moves toward my face. This man was 49. Another example was when we were going out camping, he had tapped me on my ass, saying ""good job"" for something I did. I freaked out, asking him if he were gay (I was closeted at the time) he had gotten very confrontational, threatened to beat me up and put his hands on me and pushed me. I went back into the camper and he started comparing himself to the ""old fuck on the farm"" and he ""wouldn't take shit from nobody"". Instead of trying to correct any hatred between us, my mom decided to add fuel to the fire by having us move in with him not even a year later. It was awful. Cops were being called by me every week because I felt like my life was in danger, with good reason. But every. single. time, the chief of police would tell me over the phone, ""Shut the fuck up, do what your parents are telling you, and stop calling us."" The same chief had threatened to punch me in the face, and even shoot me. I had my crotch grabbed, I had been told by him his penis size, I had been told that if I were a girl it'd be neat to want to masturbate, all while he's telling me I'm a pedophile for being gay, and would show me ""evidence"" that the LGBT is full of pedophiles. I had been told by him that, because of my poor handwriting, I should've been held back to the third grade.

A month ago, I had been confronted for using a shower without their permission.

Stepdad: what the fuck?

Me: what?

Stepdad: what do you mean ""what""?

We started arguing and he would use personal attacks against me, such as me being a ""menace to society"" and that ""he can't wait for me to move out at 17"" and ""you're lucky I have self control so I can't beat your fucking ass"". The final straw was when he had come up to my face 2 feet close, puckered and blew a kiss. I said ""that's really funny"" ""YEAAHHHH."" Replied Dave. 

I tell you what, I fucking SNAPPED. I punched him in his stupid, ugly, fucking face. And then we finally fought. And I'll tell you what, it was a full on BRAWL.  eventually I got arrested for assault and now have a court case. After all the years of me being made fun of, being mistreated by authority figures, and this is the result. Are you happy now? You decided to put me on trial and potentially put me in a horrible place with 24/7 surveillance, violent inmates and possible human rights violations.

I’ve sat back just staring at the window. And while I was doing that leaned back it finally occurred to me I had done that before. I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I feel lifeless.

Some back story, I was raised by a narc ex stepfather, and my narc mother. My parents divorced when I was about 5-6. I feel I’ve never been happy in my life due to that divorce. My grandparents said I took it the hardest. I’m just discovering my dads narcissistic side. He didn’t say anything this week or do anything to me. I just don’t know why I’m this way.

I really didn’t wanna go right now thanks to COVID, but my Ndad insisted so we had to. Originally my dad wanted to take only me as it was my graduation since he made an agreement with us that if we got a 3.8 or higher, he’d take us anywhere we want in the world. I graduated with a 4.3 and chose Italy. Since the prices were lower, he asked if I wanted to take the family. Since this was a big deal and I really really reaaaally wanted to enjoy it with my parents, I (stupidly) said yes. 

Big mistake. My sister hates art and history. My Nmom hates everything and wanted to go to Florence because she wanted to see the Medici stuff since she’s been obsessed with the show. My dad is just a smartass who believes only he is the most cultured and only person who knows everything and anything. 

My family just has been so rude and unbelievably cruel, as they can’t stop calling me ugly or fat or whatever insult they come up with. Now, I am allergic to the sun (I know, I know, ‘why go to ITALY IN THE SUMMER’) and am very sensitive to it. I try to wear tons of sunscreen and carry my umbrella wherever I go to minimize sun exposure. My dad, after so many years, still does not believe I have it and insists I am too ugly and pale and need to stop. He literally hid my sunscreen and punished me for trying to get it! 

My dad refused to take me to any art museums, citing, ‘no one likes them except you’ so we did nothing I wanted. He took over, caused fights with everyone and was just so rude. 

He’s so self absorbed and absolutely stupid, he got mad we wore masks because to him “it was disrespecting him because we were saying he smelled bad and didn’t care what he had to say”. He got mad at me when he asked multiple questions about various topics and paintings, and I tried to explain but he cut me off and said I knew nothing and I should stop trying to be a teacher (which sucks cuz I am working on becoming a high school teacher).

I’ve phrased the title as a question, because this is something I am wrestling with and whilst I’ve signed up for therapy and I’m waiting for an appointment, I just wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar.

When I was around 8 years old, I was playing on the PC in the living room (I don’t remember the time but I know that I didn’t really have an enforced bed time by this age) and my mother put on one of her favourite movies - The Accused starring Jodie Foster. I’m not going to go into the details here, but there is a very graphic scene involving the main character being sexually assaulted. 

I vividly remember being frozen to the spot, asking my mother to please turn it off as the scene was upsetting me and my mother telling me that if I didn’t like it I could “go to my room” and I should have but I felt rooted to my chair. That night I went to bed and the scene just played over and over in my head. My mother offered no context or explanation of what had happened in the scene or made any attempt to soothe me.

This happened a few more times over the years, different movies but similar scenes and I reacted the same, rooted in the chair in fear but unable to look away. My mother never turned off the scenes or talked to me about them afterward.

Even to this day, if The Accused is mentioned my mother raves about it being one of her favourite movies and I am left feeling sick.

I’m now an adult, however I find these scenes to be triggering - much more than discomfort though. If I come across a scene in a movie or tv show I will obsess about it for days and have the urge to read more about it or even rewatch it even though I know it will distress me even more. I will keep playing the scene in my head over and over, not on purpose but it won’t go away.

I have to google movie plots and parent guides before I’ll even sit with my partner to watch something, and it’s exhausting.

I guess my question is has anyone else been through something similar and do you have any coping strategies? I’m searching it up on the internet but not finding much.

He is a good man and we generally have a good relationship, however recent events have opened my eyes to a pattern of behavior that doesn't seem healthy for a father-daughter relationship.

My parents divorced when I was 3. My mother remained single, but my father married a woman when I was 6 and later they had my baby sister. They eventually split up after 7 or 8 years but throughout their relationship, he would complain to me about women and taught me not to be ""one of those women"". He was very sexist and I eventually started calling him out on it as I got older(I am the eldest of his 3 daughters), he's changed his view on women but it took a lot of talking/arguments, and he's still nowhere near being considered a feminist. 

He has a different relationship with each of his children and the dynamics are constantly changing. I know parents aren't supposed to have favorites but I always felt that out of the 4 of us I was his favorite(this changed recently). He would always tell me he expected the most from me out of all of my siblings, and that he's scared my siblings will leave him when he's old but not me. He spent countless hours lecturing me on how to be a good person and telling me what kind of woman he wants me to be. I don't think this was conscious of him, but I feel like he was molding me into the type of woman \*he\* wanted to be with. As I got older he confided in me more and more using me as a free therapist. This stopped after I eventually snapped and told him to stop treating me like one. 

My father is a very generous and caring man he would give someone the shirt off his back if they needed it, but what he gives each of his kids is very different. He gives my brother(the eldest) technology and pretty much anything he sees as practical. He gives my sisters(the babies) anything they want they're not very materialistic though so it's mostly crafts supplies. He gives me grown things, we were all living in a 2 bedroom apt so he bought a house and said it was for me. I was getting bruises all over my back from my bed so he bought the whole family new beds/mattresses and said he did it because of me. Don't get me wrong I'm very grateful for my father's generosity but those are \*huge\* financial burdens and that puts a lot of pressure on me. He's always put a lot of pressure on me so I don't think he even realizes it.

Our relationship took one of its biggest hits after I started dating my ex-girlfriend. To be fair she was an awful human who manipulated and gaslit me constantly, but she did point out a few weird things about my relationship with my family. She told me once(and this could have been a lie) that my father told her mother that because he didn't have a wife I would have to step up and take on the role of the woman of the house. They were constantly at ends, telling me to do two conflicting things and both expecting me to listen to them blindly. They both expected me to cut off the other. I was obedient and young so trying to please them both ended with me ruining my relationships with both of them. 

The thing that finally tore our relationship apart was when I moved in with my boyfriend last winter. We rarely talk now. He never says ""I love you"" anymore. It hurts and idk why he's treating me like such a disappointment.

Here is the problem though, because me entire life was focussed on providing a better life for my mother and getting her away from my father, I never spent time cultivating friendships. I focussed exclusively on work. Now I have a stable-ish job (no job is truly secure) and that's it. I literally don't have any friends or any family.

I was always a good kid growing up. Never got into trouble, didn't party and always avoided drama. She's done it all. Gone through my phone (to read messages and get my friends phone numbers to keep tabs), listened to my calls on the houseline, followed me around in the car (to this day I'm constantly terrified she's watching me from somewhere in the distance and I'll see that gray Toyota Sienna), interrogated my friends behind my back (even threatened my girlfriend when I was 19 to not see me anymore behind my back which was devastating), keeps tabs on me by checking public records for any tickets or recent arrests despite me not being a felon or ever being charged with a misdemeanor, keeping tabs on credit card purchases, an adult friend of mine once wouldn't even come over when my parents were out of town because she was convinced my mom had hidden cameras in the house etc. Needless to say, she has no shame in stalking my every move if she even remotely suspects I'm partying. Here's the thing though...this was back when I was in my early 20's working 60-80 hrs per week trying to become independent and just have fun with friends when I had down time. Growing up she was the exact same way except she was EXTREMELY religious (Christian). I'm a Atheist so yeah, that was insane. She grew up in an extremely religious and dysfunctional household with an abusive Valium addicted mother who did the exact same crazy stuff my mom does. My mom vowed to NEVER end up like her, but she has. I got kicked out for two years at the beginning of 2018 when my substance abuse continued, only I had recently been diagnosed as Bipolar. I also have Asperger's and have always been told I'm extremely intelligent and talented (I play guitar and specialize in heavy metal which is what I aspire to do), but I've always been extremely insecure and depressed. I've always struggled making friends because of my awkwardness, but despite my kindness I always get stabbed in the back or abandoned by my closest friends sooner or later that I've only ever been there for. When I got kicked out every single one of my ""friends"" immediately ghosted me, but only after making me out to be a piece of crap which seems to be the go to way of handling people these days among most. When I was homeless it was nothing more than the ""tough love"" approach when I know it was just a selfish attempt to control me again. She only wanted me to get clean so she'd stop worrying about me all the time, but she convinces herself it's always with good intentions and not narcissistic ones. I went through a cycle of living on the streets all strung out on Vodka, Crack and hardcore Opiates, Psych Wards, in patient rehab for 3 months, Sober Living Facility where I'd get kicked out after several months because of a bad relapse then repeat the cycle. After a two week bender on the cold streets I decided abruptly on the night of May 19th 2020 I was done, and oddly my parents let me move back in the next day which was weird because they were so stubborn about it. Been off the hard stuff ever since and I don't do any of that mainstream recovery crap that doesn't seem to help anybody in the long run anyway for the most part (you see a lot of the same faces going in and out of those types of facilities). If you just believe in yourself you can do anything. I hate that mainstream recovery programs push religious 12 step mumbo jumbo and codependency. Anyway moving on, she is literally like a mad scientist when it comes to my medication, Bipolar, addictions etc. No matter what improvements I make she'll always find a way to make it out like I need more professional help. As she's getting older (mid 50's) she's becoming more and more stubborn and unwilling to back off. Before she'd actually listen and attempt to make a change in her behavior. Now she just seems to not care at all. All she ever talks to me about now is Bipolar, mania, addictions, Psychologists, doctors, support groups, peer support, working with a job agency (even though I already make my own independent money just fine), and whenever I casually mention going on a trip, seeing a friend or trying out a dating app she makes the same dumb, predictable, anxious grimace that immediately reveals she's thinking the worst (relapse). I've explicitly said to NEVER talk about Psychologists (I hate them because they've only ever made things worse) or my personal life, yet she does on a daily basis. Once I finally can't take it and I assertively say ""No more, I'm done"" and walk away, she talks AT me like I'm a spoiled child. I finally realize that she has always viewed me as a helpless little boy that needs assistance in everything he does. She holds my past mistakes against me, and feels 100% in her right to violate my privacy and business even if it means stalking me. She'll occasionally take into account what I say when I finally lash out because she's not getting the hint, but she ALWAYS goes right back to her old ways within a week or two after trying to be more aware of her behavior. I in general am realizing now that I'm clean just how narcissistic she really is. She constantly seeks the approval of others and when she doesn't get it she gets offended, she is obsessed with my well being to the point that her well being relies on my well being, she can't take negative criticism of any kind even if it comes from a number of people but complains all day about people being to sensitive these days. She talks AT me, not to me, and she forces advice at me even when I don't want it, but if I come flat out and say I got it or no I don't want help she gets agitated at me (oh yeah, she's the most passive aggressive person I've ever seen). This is literally not even the tip of the iceberg. I know I'll move out one day, but I'm just grateful to be in this big luxurious house where I have the entire finished basement level all to myself so I never have to see her upstairs. The reason I'm still here honestly is because once I move I want it to be permanent, I have no idea where I want that to be yet. The big reason though is that I'm still recovering from the psychological distress of being homeless for two years and everything that happened before and during all that sadness. Sleeping on wet, stinky concrete behind the dumpsters in the cold night rain next to the vacant 7eleven gas station I managed years back while chugging vodka and shooting Heroin because my girlfriend and best friend both died less than 18 months apart is pretty horrible. There's nothing like feeling everybody you ever loved hates you and has only proven their selfishness by not even giving you a couch to sleep on for the night or to call every few days to see if you're okay. Nothing. I would've done anything I could to help a friend who was in my shoes. Why are people like this? Why is my mom like this? I feel like everything everybody tells me is just a lie. Even the doctors. I was taking several different meds none of which worked. I abruptly quit both the anti psychotic and anti depressant 8 months ago and now just take my mood stabilizer once per day and smoke a bunch of Pot. Haven't been manic since and it's awesome, yet my mom is convinced that I'm constantly having some type of episode just because I might be tired or slightly agitated. I'm the last person to play the victim card because I pride myself on my resilience, but it really does suck having seething resentment towards your mother when they've done so much good things for you, but the bad stuff they do is so far beyond acceptable that these mixed emotions pop up.

Yet... he never protected me... he never offered me guidance. He let her do what she wanted with me, and still does, and would never ever side with me against her, because he fears her too much and is under her commands...

My mother will go from loving me to telling me to off myself and that I ruined her life. Just the other day she said she is gonna off herself if i don't stop talking back. I live with my molester grandfather.

She also broke my brother's phone and rationalized it by saying it was already broken and that it was causing bad luck and that she did a good job, etc. She said I am no better than a drug addict and that I am an evil person for self harming because no good person would mutitate themselves (even though this woman has tried to off herself in the past). She said I keep provoking her by talking back. My therapist said she is just hurt and surpised that i started talking back after years of just putting up with her abuse.

I asked her why she lets her anger take over her. She says its because the vaccine made her scared and that she hasn't been acting rationally. That I talk back too much and that i ruined her life.

My dad left me with said molester and told me to just get over the sexual abuse and move on with life. I started talking with some guy online and being intimate but he hasn't been talking to me all day. I'm just so alone.

I was raised by my grandmother who passed away from a stroke last year, because my mother was always out drinking, partying, and was abusive at best when she was home. When I was 10, my mother had her first bout of health issues, primarily several large kidney stones requiring 5 surgeries, and a nephrostomy tube coming out of her back for almost a year that I was forced to do wound care on, even at such a young age. Since then she has had 2 more smaller kidney stones, 4 TIAs (mini strokes), 2 blood clots (one in her leg, one which traveled to her lung), and was committed to a mental health facility for 3 months.



My grandma supported her until she was 53, before finally throwing her out after the cops came for her with a warrant for theft and tax evasion. With no priors she got 30 days suspended and had to pay back the money. No other consequences. As an adult, I see her for about an hour every 2 weeks to take her to get a bus pass and pay her bills. She doesn't drive, lives in an income based 55 and older apartment, and works 20 hrs a week.  I try to avoid her as much as I can, but I know my grandma wouldn't want us to completely go NC. 



The issue is, despite her health problems, she will make no lifestyle changes, and is 5'1 with a bmi of 45+ minimum all of her life. Fast food several times a week, soda everyday, etc. This wouldn't normally bother me, however my state has filial law, meaning if something should happen to her, I am automatically on the hook for her care/final expenses. I know most people don't mind helping their parents as they age, but I am little more than an acquaintance to this woman, and have quite literally been through enough hell in my life because of her. The thought of going bankrupt, fined, or even jailed because I don't have the means to pay her way makes me sick. 



Earlier today she called and asked to see me. As soon as I pulled up I could see her limping and the facial drooping. I begged to take her to the hospital, which she refused, and told me to go get Taco Bell for her. A huge fight ensued, and I finally gave up and drove away after she said that I wasn't her boss, and that I could either do as I was told, or she would just quit her job and I would be forced to take care of her, threatening to get adult protective services/police/lawyers involved. 



I am terrified that she will make good on her threat, or have a full blow stoke and pass away/become incapacitated leaving me on the hook.  Any advice, kind words, or resources from other who have been in this kind of situation would be amazing.

I had a cousin I was pretty close to. She (C) was married to my asshole cousin, so we aren't related, just by marriage, but her husband (B) is a reprobate bastard and really always has been. He almost died of liver failure a year or so ago, but somehow managed to get on a transplant list despite being a heavy drinker and tipping the scales at close to 500lbs while refusing to listen to doctors for years about his health problems, including gout and pre-diabetes. Anyway, he's a horrible person and extremely verbally abusive to anyone and everyone in the vicinity, so his near-death experience didn't affect me much at all except the horror of seeing the state of him in the hospital. He was literally yellow. He's recovered now. My cousin, (C), has always been lovely, if not occasionally overly talkative, and she was a refugee from Cambodia who escaped the Cambodian Genocide and was more or less trapped in this marriage.

She's neurotic, and overly sweet most of the time. However, the more time I spend with her I'm realizing some kind of twisted things about her.

She is extremely self-sacrificial, but I'm realizing that she secretly is resentful if you don't foresee her needs and basically force her to not be self sacrificial. For example, she won't eat unless my partner demands that she does (weird because he is her child, and they are both adults). From what I hear, when he was very young he took on the role of caretaker with her when she was depressed and their was a lot of emotional incest as his father is an overt grandiose narcissist. 

She also talks a LOT of shit. About her children, their partners, really anyone and everyone. It makes me very uncomfortable because I know I'm not ""spared"" from this treatment. She often positions herself as a victim in situations without much interrogation. 

Sometimes I also sense that if my partner and I are being  affectionate with each other she feels uncomfortable and possibly even a little jealous. Which maybe this is normal but, still not sure. I can tell that she has a fear of abandonment with her kids because they are her whole life, and feels threatened by in-laws for this reason.  Again, lots of conflation with codependent vs narcissist. 

It impacts my relationship with my partner because he acts more narcissistically around his family. He will snap at his mom sometimes which makes me uncomfortable because she's always SO sweet to him, to the extreme like my-son-can-do-no-harm. 

As I spend more time with them it makes me turned off to my boyfriend because she puts him on such a pedestal and I see him eat it up. It's just weird and gross and I'm not sure what to do. I don't typically feel this way when it's just him and I, but maybe it's easier to overlook things between us.

I hit some kind of rock bottom lately. Something I worked really hard for made it possible for me to really relax for the first time in my life. I have never been outside of survival mode and as wonderful as it is, I am becoming more and more aware of how much of a sprint, fight and mostly nightmare my life has been until now.

I am looking into therapy options at the moment and (I guess) taking quite good care for myself.

Even if I am NC with my biological parents, I am still and have always been in contact with my slightly older brother. I can not exactly explain the bond we do have tbh. We had a hate-love-relationship as kids (thanks bParents!), but got quite close when he had cancer. He was 17. We got to be a team to (silently) support each other and live through all this together. After that the connection got loose as I left the house as soon as I turned 18. I needed space. Also had lots of feelings of regret leaving him alone.
We still saw each other from time to time. Mostly on birthdays etc. Since the pandemic we are seeing each other only as the team of siblings which is so cool. We even had some deeper conversations, but I get the feeling this is extremely hard for him as his circle of friends is more the type of party friends. As I got used to trusting people, opening up and talking about feelings with new friends I found. He does not feel comfortable talking about his feelings, but is able to open up a bit when he is talking to me. Otherwise he has a few topics he is just really into and loves talking about that non-stop, which is very exhausting for me. At the same time I love people beeing geeks and learning weird stuff.

I am starting to think about trying to talk about our childhood with him. He is the only one who experienced the same reality as I did, maybe in a totally different way. Yet I can not even imagine his position as he still lives in that house (due to lots of reasons). Could be healthy for both of us or really bad talking about it.

Not sure how to approach it to be honest. I'd love to at least tell him about me going into therapy this year, but I do not know how to approach that kind of conversation.

Some ref about me- 20(M), Indian. I've always tried so so hard to not to hate my parents. In a relationship there are good things and bad things. It's not like we do not have happy family moments, we do. But we(me) also have some bad moments like fight between me and my mother(not physical), arguments. This is normal. I don't hate my parents, I've been past that (I'll cover this point in some later post). I only focus on those happy moments, and HUGELY ignore those bad moments. Because I don't want to end up like people whom I've seen on this sub, explaining their difficulties. I just don't. I see they are in so much worse situations than mine, and I must avoid that dark part of the life. I don't know if you're understanding me or not, but that's it.

Now I'm not here to criticize my parents. I care about my parents a lot, I don't want to hate them. But I'm here to discuss what happened to me. I had an argument with my mother and I stayed quiet, just sayings some logical things, to prove that she's the one who always starts fights-I've been doing this for some few months now, to prove her I'm not the one who fights with her, rather she instead, because she always says I'm the one, and she still don't realise this- so I stayed quiet and sat on the sofa and waited for her to go for pray which would take atleast an hour (we Indians have a small room in the house for praying) I was so tensed and irritated due to some argument, I was just staring blankly at the window.

I just put my left palm on my cheek to partially tilt-cup my face and as soon as I touched me face, I didn't believe it was my hand, I thought someone else was comforting me. So I touched a bit more and I loved it, as some orphan child would when being adopted, sad but feeling love. But as I just put my right palm and touched my face, I bursted into tears, as some sad person would cry when comfort by his loved one, so I touched more and more and cried a lot. When the cool part of my soft palm(my mother says I've very soft hands because I don't do any household or any work)So, when the cool part of my soft palm touched my lips, I felt so good. So I just kept touching and rubbing my palm, wiping my tears.

 I know all of you would be thinking I'm a psycho guy who is feeling his own touch, eww wierd. I also thought the same about myself at that time, how in the hell what type of lonely guy I am who is comforting himself on his own touch, and I cried more after thinking this. I thought that how much lonely guy I am that I'm feeling my own touch. like how much I needed just someone to love me, to comfort me, and that being myself only, I cried another wave after thinking this thing.This has never happened to me before, I know some things like symptoms of being a psycho, but I couldn't justify myself at this.

No, I'm not any mentally ill or something guy. I'm totally normal. it's just that the friends left after school are being very hard bitches and I just don't feel like talking to them, so atm I've no friends (maybe for near future too) THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I'M LONELY. I don't know what I'm trying to say at this point, mostly just see what I've become now, and idk if that's true or even what is THAT. I know to most of you this would be sounding so much stupid, it would to me too when I'll read it sometime later.

He’d force him to sit in a highchair as punishment, sometimes for several hours. He’d spank him on the souls of his feet (I guess this is an Egyptian thing). 

He tried to show me love but for whatever reason I just never loved him back. My mother was far from perfect but strangely I’m able to love and forgive her.

I really feel like they don’t try in my life or my sons life (he’s a year old). I watch them do everything for my sister while I’m doing everything for them. even my younger brother pointed it out and then my mom made him feel guilty and turned him against me. I feel my mom gaslights me anytime I express being upset(you’re thinking of it wrong, you’re being negative), I’m told I am ungrateful and then I need to stop thinking negative things. When I talk about my childhood abuse, she used to just pretend that it never happened.  Now she uses the excuse that her dad did it to her and she didn’t know better. (Shes had multiple people tell her it was wrong as she did it). I feel like I can’t really communicate with my mom without her getting upset and pointing out my flaws or telling me how to think. 

Lately I feel really guilty for going no contact. Especially after yesterday when she texted (after a month): “I love you and miss you and hope you and the baby are ok I worry about you every day. “. I don’t know what to think. The last time we texted was a month ago after she expressed wanting to see my son. When I told her I was in town if she wanted to see my son a few days later.  All I got in response was “ok”

Sometimes I Think I’m wrong and that the abuse wasn’t that bad. That I’m a bad person for not forgiving. That I really am being ungrateful. That I’m a bad mom for keeping my son from them.

For context: Been NC with NDad for 3 years but last month had to attend a funeral / family reunion for my moms younger brother (was a sudden tragic death ) and kept low contact with my Dad. A few awkward AF moments but I dodged any abuse by grey rocking. It was so nice to be with my extended family who I’ve had to stop seeing since being NC. I cried when I left. 

It’s been about two weeks and My EMom stopped calling or interacting with me.  We usually talk 2-3x a week. I just opened my mailbox to a hand written letter from her — demanding I speak to my Dad and reconcile for “the family’s sake”  and saying I QUOTE “we will not apologize.” The letter was ridiculous and riddled with a bunch of gaslighting bullshit also saying that the “whole family” was uncomfortable at the reunion because of ME.

The letter’s tone did not sound like her at all, and I know my Ndad abused her into writing it. It read like a kidnapper being held against their will to write a ransom note. 

I spiraled out of control yesterday after receiving and my nervous system is on edge. I love my Mom but she’s weak and has become extremely toxic especially since covid (I’m sure being quarantined with a narc does that.)  She’s always pushed my boundaries with my NDad and has been an alcoholic / abusing pain meds for most of my adult life to suppress her pain. She’s somewhat sober now (from what I know) but I’m wondering if this is a situation  where I have to go NC with her as well because she’s a flying monkey and enabling contact &amp; further abuse from my NDad 

I love her so much, she is such a good person but is mentally sick due to the 30+ years of abuse. I’m worried about her but I’m her child— this isn’t my job. She should protect me and not the other way around.

They're brainwashed by the Chinese Communist Party and when COVID hit, they put their beliefs even more in the Communist Party through their WeChat social networks.

This was not good, my nDad kept saying I was fucking useless, worthess, fat and a failure at life. My nMom kept enabling bad behavior that led me into more debt.

Finally, a opportunity came to me to move out to someone I have a connection to in that my former best friend's significant others' mother was offering a room that was picked with my needs in mind. It started off great, but as I tried to settle, old behaviors I had habitually recalled combined with my ASD amplified this new landlord's distrust far more than expected, to the point it became hairtriggers.

The issue stemmed from one of our local ISPs deliberately sabotaging custom DNS settings in their routers. It intercepted and blocked a custom DNS like Cloudflare and unfortunately due to the anger exhibited it was impossible to relay that information to her. She didn't care what info and evidence was presented, she wanted to prove I was in the wrong through any means possible.

She then completely cut off internet access as a means of discipline. Something that was helping me settle was taken away and I went into mental distress.

During this, she repeatedly said ""This is life, just grow up."" and ""Just be normal, behave properly like all other people."" This resulted in more mental distress, a mental pain scale of 9/10 (with 10/10 being unable to function)

Through a couple more weeks of observation it was clear she was a narcissist. Why else would she be so off put by ""invasion of her space"" to such an extreme extent over something a regular person can try to reason with after time has passed? It was made worse by my upbringing and ASD combined meaning I need more help with my behavior rather than scoldings. She only deals with rehabilitating vulnerable youth straight out of juvenile hall, so she has no experience with an adult on the spectrum. Especially not an adult on the spectrum from a bad upbringing. She also believes therapists are cash hogs, who are there to siphon cash from vulnerable people, and that discipline works better than instruction or therapy.

The next thing she did was, on my birthday, instead of respecting my wishes for a birthday at a specific location, went to a completely different location and stated that I lost all my rights to decisions and respect. At the same time, she used the opportunity of me being out of the house to change locks into deadbolts basically turning my space into a prison, where I have no rights except to shelter, THEIR food and THEIR water.

That's not even the worst part, she purposely makes an effort to keep vulnerable people in her care needy of her support, instilling fear into her clients to ensure she gets government payouts for each client for as long as possible. She purposely spoke down to one of her clients to instill fear that if he interacted to me to gain skills and more independence, she will threaten him with something (like eviction or quitting her job to end cash flow for the entire household) just to keep him in his place. Instead of gaining friendships in the house, she wants everything to remain the same, to the point she will use extreme measures to instill fear. (and that lines up with discipline)

I'm using my phone's data connection to even make this post. I can't browse sites like I normally do, and even my social worker, who's supposed to help, saw a ""disrespect"" in her perspective more believable than explaining how it came from habits that I have a hard time coping with. I am currently at a 10/10 on the mental health pain scale. I can't imagine it getting any worse, but I know it can.

To give you an idea how little support I get, I got no therapy, psychologists or psychiatrists after turning 18. It didn't happen until I turned 27. And now the same support circle isn't there for me as I've aged into a ""responsible adult"" stereotype age. To make things worse, I was isolated from the rest of the students in my school in both Elementary and High School. College I was kicked out after the first semester for the same ""behavior"" as someone who hasn't gotten continuous support for ASD after turning 18. Back when my nParents begged my old teachers to reinstate my education for college, at least they fought for me. Now nobody fights for me because ""You should know better.""

HOW?!? How am I supposed to know better when I come from narcissistic abuse and get thrown into narcissistic discipline for delinquents?

If I had been able to stick with it it would have set me for life.

My boyfriend (now ex) at the time helped me get it. I was so excited and I worked hard for it (at least in my opnion).

However my father had such an issue with the job. At every turn he said that I shouldn't work and I should give it up. Why couldn't I just be grateful for what he was providing for me.

One morning he almost hit me and my mom had to physically stop him from doing it.

Along with all the stressors a new job brings I had to deal with his rage every single day.

After a week of working I left the job. It absolutely broke my heart and my boyfriend told me he was so disappointed in me that I couldn't even handle a simple job and that I had no goals or dreams.

It hurt so freaking much.

 I feel like my father would have not only ruined my life but also my families life if I had kept working. In that time my father threatenes my mom with divorce.

Even though I only went for a week I miss it to this day. I wish I had been stronger and had kept going to the job. Now whenever I think of it I feel sick to my stomach. Maybe I didn't make the right decision. Maybe if I had stuck with it I could have gone NC with my father.

Everyone I talked to at the time (my mother, my friends) adviced me I should stop working.

 My boyfriends first promised he would help out with things I needed but once the job started he starting flaking on me. He promised for the first month he would take me to work and bring me back since I didn't have a license yet (still don't,  another forbidden thing from my parents), but when the time came he asked me to take uber instead and that became so expensive that I couldn't afford going to the job.

I asked my father for help with funds and that I would pay him back once I got my salary and he absolutely refused. And yes he has enough to help out.

I needed my ID card to open a bank account to get my salary and he (my father) didn't give it to me... (he has had it hidden with him for years now) so I couldn't even get a bank account opened. He said he didn't believe in me working so he wouldn't allow me to open an account.

Now I'm jobless, depressed and alone. And I keep think maybe I should have stuck with it. But idk how. I had no funds. No support. I was broke. The worst thing was I had no way of going to or coming back from there. I didn't know anyone there yet so I couldn't ask anyone for help. The one person that i did know (my boyfriend) told me to buck up and figure it out myself and that he was too busy to deal with me.

Now whenever I think of an airport I think of that job and it makes me want to cry. I wish things would have been different. I enjoyed working a lot that one week and I think that job would have made me so happy.

I know our choices makes up our lives and I feel like I could have done so much better then I did. I want it to have been different but I see no other way of it going at the time. The whole situation just confuses me to this day

For my entire life, it was just me (19F) and my mother(40F). She left my father because he's the worst so it was just the two of us. She was very lonely when I was little, she got a boyfriend, moved in really fast, and I was molested at age 3. She said things over the years that seem like she had a feeling about it, but she'd never admit that. She said. ""I tried to leave you with his sister when I could"", ""He asked me if I had kids when we met"", and my personal favorite, ""I never knew how much I loved you until you were molested."" She's also been very close to me, saying I'm her best friend, I'm her reason for living, and then turning around and screaming at me for small things and saying she'll go kill herself because I don't need her anymore. I never knew it wasn't normal until a boyfriend I had (now husband) said it wasn't normal I never spoke ill of her. How could I, when she seemed to know everything? I always feared she'd find out if I did. She recently moved across the country from me almost a full month ago and her not being around me all the time has made me remember a lot of yelling, slapping, spanking, etc and it's been a lot. Going through this subreddit, though, I saw some people mention how their nparents would make them show off clothes, force themselves into dressing rooms, etc and I didn't know that wasn't normal. My mother insisted on kissing me on the mouth until I was 16. I was clearly uncomfortable, but she didn't care and it just pissed her off. She only stopped because my then-boyfriend said something to her. She would often talk about my boobs and how they were sooo big, much bigger than hers, and that I should show them off. She'd then talk about how nice my butt was and it always made me uncomfotable. I don't know if any of that would be considered sexual abuse, because she never like touched my genitals or anything, but even when I was really young she'd talk about sex and her sex life. She'd also always be naked around the house, even as I got older, and when I made it clear I didn't want to see her naked, she'd almost always find a way to make me see her naked, like calling me into her room for something when I didn't know what she was doing or like forcing me to talk to her when she's in her towels. It always made me uncomfortable and she didn't stop until she moved AWAY. I know she'd still do it if I was near by. She'd also talk about her vagina out of nowhere and I never wanted to hear it, but she'd keep talking about that stuff. She'd always walk in on me when I was in the shower and would pull back the curtain. She only stopped when I was 13, but even then she'd still come into the bathroom while I was in the shower to like talk or whatever. Additionally, when I had my first pap smear she insisted on being in the room. She was in a corner and couldn't see anything, but she demanded to be in the same room. I know this is a lot, but what do you guys think? I love her and care for her, but she also told me I was literally conceived so someone would love her because she didn't feel loved by my father or her parents. I just don't know what to think. It hurts a lot. I still text her now that she's gone and call sometimes, but just last night she started bitching at me because I asked why she calls when I don't text back? And then she went off on me because it's always her that calls and she thinks I'm glad she's gone.

Its seems kinda really stupid for me to ask for things that my parents think that I won't.. I shouldn't need... Like a room ..
 Or just let me sleep on the floor on mattress or like having my own money.. like from a part time job.. I know the socio economic factors won't let me do that .. but like online..just let me try... Let me have something to do..let me have a coping mechanism other that daydeaming

And like they've been telling me that my father will build a new house( there's no house to buy so every family builds their own ) and like I was a little happy and hopefull but realized they were just bragging and lieing to themselves and us 
.. and they also said they that will happen 5 to 6 years later.. wow..

So yeah I am really pissed of my life and them and my sister and myself

And also I wish my Baba would reduce drinking and make an effort to change being a mess that is ruining his extensions aka daughters (that they hope would be boys so they  tried 2 times and also discussing about another boy siblings) ( oh they were so disappointed and I don't know how they reacted at my time) ..and save some time and money and mindfulness 

And I wish my Mamma would stop seeing my father as this god who pays for what we eat and a great guy ...and seeing us like the mess and the investments that is not going as that poorly planned that is the reason for their misery 

And fuck the socio economic factors and the country I've been born to that has left me with no options

And the hobby aka the coping mechanism and hopefully be something that will help me not starve to death.. so that I could be a little less sociopathic and sane ... Hopefully.. I tried to pick up on a lot of hobbies.. but I end up not having the supplies like .. like watercolor painting.. it's recent.. and I even thought of making watercolor paper by recycling old used paper and it work the first time but my sister kept interupting me and Mamma saw what I was doing and stopped me

As I got older, I’m noticing her reactions to the things I do and it’s kind of, if not worse, similar to those of my mother.

What happened recently really creeped me out. I feel like I’m literally being watched. This all started in January when my grandma and family found out I had a boyfriend, courtesy of my cousin telling her. This may not seem like a big deal but my family are fundamentalist religious folks so any deviance from what they deem right is a grave sin. So when she found out she called me a disgrace to our family and made up a bunch of disgusting lies. She began spreading those lies to people in my family and it’s got to me through an aunt. Her acting like I did some crime is one thing but lying about it is another. Like who tf does that.

Anyways, recently my mom came into my room and told me my grandma saw me recently walking on one of these streets. I remember that day because that was the only day I used that route to work. So she told me my grandma, in her car, saw me, and stopped to “watch” me. I don’t know if I’m overreacting but I find this so creepy. I asked my mom what day it was, and she didn’t ask. So now I have an admission from my toxic grandma that’s she’s literally stalking me. 

I have a feeling she is doing this to “catch” me doing something bad (like meeting up with a guy friend or doing drugs or something???  Literally don’t do anything “bad” besides talking to guys). What makes me really angry is the fact that my grandma didn’t stop to offer me a ride on this hot day, nor did she beep her horn at all to see if I’m okay or where I’m going. She literally just watched me. Something about that rubs me the wrong way.

Now that I know that my anxiety has gotten worse. I always had really bad anxiety with the irrational feeling that someone was watching me and I always told myself it’s not true… but now it is. Now I have a reason to believe those thoughts because of my grandma. I really wish I wasn’t a people pleaser and would’ve told her off. Idc about being disrespectful anymore, she doesn’t respect me whatsoever. 

I’m hoping someone could give me advice. I feel so restricted. I feel like my whole family is out to get me.

A bit of background: 

My mother was diagnosed with BPD after years of alcoholism and my childhood was just trauma after trauma. Physical, psychological, emotional and sexual abuse was prominent. I also endured bullying, death of the only stable people in my life and later drug and alcohol abuse. 

After years of therapy/ getting clean, and studying I reached a position where I could go to university, which was a massive thing for me. I took the opportunity to move away to give myself a fresh start and my Nmother has been nasty and resentful about it ever since. She cried endlessly before, during and even now three years later not to mention the endless guilt trips. 

Her unstable nature has meant I’ve always been the provider and the one holding her up, including relying on me for money because she cannot handle her finances or take care of herself. In the first year of uni this lead to me seeking help and having to get a grant because I had no money. I then had to get a job which has really effected my university work and I’m failing. 

There is a lot more but you can probably fill the blanks. 

Back to now:

I’m in a situation where I’m between places,I’ve had to come out of work temporarily and my psychotherapist says I’m not in a place to deal with childhood trauma and stopped my sessions so I can concentrate on uni work and actually finish my degree. My Nmother is spirally down and it’s guilt trip and selfishness every day, she hasn’t asked about how I am never mind how university is going, at one point she said well you can just come home and say you tried. 
Today she asked me for money and I said what happened to the last amount I gave her a week ago, she responded that she wasn’t going to take this attitude from me and hit me with “fine I’ll just have nothing that’s ok”. It transpired into her saying “I wont bother you anymore, thanks for the support, I’m on my own now and I have to deal with that”. I explained that I’m still here for her I just can’t help her with money and she said “it’s not about the money, you’ve hurt me and I’m on my own now”. I defended myself and said so you only want me when you need money from me and any other form of support isn’t good enough (baring in mind I’ve spent my whole life supporting this person who has done nothing but give me psychological trauma) and that’s when she said: 

“Don’t forget it was you who moved away to get on with your life and left me on my own. It’s not about the money it’s about your hurtful words and lack of respect. I’m finding it very difficult to hold my tears in and put on a brave face” 

I’m shocked, upset and angry. This textbook manipulation is getting to me and her inability to think about anyone but herself is sending me over the edge. I’m ranting here because I’ve spent the last two hours crying and unable to contain these feelings, and the kicker is i also feel guilty and like I’m a bad person. She has expressed that she has no issues killing herself if she didn’t have me and this is what twists my stomach.

I just don’t know what to do anymore and my own mental health is suffering.

Basically I have been mad at my Nmum since yesterday when she embarrassed me at the dentist so i keep telling her to leave me alone when she asks me questions. 

Here is the link to that post:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p7dy58/i_actually_hate_my_nmum_she_lied_to_me_and_then/

So basically this morning when woke up around 11:00 I went downstairs to get the house phone to call my gp (I live in England so that's what they are called idk what they are called in  other countries or of you guys even have them) because I had this medical issue for the past two days that wouldn't go and the house phone wasn't working so I decided to call them on my phone and I decided to stay inviting room when calling them because I was tol tired to move of the couch.

 As I was calling GP my mum asked who I was calling and I told her the GP and then she proceeded to ask me a billion different times what was wrong and what my medical issue was and I didnt want to tell her because I was still mad at her and this women who is my mother litterly startred to cry when I wouldn't tell her in response I told her I don't have to tell you everything about me and she said that since she is my mother that no I do have to tell her everything and I just didn't respond and just spoke to the receptionist at the gp and she advised me to go to my local pharmacist for my issue.

I hung up the phone and my mum was still crying and insisting I tell her whats wrong and at this point she was annoying me so I just told her and then she was like what do you want for breakfast and i told her I dont want anything and to nonsense surprise she satreed crying again that I wouldn't eat anything.

(Btw my Nmum quite literally has an obsession with me eating and at one point it got too much and I even had a emotional breakdown over it. I will write this story afterwards because I want it to be it's own separate post).

And I just left and told her to stop crying since all I did was not tell her what was wrong me it at first and say I didn't want to eat any food and I don't think that's stuff to cry over.


And another thing my Nmum made about her is the passing of my uncle a month ago.

Basically sadly my uncle passed away a month ago and him and my auntie were pretty much the only family members I didn't hate and he was just amazing which is the opposite of his toxic daughter and my cousin.

And every since my mum found out and she would talk to someone about my uncles death or tell them that he is dead she would be would go from normal to balling her eyes out and then when she would hung up the phone she would immediately stop crying (there was only this one time she continued to cry after hanging up and I think the reason she did that was because me and my sister were in the same room as her and i think she wanted the attention to be on her).

And my Nmum would even cry when on the phone to my uncles family aka my cousins and auntie and they were sooooo annoyed at her that they would immediately hung up the phone the second my Nmum would start to ball her eyes out.

And then my Nmum mum also cried infront of everyone at my uncles infront of his kids and my auntie and one of my cousins even confronted her and again I think the reason she did that was for attention.

Like I'm not saying my Nmum isn't allowed to cry I'm just saying after the whole crying whole on the phone and not crying after hanging up and only crying infront of people just made it suspicious.

Like even when me, my Nmum my sister and my uncles family went to see my uncles body for the first time since he passed she was the only person not to cry idk maybe she ran out of tears or something but if she missed him soo much that she would cry whenever someone was around why didnt she do it then it just sounds suspicious overall.

context, I’ve recently gone no contact with my mother, who acts as the enabler to my father who was physically and emotionally abusive to me as a child. I haven’t spoken to him in many many years, but whenever this comes up in conversation with my Mum she acts surprised like this is brand new information. In other words, she gaslights the shit out of me.

This week she tried to get me into a situation where I’d have to have myself and my kids around my Dad and I put my foot down, told her enough was enough and never to contact me again. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I’ve given her way way too many chances.

Anyway, as you can see, when I went NC, I said don’t contact ME. So what arrived today in our letterbox? A letter addressed to my 14 year old son. 

I asked him what his thoughts were and he immediately said ‘throw it away. I’m not interested in joining her army against you’

He’s fucking 14 and he knew what she was doing better than I did. He was able without knowing anything about flying monkeys to see that she was trying to turn him into one.

It actually made a lot of the anger I had go because when people see and validate stuff when you’ve been gaslit your entire life it’s like someone giving you a blanket.

I do try and shield him from a lot of this but it’s difficult to know how to navigate stuff like this. The letter is gone, we didn’t read it or return it. My parents live in another country so they have had very little involvement in my children’s lives. 

I just hugged him and told him how proud I was of him. I’m in the UK but fortunate enough that I have access to private therapy which I’ve decided to pursue starting next month.

I'm curious, does anyone else suffer through body image issues or dysmorphia due to their Nparent(s) violating personal boundaries? 

My Nmom would occasionally do really weird things while I was growing up that left a bit of scarred mental imagery in my head. My earliest memory of this is when I was very young (around 2nd grade), she called me over to talk to me about something. She was in a robe - ONLY a robe, nothing under - and sitting with her legs wide open at the top of the stairs. 
So I saw everything. Clearly. And when I gave an understandably shocked and confused expression, not sure how to react or what to think, she said ""Yes I'm naked"" as if annoyed she even had to say it, or maybe that I was looking at her like that. 
I don't understand why she couldn't at least close her legs, or better yet, put on more than just a robe. 
To date, I make sure I'm at least trimmed if not totally shaven, because if I don't then all I see is something that disgusts me, in the same vein as seeing a really gross bug. 

I could be wrong, but I don't actually think this is normal behavior, to parade yourself around your kid, or make them do things like shower with you. (Which she did every now and again, especially at public pool showers.)

She would also act weird about my own bodily autonomy as well. She didn't let me get my first bra until at least a year after I clearly needed one (when I finally brought up hearing boys in my class say they could see my nipples through my shirt), she didn't want me to shave anything aside from my legs, and she'd say things like how she wanted me to lose my virginity in her house while she was home (gag).

And growing up, I had no idea how much that crossed into personal boundaries, or that I'd still be affected as an adult. 

This is also only the tip of the iceberg, I don't wanna go into all the little things she did. But anything that looks like her on my body, even remotely, makes me feel ugly and gross.

The three of them decided they would ""come in for tea"" today when coming to collect the dog on the way back from the airport. 

This didn't suit me for several reasons:

1. I'm working from home and the time they'll arrive would be long past my lunch break - I can't just abandon work for an hour. My team are very busy this week because two people are about to go on annual leave.
2. I just got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday so I'm not fully protected from coronavirus yet and they're straight off a plane. I'm not really comfortable with them being in my apartment - especially since my SO is high risk.
3. Further to the point above, I don't feel very well after my vaccine. I'm a bit achy and faint and don't feel up for hosting tea for everybody.
4. I don't want my Nsister in my apartment at all - we're not close and we don't get along. She never has anything nice to say to me.
5. To be frank, I just didn't like them DECIDING they were all coming in to my home with no consideration for whether or not it suited me. This was the main reason I thought this would be a good time for establishing some boundaries.

I woke up this morning and decided I would slightly exaggerate my symptoms from the vaccine and use them as an excuse for not being able to host tea. I told my non-N sister who understood and said that was perfectly OK - she'd just collect the dog at the door.

About 20 minutes ago, my Nmom called me. Non-N sister had gone to go get something in the airport so she used this time to ring me and passive-aggressively guilt-trip me.

""I would have loved to come in with Nsister but...we won't come near you. I even bought you a cake for us to all have together but I suppose you can just eat it yourself now.""

""That's really nice of you to buy a cake, thank you,"" I replied. ""I have a birthday card for your birthday next week so I can give you the card when you give me the cake.""

""Yeah...I would have loved to come in...but...we can't...we won't come near you.""

""......Alright.""

I wasn't unkind or impolite but I was firm.

No, you are not coming in.  
Yes, it was very nice of you to buy a cake.  
No, that still doesn't mean you can come in.

Then, my daughter and I were just sitting in the bedroom we slept in at the Nparents' and I was merely TRYING to decompress because I'm an introvert and need alone time to function. NDad sees me just sitting on the bed just minding my own business and he decides to start shit, towards my NM nonetheless,  ""Tired Empath doesn't want to watch that shit"". Then they start fighting, all because I wanted a few fucking minutes to myself. 

Why can't they just you know, let other people enjoy things without being assholes and putting them down? I'm so glad I don't live close to these people. I'm so glad to be in my own home and I get to enjoy most things in peace. As for visiting my Nparents in the future, I think it's off the table.

TLDR: Mom has severed BP (Bipolar Disorder) with psychosis and caused so much trauma due to her disorder, suicide attempts, kidnapping after being taken away by CPS. When i tried explaining that I had it bad also (in reference to my siblings) her response was the worst that happened to me was being taken away. It's such a narc thing to say and not self aware.


Long story: My mom has SEVERE BP, to the point that many doctors who've treated her have told me it's the worst 
case they've seen. (19-25 yrs old i was always there to pick up the pieces arriving at hopsitals after multiple suicide attempts among other things) 

Anyway... I was confronting my mom about the realities of things in the past and how I've also had it badly. (Everyone in my family likes to comment on who had it worst, ofc it's the ""squeeky wheels"" squeeky wheel gets the fix) I've always been a dissociative and just check out and stay quiet (but it doesn't mean im not suffering) 

they use ridiculous logic and say my oldest brother had it worst because he was old enough, then my youngest sister had it worst because she was so young. Like, do they not see the cognitive dissonance? 

Well, i was having to argue my case like a lawyer that i too have had it bad. And i asked her to think of what might have been bad. She responded, ""YOU WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM ME"". (CPS took us away i was a foster kid after age 16) 

How deluded must one be to think as a person who caused/causes trauma that the worst thing that happened to their child was they were taken away from a person who was the source of the trauma? I was a child trapped with person suffering manic psychosis under their care it was terrifying being around them. My phone was taken away i wasn't allowed to communicate with the outside world.

Basically my wife and I arranged for my 17 year old sister to come up to London and stay with us on Friday night and Saturday night. I booked time off work, we bought a new blow-up mattress specifically, we were going to pick them up and drop them off, we have stocked the cupboards with food/ drinks they like etc.

We live in a studio apartment and my wife gets up and leaves for work at 5am in the morning on Monday, so we said that Sunday night wouldn’t work. Both of my sisters planned to stay elsewhere on this night which was fine with us. Well my 20 year old sister who had her own plans changed them so now she was staying Friday and Saturday night with us. We said that was fine as long as my 17 year old sister didn’t mind sharing the blow- up mattress (the 20 year said “I presume it’s fine”, but never actually asked). Anyway, my 17 year old sister had booked her return coach for Monday as my two sisters were staying elsewhere on Sunday night as they were going to a gig together. The 20 year old had arranged alternate accommodation but hadn’t mentioned this to us or my 17 year old sister, who now had nowhere to stay.

As I had made crystal clear, having them stay with us on Sunday night wouldn’t be a possibility because my wife has to leave for work at 5am (even on a Bank Holiday). I suggested she could change her coach ticket which is an easy process as I’ve done it before. My wife, however, kindly agreed to sleep on the blow-up mattress so that my 17 year old sister could stay. My 20 year old sister’s response to this was (directed at me and ignoring my wife),  “ummm, so are you going to pick ‘17 year old sister’ up?” I asked where the gig was and it was a 2 hour round trip. I didn’t want to spend my Sunday night travelling across London on the tube to pick up my sister so I said the 20 year old sister could drop her off with us.

That’s when all hell broke loose.

My mum sent me a message telling me that she’s “not impressed with my lack of understanding”, that I could have “put myself out for her just this once”, that my 20 year sister is back with her boyfriend and that’s why she couldn’t drop my sister off (???), that I could go to the gig (I’m 29) and see my 20 year old sisters boyfriend’s band play and then bring my 17 year sister home, that it’s “not possible” for my 20 year old sister to drop my 17 year sister off with us. She phoned me three times in quick succession even though I said I didn’t want to talk and said “why aren’t you answering?” That she was “rather surprised”, she was “disappointed”, it was all “difficult and unexpected” etc. etc. etc.

So for some context, I didn’t go to my graduation because my parents didn’t want to drive the 3 hour journey. They said, “I didn’t care anyway, did I?” My mum berated me to the point of tears on my wedding day in front of my friends because I wanted to stay an extra day with my newly wed wife to support her as her grandfather died in hospital. That extra day was the last time my wife ever saw her grandfather. The list goes on and on and on.

This is the first time in my life I’ve ever even suggested that I didn’t want to do what they asked of me, and now they’ve basically exiled me from the family. My 17 year old sister cancelled her trip, my 20 year old sister is going to the gig and staying with friends but doesn’t want to see me, and my dad messaged me saying that my 20 year old dropping off my 17 year old sister “wasn’t a possibility” and that the 17 year old is “really disappointed” but there was “no good blaming anyone else”. Who does that leave to blame?

This, however, is the first time in my life I’ve actually stood up for myself. I am allowed to have my own life, I am allowed to say no and I’m allowed to be fucking angry with my parents. I feel like this is the first step to reclaiming my life and my own identity and I had to reach absolute rock-bottom to get here. If they don’t want to speak to me again, that’s fine with me. I don’t need them and NC will actually make my recovery easier.

UPDATE 

Since I posted this all members of my direct family, my two sisters, my mum and my dad, have proceeded to shame me and tell me how disappointed they all are in me and how I’ve let them all down. The last message I sent to my parents was this, “I don’t have to defend or explain myself to you. If that’s how you want to see it then fine 🤷‍♂️ x”. I even felt the need to message my best man to warn him that my sister might send him messages about my “betrayal”. 

I’m going to go no-contact for as long as I deem necessary. I am not backing down on this and, because of their response, if we do talk again it’s going to be on my terms and my terms only. That won’t be for a few months at least though. I need to focus on my mental health and, to be honest, they are nothing but a burden.

You are lost in the 70s, in someone else's life.  You should be seriously alarmed the you are somehow living my damn childhood.  That's weird buddy. You have a responsibility to your son to make an effort to come back and live in the now.  You're missing out on your actual life.  Wake up!

I have a psychotherapist, who I love, but it’s after hours so I can’t talk to her right now. I really need someone.

My mom hits every mark of a covert narc. My dad is the enabler, well I thought, but lately I’m thinking he’s abusive in his own way outside of the enabling.

I had a breakdown tonight. My mom said something that to some people is seemingly harmless, but it set me off. Basically she gave me a list of things SHE wanted me to do while I’m out of state for college. One being “I want you to work out twice a week and I want you to eat better.” It triggered me bad (food, exercise, disordered eating, bad memories). I got upset.

It led to my dad telling me I’m over-reacting, I’m mean to my mom, I don’t know how to communicate with her, I made a big deal out of nothing, “something bad is going to happen one day and if she dies you’ll feel horrible for how I treat her.”

He told me I need to forgive her and put all the abuse in the past except it still happens. Both of them gaslit the hell out of me. I was getting very upset and started having a panic attack but all my dad could say was stop crying and he kept shushing me.

I had my panic attack in my closet and called a crisis line. I feel better, but I can’t sleep and I move back onto campus in like 6 hours.

I’m working so hard with my therapist to do stuff that’s healthier for me, but they keep doing stuff like this that makes me spiral. 

I’m also trying hard not to victim blame myself. I tend to be very on edge with my mom. I’m jumpy and generally annoyed when she speaks to me even if she’s not doing anything particularly wrong. I honestly resent the hell out of her and can’t stand her most of the time. I feel really bad for that and it makes me feel like I “deserve” it. I’m learning that I feel this way because of the abuse not the other way around. I just feel very guilty. 

I’m going into my second year of college out of state. I really want to go no contact for my sanity, but that’s not possible atm. I hope to move out next summer, so that’s when.

Until then, I was thinking about either low contact or grey rock. I think grey rock is interesting, but I feel like I’m too emotional. I get so irritated, anxious, angry, hurt, and scared when I talk to them sometimes that I don’t think I could manage giving those vague, emotionless responses. Hell, I was shaking and crying tonight when my dad was talking to me.

I think low contact might be better for me for that reason, but I’m wondering what the rest of you think.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713715,public,self,I need help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p7xsyg/i_need_help/,some_ads,7,trigger,b2054a34-2e05-11e5-9284-0e184320b869,[Trigger Warning: Enabling],,,,,,,,,,

Im 17F, diagnosed with depression and bpd. I am quite sure my mother has bpd as well (especially since it can be hereditary) and Im aware bpd and npd tend to be combined with each other.

Throughout my life, she has given me the ""tough love"" treatment. I was the mixed race child w a man she never loved, so I suppose I always reminded her of that. She herself was a victim of abuse by this man and her own parents (generational things, different ways of raising kids).

She often threatened both me and my younger sister (whom she may favor since shes not half white and is the daughter of a she loved) with abandonment, with one old family video depicting my mother threatening to send 5yr old me away. As for abuse, it's mostly emotional but can be physical. I get most of the physical abuse. A few months ago my therapist called cps over an incident where my mother kicked me and tried pushing me down the stairs. Since then my moms gotten nosy abt my therapy and tells me what I can or cant say, and says she's now wary of me bc Im making a story to get her in trouble (fyi cps didnt do anything because it was a one time incident for them).

A few months ago I was suffering from suicidal ideation, and whereas my mom cried for me then, now she says she only cried because she was depressed herself, and when I asked if she really wanted me dead, she replied with ""are you threatening me?"" Though to be fair, during the cry session she said that if I committed suicide itd seem like she failed as a mother.

In fact, she is very much all about her appearance, saying that I should fix so-so about my behavior because it reflects on her. ""What am I supposed to say to my friends when my daughter is lazy and useless?"" She also discourages my sister and I from ever telling anyone ""family problems."" I recall when I was 14, I broke down crying at school and went to the counselors office because someone told me that my mom never loved me, and I got triggered by that. I pretty much confessed everything to that counselor, it was my first time meeting one. When I got home that day, I told my mom what happened, and she yelled at me for telling ""family problems"" to the school counselor. I regretted telling her that. I regret most things I tell her.

It's not like we're ever encouraged to tell her thingd anyway. Sure, she says ""never keep secrets from me, Im your mother"" but whenever we are honest with her we get scolded. And every conversation always deflects to her and her own pain and suffering and how we, the children, have to step up to help her. We're ""too young"" to have problems of our own, and yes, we acknowledge that she did grow up dirt poor and worked to send money to her family, but certainly falling back on that story every time doesn't justify it right?

She always tells stories about herself and makes herself sound so inspiring and whatnot, with the whole growing up outta poverty and being  ""open minded,"" yet she never listens to anyone other than herself. She's homophobic, racist (once threatened to cut me off should I ever marry a black person, because ""theyre  all witches""), inappropriately sexualizes her teenage daughters (""you look like a whore, maybe if youre raped youll learn"") and puts them in danger.

Before vaccines, I once told her that we needed to leave her favorite restaurant because it was obvious that CDC guidelines for covid were not being followed at all, abd the place was packed of maskless people. She got super pissy and told me ""what, are you afraid to die? my immune system is strong enough"" even though millions have died. When she finally did comply, I later asked if she had hand sanitizer, to which she pulled her own out and used it but didnt share it with me. She gets her ""science"" from facebook, reptilian conspiracy theorists, and a preacher on youtube who claims people get sick because they left god. 

She also just... doesnt stop when we tell her to. She sometimes grabs our private areas in jest, and with me, Id told her multiple times I hate it when she compares me to my dad (a horrible person) or describes the US as ""your country"" or ""your people here"" (for context, im asian american, not born in the us, basically raised racist against my white side). Shell be all sweet and apologize in that sarcastic tone, but she doesnt stop it. In this family, we never learned ""no."" 

I get the brunt of most of it, but for both my sister and I, she's never asked about our interests, our feelings, never cares for our pride and achievements (unless shes comparing us to a friends kid) and constantly expects us to read her mind regarding stuff like housework, which she never really taught us to do ""properly"". When we ask to be taught how, were criticized for not knowing. 

Aaaaanyway. I think that's enough writing lol. I didnt wanna just assume she was narcissistic because Im no professional (though i guess we'll never know since she hates therapists) but I know a lot of this comes from generational trauma and the poor parenting skills of back then, plus her abusive relationship with my biological father. Regardless, I know that shouldnt justify it happening to us. She uses it to justify her abuse, her ""lack of control"" but I guess I need to hear a second opinion.

I told her she needs to own her actions and words, to deny and deflect is breaking the little bit of relationship we have left down even more and I'm an adult who can make the decision to cut that crap out of my life.

I was born early, almost 3 months, it was a horrible birth, emergency C-section, mother was in a coma for 3 weeks and i was in the NICU for a little over 3 months. I got all the medical care I needed but i was underweight all my childhood due to very very low birth weight, and having been tube fed in the hospital. So why were they abusive? As soon as I could understand the words coming out of their mouths, I was told that i can trust no one.

 Take for example, my father is walking with me in Sears as a 4-5 year old. (I can't remember the age but it was quite young) He always told me never wander off, never run away from him or someone will grab me, cut my head off and throw me in the river like John Walsh's son Adam, who was taken from a Sears. He told me how that little boy was taken from a store like this. 

Okay, peanut butter story. I was a..delicate kid who struggled to gain weight. So, my dad wanted to force feed me. He asked me to eat spoon of peanut butter when i was young. I said no, because I didn't want to. He did not take kindly to my refusal and decided that if I will not eat it, I will wear it. He grabbed me and spread the peanut butter all over my face and put me in the corner. I remember the disgusting feeling of tears going through the paste on my face. It was gross and humiliating and I hated it because i just didn't wanna eat the peanut butter. As of a year ago maybe, he grabbed some peanut butter and a spoon. He tried to get me to eat a spoonful again and i just started screaming at him to fuck off because I'm done with him trying to force feed me. He heavily contributed to the development of my EDNOS (eating disorder) he's shamed people all my life for their weight until it has wormed it's way into my own brain. He'd say bad things even about my own mom, who is not thin.  

My (nice) grandmother has still joked about how i used to have a vice grip on her shirt while i sat in the cart when she took me to the store as a child because i was afraid someone would steal me away. They had their laugh but I didn't. 

My 6th grade teacher held a parent teacher conference once, as she thought i was being abused at home. I believe this was based of my startle response is *very* active, and i flinch at loud noises and sudden movements (i clarify, i was not hit..much) I always took slaps from my mom a couple of times, straight faced. I did face getting spanked by my dad but it was nothing to write home about. 
The thing that bothered me was I have hit my dad and he hit back but one time, i was in my room. We were fighting about something, and raised our voices. But he was getting into my personal space so I went to put my hands on his chest to push him away (not shove him or anything) but he thought i was going to hit him so he smacked me over the head, I backpedaled to go to my bed and he followed smacking my thigh and i was telling him to stop i didn't hit him i just wanted space. I was almost crying and said i just wanted my space. I was shocked and as i was backing up and crawling onto my bed, I was scared. 

I felt as though my dad lacked in the bonding department at some point and i didn't feel as connected to him. He made me a walking stick on a camping trip a long time ago and got angry with me and broke it in half in front of me. He fixed it, but it's shorter than it was. 

Both him and my mother belittle/mock me. A few days ago my dad helped me put on a tanktop in the kitchen (i was wearing a sports bra) and i never felt so uncomfortable in my life having him help me put a shirt on. My mother said I'm like their little doll. 

When I was in Jr. High, i was told i wasn't allowed to go to a school dance. I went anyways, and didn't come home on the bus. When i didn't they freaked out. I got home and they yelled at me, but then they said to get out so i went around the house to go in the backdoor because they wouldn't kick me out. I ended up physically fighting my dad, and although i held out well, did not win and stayed outside. They said they'd keep me out all night, so it got dark and i watched the moon in this old shed that nobody bothered to upkeep. Dad gave me a sleeping bag at some point, so that was decent. I layed there and watched the moon until i saw a blinging light. It was dad with a flashlight telling me to get up and come inside. He told me they let me back in because there's some rapist on the loose, idk. I was glad to be back inside. I complained about this to a couple friends the next day and i guess someone reported it because i went to talk to a lady and she asked a lot about them (I now know that lady was a social worker) i was completely unaware until my parents expressed their displeasure at me telling people and getting them in trouble. 

I can't remember anything else right this moment, that was just the more significant moments. If I think of anything else, I might make a continuation in a comment.

I am leaving to go to college tomorrow. I am excited to finally be free of my nmother’s abuse. She somehow thinks that by citing her “loss of patience” with me (for what? I do all my college paperwork on time despite her endless explosive anger about it, I have stellar study abilities--I have been studying calculus 10+ hours a day for the past week and a half, and she thinks that because I plug my ears to stay sane and shut out her psychotic, out-of-the-blue, multi-hour-long, door-battering screaming sessions about the latest and greatest petty problem, she has a right to “lose patience” with me and therefore kick me out. I kid you not, she had at least 15 individual door-pounding and psychotic screaming sessions today about how I need to sign a piece of paper for vaccination requirements. Her tirade had 1% to do with the problem and 99% to just insult and threaten me. The fact that I am resilient to her psychotic onslaughts which she will do for hours, unstoppably, without any remorse for the horrible things she says about me, does not make her the victim of the abuse she does to me. It makes her the abuser. It’s that simple. The abuser twisting the fact that their victim is resisting them does not make the abuser the victim. Period.    


That being said, one of the common denominators for her favorite things to say during her latest petty explosions is to lie that the fact she and my father wanted to kick me out is somehow proof of how they are the victims when they are abusers, because it would be “unlikely” that both parents are abusive. When I mention that yes, it’s clearly the case, she just laughs dismissively and continues glorifying my violent, physically and emotionally abusive ndad and victimizing herself. 

It’s a way of saying: “Oh, so you think I’m abusive, well, now you have to prove that we’re both abusive! Since you’re in a shattered state of mind from my relentless torture of you for the last half an hour, I'm well aware that you're not in the state to dive into every single one of your most sensitive and traumatic memories from us, so the fact you can’t list every specific instance of obvious abuse proves that I’m right!” 

Remember, she always initiates these abusive gaslighting sessions from the pettiest of everyday circumstances. She's twisted.

Welcome to gaslighting 101, and retreating into generalized fundamentals to force the opposition to overthink and go crazy addressing specifics. Using the fact I survived my textbook abusers to self-victimize will never, ever work. In fact, it’s such a stupidly false argument it hurts to even make sense of. It’s like her many racist, homophobic, anti-vax, covidiot comments that are so immature and false that they hurt to even think about because the mere thought of such absurdities gives them a level of validation far greater than they deserve, which would be none. I can’t wait to go to college and surround myself with positive influences so my reasoning will never again be tainted by petty, psychotic, unempathetic, gaslighting abusers like her.

I’m not able to fully appreciate yet can identify separation of self from people who don’t care for me, and I hope one day I can celebrate that.

For now, I’m also in mourning. I don’t have a mom or a dad to guide or just comfort me through this really fucking hard life change of mine. That isn’t selfish for me to want love, so I give a version of it to myself by not interacting with people dedicated to hurting and dominating me.

Still lonely, rather be alone. I’ll find peace one day, and slowly I’m cutting back on my unhealthy coping mechanisms. I ate a sandwich today, and I *never* used allow myself to keep things in. 

Though last week, I managed the same. It’s slow, but I’m managing to figure out how to care for myself. I’m showering more, I used to not because the air against my wet skin left me fucking FRIGID and in pain for hours after a shower.

My best friend is taking me in. I trust her the most out of everyone I know. I’m so lucky to have her.

I’m getting better. From the abuse, from the coping, from the abhorrent patterns of destruction for realistically, no fucking reason

I’m trying to be accountable. That starts with making myself healthy again, so I can fulfil my duties as a person and take accountability the correct way. Drugging and starving myself to death isn’t retribution for my slights

I’m flying home tomorrow with the intention of talking to my parents and giving them the ultimatum; acknowledge that my father physically abused me and apologize or I will end my relationship with them. No more holidays together. No more phone calls. Nothing. I don’t want to re-hash anything or argue. I just want to hear those two statements, and then I can move on.

For context, I am late-twenties. I was physical abused by my father between the ages of 8 and 13, I was the scapegoat, my mother knew and did nothing, and my siblings knew and also did nothing. To this day I “exaggerated what happened” or “remembered things differently than what actually happened”. When I tried to get help I “was trying to tear apart our family” and when I tried to get my mom to help me I was “the reason she almost filed for divorce”. It all ended abruptly for seemingly no reason and the few times afterwards I ever brought it up dissolved into screaming matches where I was labeled crazy.

I spent the last ten years going to therapy and processing what happened and how it has effected me and my relationships with everyone involved. We have all been civil, there have been no major problems outside of the occasional argument. I have no doubt that in their minds they convinced themselves that they’re right and I’m crazy or maybe even that they think that I moved on and forgot about it. But I didn’t.

I need them to tell me that it was real and that they’re sorry after gaslighting me for basically my whole life or I’m done. It’s not healthy to continue our relationship like this. But I know that they won’t give me that, they’re textbook narcissists. I’ve accepted that this is the end.

My only concern at this point is that I will also lose my relationships with my (also adult) siblings who I am very close with. They have always told me that I exaggerated the situation. They tell me all the time “they do so much for you, you should call them more... why don’t you come home this weekend they miss you... etc. etc.” Their relationships with my parents are fine and they are still financially dependent on them. Knowing them, they will take my parents’ side and that will be that.

(I don't speak for all foreign parents its just I noticed this trend a lot with them)This is especially hard for me since my parents are basically funding my college and I litteraly live with them. I can't just move out, even though I technically can. Moving out would mean being cut off and not having any way to pay for my education, except taking a bunch of minimum wage jobs, and with my lack of expirence and being sheltered I wouldnt be able to make enough money and eventually ending up dropping out of college and in the streets. Prolonging something that could've just been over if I just stuck with them and waited to move out. I don't want to be cut off from my parents I just wish they didn't micromanage my life!

But this is especially hard when you have been entirely dependant on your parents and they take away anything from you that will make you more independent because they'll feel as if you don't think they're good enough parents and that your ""rebelling"". It's really hard and stressful and not everyone has the energy or the strength to just move out. I know I sure as hell don't. Most of us who leave have no where to turn to when we do, so just moving out isn't a viable option, especially for a person who's just been emotionally drained from years of their parents toxic behaviors you can't just expect them to just pick up and go.. it's litteraly this or the streets.

So I think rather than just saying your an adult you can do whatever you want"" People should start advocating for support systems becuse telling an abused person to just leave a relationship with someone they've spent their entire life with doesn't always work.

He has exhibited many symptoms over the years, but has no formal diagnosis. I am posting this to describe a behaviour of his and ask whether or not it is something that is common/recognised in narcissists, so I’ll just get in to it.

He has a real habit of making himself appear as the victim. Constantly. And when I say constantly, it is literally every other story he tells - I say story he tells because there is rarely any real conversation with him, rather just whatever personal story he tell that is remotely relevant to the current topic.

However, as much as he likes to paint himself as the victim, he is often overly and unjustly critical of anyone who has genuinely been victimised.

For example, earlier he was gloating about how he worked through the start of the pandemic, whilst painting himself as a noble victim of circumstance. He then went on to clearly criticise a colleague for working from home because of being classed as ‘vulnerable’, making quoted finger expressions as he says it. I asked him why he made that expression and for what reason they were vulnerable. To cut it short, it was asthma, and basically said it was a rubbish reason and they (people who were told to shield/WFH) were just looking for time off work. When I challenged him on this, he remained blank and did not say anything, and generally speaking, this is his response whenever challenged about something unreasonable he has said that won’t directly end in negative consequence for him.

He also has a real problem with anyone our family knows who receives disability related benefits (e.g. family friends who receive a car as part of disability allowance). It almost seems as if he’s jealous of people who are genuinely disadvantaged and have disabilities in life. The weird part is he has even gone as far as sticking a disabled sticker on his vehicle, and when I’ve asked him about it, he just brushes it off as ‘a joke’. It just feels so weird witnessing his constant attempts at evoking empathy for himself, but also the blatant lack of empathy for anyone else.

I’d like to be able to genuinely enjoy spending time in his company, but when the engagement has become nothing but a systemised and almost robotic sequence of retold stories to paint himself as a victim, I cannot spend much time in his company before feeling as if I need to leave. In fact spending too much time with him is draining - I leave feeling deflated as if the life had been sucked out of me. It usually takes me a good few hours to a day to recover from being in his company. The weight of his negativity just feels crushing.

I’m sure that what I’ve described is hardly anything compared to what some people on this sub are dealing with, but my reason for posting this is to ask whether or not the behaviour I’ve described is common or even recognised behaviour in a narcissist? If so, does the process of self victimisation have a name? Is a lack of response when challenging a narcissist a normal ‘response’ from one? Is it normal to leave a narcissist’s company feeling deflated and drained, as if someone has sucked the joy and spirit out of you, and if so is it normal for it to take an extended period of time to recover from this?

TlDr: Basically a few questions: Is it common for a narcissist to have a victim personality? Is it common for a narcissist to be overly and unjustly critical (to the point of appearing as jealousy) of disadvantaged/disabled people? Is it common to leave a narcissist’s company feeling deflated and drained, as if someone had sucked the life out of you, and is it common for it to take hours to recover from this?",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713667,public,self,A few questions....

Long time lurker, first time post. 
Its taken me so long to post because i just didn't know where to start. So here's a snippet that isn't even the tip of the iceberg. 

I was 7months pregnant (26F) with my first and only child. Ndad and EMom(maybe Nmom) drove 2 hours to visit *unannounced* which was the biggest inconvenience for them by the way. 

Ndad asks ""so how are you feeling? How's it going?"" I reply ""well it honestly sucks, I'm so sore and tired and can hardly walk but it's allright"" 
Him -
 ""should have kept your legs closed then"" 
in that tone.. you all know tone I'm talking about. The *I'm joking but also serious* tone that just makes your blood boil.

I'm 26 and engaged, living away from them for 6 years. That's similar to the shit he would say to me when i was a teenager.

He also proceeded to post a picture of me that was taken without my consent or knowledge (by my nmum who i didn't even want there) only a few hours after giving birth, announcing the arrival of my son. There was obviously a big fight after that because how dare i be upset? I should be grateful. I'm such a selfish bitch.

Just before that my social worker who helps me with transgender stuff, who is an absolute darling and so supportive, confirmed my mother is emotionally abusive from the things I’ve said about her. She’s now effectively the closest thing I have to a mother figure in my life now. 

So, As I got kicked out I slept the night at my Nana’s. Was not nearly as bad as my Nmom claimed, I had a very achey sleep last night cause my nana’s couch is tiny. So when I got back, my mom cried and begged me to forgive her, but I stood my ground telling her she had issues too.

I know I have had experience with narcissists in my life, so I thought this would be the place to go.

I (23) have been dating my bf (24) for almost 2 1/2 years. In that time I've always thought his parents were controlling and a little overbearing. When he told them he wanted to date me his mom said she didn't want him to because of my tattoos and colored hair and piercings because ""what does that say about her as a person"". Over the course of our relationship they have never tried to get to know me and they're all smiles when I come over, but when I leave, they are constantly sitting bf down to have ""adult to adult conversations"" about how he can't focus on his career while also having me in his life. 

This past year I went to residential treatment (rehab) because I had an assault incident come up, but also the past 2 years of constant ""she's not good enough for you"" "" you should break up with her"" ""she doesn't give you enough time for yourself"" pushed me over the edge to the point of me becoming suicidal. 

I came home 2 months ago. 1 week ago bf stayed over my house to comfort me because we were working through something and I didn't want to be alone. No biggie really. The next morning his dad said ""when are you going to break this off? She hasn't changed and neither have you blah blah blah"". Bf was shell shocked and didn't respond and came straight to me to which we made an r/amitheasshole post about our situation. 

Other stuff has happened, but I just feel so hollow. I feel empty. I feel crushed that he loves with them that he talks to them. I tried to go over to his house today, but had a panic attack and disassociated before I could even get out of the car so bf wouldn't let me. I just don't know what to do. They're whole world revolves around everything being exactly how they want it and they dont want me.. I don't know I just feel like I'm rambling at this point. 

And yes bf does do the best he can in all this. He is trying to move out ASAP. Not with me because I'm still in intensive outpatient and I don't want to overwhelm myself, but he is working to get away from them so there's that.

But whenever she got in one of her moods, he would just abandon us to go to his moms or drive around, etc....but now that i'm older, I'm realizing that my bar is so low for someone who is ""nice"". It's not ""nice"" to sit back and watch your wife abuse your kids. It's not ""nice"" to hit a child with cerebral palsy. It's not ""nice"" to slut shame a 9 year old for her pajamas. It's not ""nice"" to abandon your kids when your wife gets in ""one of her moods"" and then pretend like nothing ever happened. 

I've gone almost 2 years no contact with my mom, while staying in touch for the occasional ""how are you"" text to my dad. I finally today blocked my dad. It took me 29 years to learn what boundaries are, how to be good to my inner child, and get the inner strength to block my mom. Now, it's my dad's turn. The cycle is this: I calmly laid out the abuse i went through and stated my boundaries- that i would need an apology to ever be around my mom again. Despite saying this for over 2 years, my dad will text me every 4 months saying ""hey we miss yall, when can we meet up?"" as if I never said anything. Then I repeat what I say each time, because I have sympathy that he lost a son, because at least he doesn't send my nervous system in fight or flight, that he's also a victim of my mom, etc. 

Today he messaged me to try to meet up for my birthday asking when ""We"" can meet up for MY birthday and i was done repeating myself. I was done of being told my voice is ignored and doesn't matter. It took me a long time to fully feel (not only logically know), that this is not right. Yes, I blocked my abuser, but if i tell you abuse i went through, and you ignore it, that's saying it's okay to harm me. It's telling me my needs are not important, that my voice doesn't matter. I have nieces that I could not fathom treating the way my parents have treated me. If she came up to me and told me someone abused her consistently, I would not be okay with that person nor force her to be around that person. Having been treated like this, I spent most of my 20s being treated like garbage by friends and romantic partners because i was taught my needs don't matter nor my voice.

I am always drawn to this sub through people's stories. I always feel like I can relate to how they feel of escaping or at least wanting to. Yet I don't even know if my parents can be considered narcissists or they are just plain selfish assholes, but I need a place to vent.

I'm almost out and getting away from my parents. A few months ago, I accepted a job offer in another state and I'll be moving. I am excited and sad at the same time, but I know I really need to get away for a while. These past fours years have been the most frustrating years I've spent since junior high. I've spent the recent years feeling lonely and wanting to spend the least amount of time in my parents place as possible. I only recently realized why I felt so lonely. A family friend (FF) came by recently to speak with one of my parents (P1) and I shared the news that I was moving away. FF was happy for me until I mentioned that the other parent (P2) doesn't know yet. When FF asked why, I explained that P2 had a habit of posting everything to FB without consent and despite me telling them several times not to post anything about me due to the nature of my work. FF and P1 kept cutting me off telling me that P2 was a good parent and that they deserved to know and to just tell them not to post it to FB. I was getting angry over the fact that they kept cutting me off like my own feelings didn't matter to them. P1 and I got into a screaming match in front of FF. This isn't anything new. P1 and I have been fighting over this for months. Its really ruining the experience of finally getting out and I'm no longer excited for it.

Reflecting over that situation made me realize that no one supports me in this circle. Not P1, not family friends, and not the extended family (with few exceptions).

I am 51 , my mother was 89.
I have been living with AIDS for 31, which provides context. I am trying to figure out if she was a narcissist.

 I could not sleep last night because its like i am finally facing down the damage she did and trying to reconcile it. I had to keep it all pushed down in order to try to do the right things and be a a good daughter.  Some of the many many things that stick out

The time 20 years ago  when my mother was still pretty healthy and she, with no self awareness at all, told me i had no idea what it was like to worry about my health all the time

THE time when, AIDS meds had just come out and i had just started on them she sent me a letter saying that i had gained some weight and my husband would leave me if i got fatter

The mornings when i was a teen and she would scream and yell at me and call me a Horse’s ass, which was her favorite thing to call me. The when i would look upset she would make fun of me and say that i looked like a scared rabbit

My mother got pregnant with me at 38. People told her she should have an abortion. She loved to tell me how people wanted her to abort me and wasnt i glad she didn’t abort me.

All the times when i was a teen when she said that i must be a “tart” and all the times she told me i would end up spending my life working at McDonalds

When  my husband had his aortic dissection and was terribly deathly ill and my mother had slow moving cancer and she told me she was mad because he “stole her Thunder” She was upset because not all of the attention would go to her
 
When i was a teen and got conjunctivitis and she decided i was a drug addict, spent 2 weeks berating me and and saying, “if it wasnt true you wouldnt be upset”. She then called in my brother the cop to lecture me. Finally she realized something was medically wrong and took me to an eye doctor. She never acknowledged her mistake

When she was terribly angry with me and told me i was a terrible person because I could not have her recover at my house after kidney surgery. I could not because i had 3 kids at home and would have had to give her my bedroom, at the same exact time as my husband was being released from 2 months in the hospital for and Aortic dissection and was literally bedridden

The allotment i sent her for years while in the marines, that was never acknowledged.
 
The fact that for decades, while raising 3 kids on a small budget I gave her a monthly stipend on top of paying her electric, cable and phone bill. Then despite my husband and i both having health issues but we had her come live with us for her final 4 years only to be called, irresponsible, selfish, rude, and a thief who made her feel like a prisoner.

I started working at 14 because we we’re poor and half of what i earned went to my mother to pay the bills. That was a lot of pressure on a teen. I dont begrudge this because it was needed . But it makes it hurt when she talks about how bad i am or fails to acknowledge the things we kids have done for her.

  The realization that out of 4 kids, I was probably treated the best. That at least 2 out of the 3 had way worse things said and done to them

For never, not once in my entire life feeling like my mother was someone i could go to to talk to about my own problems or issues because, everything was always about her. I never ever felt like i had a mother who was there for me in any way, In fact, i always felt nervous and literally scared when she was around.

 That she made sure, even in her last months, when i visited her in rehab every day that I knew where the notebook was because she wanted to make sure that I read it. She wanted to make sure we all knew how awful she thought we all were
 
 My niece died on New years of 2018. That morning my mother sent me a message berating me for not being friendly enough to her and for not saying Happy New Years. I Did not say Happy New Years to my mother literally hours after my niece died while plans were being made to remove life support, She in that same message said she gave up everything to move here, like she was doing ME a favor when she moved in.She does not say one word about my niece, her oldest grandchild , in that message. 

I was walking around target yesterday to get a birthday card for my sister and i was checking the back to see if they were Hallmark cards. Why? Because god forbid you got my mother a card that wasn’t Hallmark then there would be hell to pay.
 
The fact that i look at this list and think, maybe this is normal? Maybe this is not so bad? Maybe I am making a big deal out of normal small things?

I always knew that. She got on and off the wagon a few times in my late childhood. Sometimes her sobriety was blissful. Sometimes it was nothing but tension and anger. The drinking was ALWAYS awful, though. In my early adulthood, I had to escort her out of a bar (in her pajamas) for assaulting a security guard, I've had to answer police calls because she was getting a dui in the middle of the night, I've attended many ""family days"" at rehab. Almost 10 years ago, I quit drinking myself. I had my own run-ins with the law and quit at age 25. I'm so lucky to have this much sober time. 

My mom and I were incredibly close when I was young. It makes sense now, that I can see her narcissistic tendencies, why we were so close, and that that closeness served her and her alone. 

Shortly after my son was born, my mom fell off the wagon HARD. A night of drinking ended up with her yelling in the street, having to be pulled inside (kicking and screaming) by her husband and my brother. I have not spoken to or seen her since that night. 

When I had a baby 4 years ago, my mother was not involved with my pregnancy. I made it clear early on that this was MY pregnancy, and she doesn't tend to find interest in things that don't surround her. My baby shower was hosted by friends. My mom refused to hold the baby the first few times she met him. Even before she started drinking again, she was incredibly disinterested in my child. If she came to see him and he didn't give her a big smile, she'd insist ""he's just not acting like himself today"" (ma'am... he's 12 weeks old). 

I'm not quite sure what kind of advice I'm looking for in this forum. Part of me is certain I don't want to talk to her again. Part of me wants to talk to her, just to tell her how disappointing this has been. She has not reached out to me. She won't. I'm sure she's positive she hasn't done anything wrong.

My child is her only grandchild. She has never seen him walk or talk. She's never heard his voice. I want to think that her missing that is ""enough of a punishment"", but I want to fucking scream at her sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, long time sufferer, first time poster. Some general background, I am in my late 20's and grew up with two nparents (different flavors of narcissism) who divorced when I was in my teens.  My mom thinks everything is about her, which means she is easily offended by words and actions.  When my parents divorced, she was left in a really difficult financial situation and she made a lot of sacrifices for us for which I will be eternally grateful but she never misses an opportunity to bring up her sacrifices and lord them over us. 

  
 We have gone long periods (months) without talking to each other on two occasions, but have never explicitly addressed the issue because I know she won't take it well.  I always end up going back to her.  I have two younger siblings, siblingOne who recently moved out to live with their partner, and siblingTwo who still lives at home while they finish their degree.  They also fight with her often due to her behavior.  I have lived in a different state for the past few years which has made our relationship better because she can't involve herself in my life so much,  but I will be moving back to our home state soon so I really need to establish this boundary.  


I recently just had an experience (which I will outline below) that was so outrageous and hurtful that I know I need to put my foot down.  I've been going back and forth between crying and feeling bemused by her absurdity all day.  I will be having kids within the next few years and if I wait until that happens I know I won't have the emotional energy to do it.  I don't want to risk her treating them the way she treats me.  I want to send her an email (so she can't twist my words) telling her that her actions and attitudes have hurt her children, and she needs to finally accept that fact and work on improving her behavior or we cannot have a relationship.  I want to recommend therapy as a tool.  I want her to know that I love her very much but she has been hurting me my entire life and I can't take it any more or allow the same to happen to my future children.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, the most recent event: siblingOne invited my mom, siblingTwo, and me to vacation with their partner's family in a gorgeous tropical paradise.  This is important to remember, because it means we were siblingOne's GUESTS.  My partner was invited as well but wasn't able to come due to work.  My home state is a big travel hub, so for both the arrival and departure, I had a connection in my home state and shared a leg of travel with my mother and siblings.  We coordinated to ensure that we were on the same flights and sitting together.  There were many behavioral things that stood out to me during the trip, and I tried to correct her in a gentle and private manner on a few of them (while letting others slide because I didn't want to deal with her reaction).  Every time I did, she'd get offended.  


1. She could not handle us occasionally having separate sibling time/younger folks time, even when siblingOne's partner's parents tried to plan separate ""parent"" activites, she would avoid and sabotage the ""kids"" instead.  If she felt like we were ""excluding her"" by not involving her in every second of the day, she would try to insert herself.  Sometimes, her strategy to insert herself is to chime in with a negative comment about one of us (your hair looks bad, that dress is too small, you have a zit on your face, etc).  In these cases, I'd tell her ""hey, we are having a conversation/sibling time here.""
2. She was constantly weird about money.  We were guests and our hosts kept inviting us to things and paying without ever mentioning costs.  This made her uncomfortable and she'd start up awkward money conversations with our hosts which very visibly made THEM uncomfortable.  I tried telling her in private to relax about ""repaying"" them, they aren't asking us to pay, and if she can't relax she should have an explicit, private conversation with our hosts to say ""hey, I want to make sure I'm not taking advantage of your hospitality!  Can I split the cost of the things you've paid for?"" and then she'd know and could stop worrying.  She never did this, but she did stop asking about money.  Instead she pivoted to offering to pay for things in advance and even inviting them on a fancy excursion which was a great idea EXCEPT:
3. After she offered to invite them on this outing and they accepted, she made it a point to let them know that she set it up and it was costing $XXX, but of course not to worry about it because we were paying for it.
4. She was constantly putting down and nagging siblingOne.  On one specific occasion they were late for dinner, held up by a storm, and arrived very hungry and stressed. My mom instantly started telling them WHAT to eat and HOW to eat it.  Down to ""cut it in half, put it on your plate, use a fork..."".  SiblingOne was visibly distressed and I told my mom ""Hey, they know how to eat.  They seem very stressed, why don't you stop telling them how to eat."".  So she stopped telling them how to eat, only instead to start loudly commenting to the rest of the table about how they were eating wrong.  Again, I asked her to leave siblingOne alone.  In the cases where I had to ask her to behave in front of our hosts, I used our native language (which they do not speak) to avoid embarrassing her. 
5. She has no respect for personal boundaries. Exhibit A, I have started journaling again (stopped in highschool because I found out she was reading my diary), and I wanted to not slack on journaling while on this trip.  Sometimes this meant I had to do it in front of her and she kept asking me to show her.  I said no.  She asks why.  I said it's for me.  She got offended.
6. Exhibit B, siblingOne had to purchase a swimsuit while we were out because they didn't realize there would be a beach there. There weren't a lot of options so they ended up with a much more revealing style than they were comfortable with and they were shy and embarrassed about it.  My mother and I were walking behind siblingOne, and she asked me to sneakily take a photo of their butt (I am ""the photographer"").  I said no.  My mom started to complain and ask me why I wouldn't do it for her.  I told her I wouldn't do it because I know it would make siblingOne uncomfortable and I respect their boundaries, but if she wanted to go ahead and betray siblingOne's trust, she could go ahead.  That earned me an exasperated ""oh my god, pretend I didn't say anything!!!"" which is typical for her.  She crosses a line and then either denies having crossed it or asks us to pretend it didn't happen.  She disrespects siblingOne's comfort so often that they do not like my mother photographing them at all.
7. Related to Exhibit B, at a later point we were at a beautiful beach, and I asked siblingOne if I could photograph them.  I tried to do this without my mother noticing or being involved.  They were so happy and comfortable posing in front of the camera, but eventually my mom saw and walked up and loudly complained that siblingOne would never let her take photos of them, so that siblingOne would hear and of course they immediately withdrew and became uncomfortable.
8. At the airport waiting to depart, some paramedics approached a woman sitting near us to tell her she couldn't travel (something about the fact that while she was now covid negative, it has been too soon after her last positive test).  We had been sitting near this woman for 20 minutes already, so if there was a risk of exposure, the damage had been done.  My mother decided to very dramatically lean away from the woman (and into my seat), doing nothing other than making a scene considering that moving 3"" further away wasn't going to make her any safer.  So I told her ""hey, stop leaning into my seat"".  She got angry and told me to stop being so rude,  and I should let her lean.  I said she wasn't any safer leaning and was just calling attention to herself, and if she feels unsafe she should move to an empty seat farther away.  She responded that she was there first, so I said ""fine, take my chair then"" and I got up to move farther away so she could have my seat.  This, apparently, was the last straw of perceived disrespect for her. (there was a lot more that happened on the trip but this is already long enough as is)

So, as we boarded our flight, I chatted with her a bit, or at least I thought I did, but she wasn't really engaging with me.  We were in the same row on the flight, but siblingTwo was between us, so we didn't interact during the flight.  When we landed in our home city, my mom rushed off the plane before most people had even stood up from their seats, and she dragged siblingTwo off with her.  SiblingOne, their partner, and I, didn't manage to get off the plane for another several minutes.  We expected to see them waiting for us at the gate, but instead they were rushing down the hallway towards Customs.  It has been years since I've come through my home city on an international flight, so what I didn't know at that time was that we would have to split up at customs, as there are different lines for connections and final destination arrivals.  We were confused why they weren't waiting, so we ran after them.  Eventually we reached the point where I had to split off and my mom (looking very unhappy) and siblingTwo were standing there waiting.  I said my goodbyes and made the rounds hugging everyone, prioritizing my mom, but she was very cold and her face and body language made it clear that she did not want to hug me and she didn't make an effort to return the hug.  I went my separate way.

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later, I learned from siblingOne that once they were in their line, my mom had a ""dramatic moment"" saying we ruined the vacation for her, because ""we acted like she couldn't do anything right and only (partner's) parents were the good part"" and she said ""I should never go on vacation with my children again"".  Fortunately it seemed like siblingOne wasn't too bothered by the display but felt awkward since this was in front of their partner, and they knew that nothing they could say that wasn't a complete lie would make her happy.  They pointed out that this vacation is not unique and these sorts of disagreements have always arisen on past vacations together and ignored her further complaints.  So I apologized to siblingOne that they had to deal with that without me there but I was glad that they weren't letting our mother get what she wanted (which was to try and spoil their trip in the way she felt it had been spoiled for her).  We lamented that she was so dramatic but I wasn't too upset about it until today.  


This morning, I reached out to siblingTwo, because they live with her and I know how our mother can be: persistent and relentless.  I worried that they would become the target for her unhappiness since they were alone with her.  SiblingTwo told me they were fine, and that they were refusing to talk about about the issue with her because she was being ridiculous.  That's when they told me that she was ""hyper fixated on what you did"" (ie, telling her not to lean into my seat) and that she said ""OP doesn't care about us"" and that she **tried to rush through the separation point at customs to avoid saying goodbye**.  SiblingTwo argued with her that she was being ridiculous and forced her to stop and wait for me.  They asked me to let siblingOne know about this, since they hadn't talked about it yet and was exhausted from dealing with our mom.  So that was why she ran off the plane and didn't wait, because she felt so slighted by me giving her a social correction that she wanted to leave without saying goodbye.  And when siblingTwo tried to make her stop, she said that I don't care about them.  


The fact that she could say that I don't care, after all the behavior from her that I put up with and forgive, and all the uncomfortable things I've done to make her happy... I can't believe it.  Last January her father died in her home country, and I dropped everything on a dime to purchase an expensive flight to be there for her and help her sort out the funeral because no one else would.  She asked me to do the eulogy at his service because she didn't have the strength and I wrote and delivered it.  She even BRAGGED about my beautiful eulogy and how much I helped her on this very same trip, only to turn around and tell siblingTwo that **I don't care about them**.  And to top it all off is the absolutely outrageous behavior of trying to run away in the airport to avoid saying goodbye.  I feel like there are very few, if any, things a person could do to deserve being abandoned by a travel companion like that.  Especially a mother to their own child.  It's such a crazy thing to do that I honestly find the behavior concerning, but not more so than I am hurt by it.    


So that's the long and short of it.  I want to send an email, addressing her trying to run away and talking shit about me to my siblings.  I want to address her behavior and how it affects me.  And I want to tell her she needs to change her behavior (ideally by seeking professional help) or we cannot have a relationship because she has hurt me too many times and I can't keep that energy in my life.  I myself will be seeking therapy to talk through the damage she and my father have done because I clearly have a lot to unpack!  But I need to set this boundary NOW and I have no idea what the best way to write it will be.  I am giving my siblings a heads up about this, especially siblingTwo since they live with her, and letting them know that they can stay out of it if they are most comfortable that way and in that case, if she tries to bring it up to them (she will) they can absolutely say they don't want to talk about me with her and to stay firm.  I worry most for siblingTwo in this scenario.

I go to to events that my dad asks to me, even though she is his plus one. My Nmom has a few good moments… but her narrasistic tendency always shine through even on her best behavior.

My husband and I recently got a new 5month old rescue. We have an older 3 year old puppy and we wanted to get her a sibling. My 3 year old was extremely abused the first 2 years of her life. She doesn’t really trust other humans and keeps to her self more. This drives my nmom NUTS! It’s brings so me so joy when my sweet baby gives her the cold shoulder and won’t cuddle my nmom. Nmom even whines about it and starts pouting about how the dog is mean and rude and we need to work on socializing her. *eyeroll

The 5month old has never met a bad human in his life and will go up to anyone for pets. We are working on personal space at home, which he is struggling to get. Nmom has met him and is obsessed with him. When walking the dogs she always grabs for his leash. If he is walking around, she will pull him into her lap. The puppy isn’t particularly comfy in her lap, but he accepts the attention and so nmom thinks she has a special connection with him. Mind you she never offers to walk the older dog and has completely stop giving the older dog attention since the puppy has arrived. Which is totally fine because dad adores her and gives her the space she needs to be the loving baby she is. In fact, my dad is one of the few human out side of her parents she will actually asks for cuddles from. The little kicker to all this?

I say some trauma that she has done to me in my past and she immediately says “I didn’t do that” “I don’t remember that”. So it’s like… instead of taking the person’s word for it… your child… that they have the memory… you just deny them any consoling or apologizing? Like it doesn’t matter that you don’t remember it??? You did it and now I have ptsd and a bunch of other issues?? Like my issues didn’t pop out of no where. And as soon as I say my trauma she has to come back with “well you were a bad kid so that’s what happened”. 

But it’s not even with the past my mom does this, she does it mid-conversation. She will say something and I’ll ask for clarification of what she said, or repeat exactly what she said back to her and she will be like “I didn’t say that!” “That’s not what I said!” Then it will go into an argument of how my perceptions of her are wrong (she is into life coaching) and I’m seeing her through a filter of my past. But whenever she says something about me it’s the truth and I can’t deny it and it’s not a filter. But then when I tell her she denies my truth, she says that of course what she said about me was through her filter. And it’s just this huge back and forth about what she says and what she didn’t say and something that was true five seconds ago isn’t true more and no amount of talking it though will ever work. She will just deny deny deny everything I say and then be confused why I’m still upset.

I could even Name them, sometimes, with caveats, with a guilty little feeling, like I’m taking away from the „real“ victims. But recently, something changed. I can say that. I can name it all, and I just named it all in once like I started to these last few days, and I had to share it here, because I had to put it somewhere:

I was abused. I was emotionally abused. I am traumatised because he abused me emotionally. He is still terrorising me, threatening me, guilting me. I deserved none of this, and i deserved better, in fact. I should have learned unconditional love, and I was owed a chance to develop my own personality. I didn’t get any of this. I don’t know my own strengths realistically, I am afraid of the world and myself, and i am hobbled because I am traumatised because he is an abusive dipshit. And none of this should have happened to me. He had no right to do that.



I just, suddenly, managed to accept all that. No caveats. No excusing his behaviour, not even mentioning other people, or his other victims, or any positives, just. Acknowledging that he wronged me. And I cried a bit at that and I was angry and it felt good, in a weird way, to give all that a name. I don’t have to talk around it. He was wrong, he harmed me, there is ni excuse for what he did to me, and his feels like maybe I’m getting to this point of „grieving for the childhood you didn’t have“, but I am definitely getting to the point of „I **deserve** better“, not just „I need to leave to leave to function“, and that’s a relief even in the grief .",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713642,public,self,Finally accepting it as abuse,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p7nk2c/finally_accepting_it_as_abuse/,some_ads,7,progressupdate,b0d07a64-82c9-11e3-9340-22000aa47206,[Progress],,,,,,,,,,

His wife, who I can call as my mother, and has been always there for both of us. NMom is still the same and I will never be in contact with her.

When I was graduating from high school (I still had a year left but was preparing for it), my dad wanted to start studying in high school as well since he didn't graduate from high school back in the days. He even got much better numbers than I got lol

When I started studying bachelor of business administration (here it is a tradenom), dad saw how much I liked studying even though there was a rough road in the first place (I had to take a longer way to the university + Covid).

He started making small games, he got promoted on his workplace, and now he is going to study in open university as bachelor of business adminstration.

So I'm posting here because my parents have toxic tendencies, including most probably narcissism.
For the past year I've kept telling my mom I wanted to move out to be closer to university when school starts. I've said a bunch of other reasons too, but I've never said anything about leaving because of them.
A month and a half ago I brought the subject up again, and she refused to acknowledge it completely. 

But that didn't stop me from still planning my move, signing a lease for September, etc. Four days ago I told her again that I wanted to move and it was scandalous. She said horrible things to me like I'm incapable of doing anything on my own, that I hate them and the rest of the family, that I'm ungrateful, that I have no rights and that she wants me home where she can know everything I do. Among all her crying, she also said that she doesn't think I'll ever speak to her again if I move, and that she forbade me to move. Didn't understand why I ""didn't understand"" why moving wasn't allowed.... And that if I leave, she wants this year's tuition money back. 
I didn't even have the chance to tell her that I signed a lease, so I believe she thinks she won this round. She barely talked to me since then, only this morning did she say something remotely nice. There's still some tension in the air I think, she probably has a feeling something is up. 

My moving date is on Wednesday. If I tell her the day before that I'm leaving no matter what she says, it'll create scandals and I won't be allowed to take furniture, etc. Even though it's an option, it's a lot of hassle so I was thinking of just leaving while my parents are at work and be able to keep my furniture. I'd leave them a letter explaining the same thing that I've explained before, and that I'm certain that I'm ready and that I hope eventually my mom will understand. 

Also adding that we should not communicate for a while (except maybe email) and that afterwards we could think about doing calls and visits. Obviously I'll block my parents and family friends everywhere, so no one will be able to guilt me or say some nasty things. 

As for the moving, I've already packed and moved most of my belongings. I only have 2 boxes and furniture left to take. We have a 2h window on Wednesday to move 10 pieces and undo my bedframe. Since we'll be 7 people, I think it might be doable? Having 2 people load up the truck, 2 people on the bedframe, and 3 people moving the rest of the things/ helping me pack the last two boxes. 

I'm still hella worried though, because what if one parent stays home that day, or comes home early. And what's my mom gonna do? She's unpredictable. I changed shifts at work so in case she hunts me down, I won't work my usual. And everyone will be safe at work. And then what? I take a loan for school, no biggie. But then what if I can't live with roommates? It's my first time. And what if my mom never speaks to me again (quite ironic because that's one of her biggest fears).

It's in the top 2 biggest things I've ever done in my life, but I don't feel much about it. Except that I'm goddamn fearful of the unknown.

But I had no outside support (lost contact with all my high school and college friends) and no money saved up. So I stayed with them after knowing what they did was wrong. Here is a list:

* **Lied about my college arrangements.** Moved to a different state. I ended up losing my car, my computer, my video games, lost the chance to be with the girl I was in love with, and I burned through my $5,000 saved up because of their lies and broken promises. After staying in a dorm for a year, they broke their promise of allowing me to stay in an apartment and sent me back to the dorms. This was all done on purpose to control me! I soon became depressed and dropped out...
* **Kicked me out of the house and made me homeless** (unless I begged for forgiveness). After a road trip thinking about things, I confronted my mother in a kind, reasonable way saying: **""You know, you've always acted like there was something wrong with me. But I was never broken inside, I was fine the way I was.""** She then starts to scream at me like a crazy person and demands my house keys and says I'm no longer allowed in the house. So I took another long road trip from Arizona to Florida. I ended up living with my grandpa in Texas and working for my aunt for a bit and my grandpa ended up driving me back to my parents. We never talked about that day.
* **Constantly locates me with my phones and lies about it.** About 10-15 years ago, Sprint had the family locator program. Since I was on their plan I would get a text message saying, ""You have just been located."" When I confronted my parents about it they said: ""They just randomly send those to you."" It doesn't matter how admit I am about the fact they JUST locating me, they give the same answer that they didn't. Honestly, I think this hurts the most. How can you treat someone like they're that stupid? Even when I started to pay for my own plan, somehow I still that message when I left to Vegas without telling them.
* **Pretended some girl who liked me (who I didn't like) was my girlfriend to the rest of the family.** I was in church and 16, my mother introduced some girl to my grandma like she was my girlfriend. I even told my mother not to do this. The girl even played along. I didn't want to cause a scene in front of my grandma, so I was just quiet. I was thinking to myself ""What the h$ll is going on here?""
* **When I told them I was getting treated badly at my career job, they told me to ignore it and just work there for 10 years cause I would make a lot money.** I think anyone who cared would tell you to find work somewhere else.  I worked 10 various hourly jobs before that, so it wasn't just employees giving me a hard time, I'm familiar with that. This was straight up abuse.
* **When my brother was stealing my food, clothes, and $100 bills out of my wallet, they wouldn't confront him about it.** They said you have no evidence so they wouldn't confront him. When I confronted him about it, he physically assaulted me. I called the cops and had him arrested. Then everyone in the family took his side.
* **When I confront them about the past, they either won't apologize or say they don't remember and say ""that's in the past"" and to ""get over it.""**

I was a straight-A student who my teachers and peers liked. I did all the extracurriculars and was accepted to all the colleges I applied to. So why the h$ll would you start doing this to your son?!?

(I guess it was a control thing since they could no longer legally tell me what to do once I was 18 and going to college. That and a reputation thing since I was quiet. I feel like quiet to them equaled being less than everyone else as you're supposed to be perfect in every aspect including being extremely outgoing. And also a reputation thing that I didn't have a girlfriend yet despite having fallen in love with a girl in my hometown that my parents moved away from.)

This is the real problem: **I can't stop thinking about this stuff!**

I wish I could move on but I can't. Unfortunately, I stayed with them for the last 10 years and drowned myself in self-help to avoid the truth of my situation.

Actually, it's been 20 years (18-year-old going to college to now a soon-to-be 38-year-old) since they started to treat me this way. (28 is when I gave up on my career job and started to study and write self-help and when I considered just leaving the whole situation.)  **For the most part, the way they treated me came out of NOWHERE! I think that's why it hit me so hard and why I've been trying to fix the relationship.**

And it seems like people in general are angry at me for staying with my parents and not working. I think that's also why I became a TI. (I feel like that's an entirely different situation, but I also feel like it's worth mentioning.)  I hate myself for staying there.

I need to move on, but the only way I can think to do that is to cut them out of my life.

So I have two options:

1. **Work while living with them and slowly move away**
2. **Just leave with what little I've got**

The problem is: **I've kind of tried both options already.**

For number one, I finally got my dream job while living with them. But every weekend when I had nothing to do and no one to hang out with besides my parents, I felt extremely empty inside. The job was ultimately unfulfilling because of that, and I ended up leaving. Then I ""joined"" the self-help world/industry which does seem to fill the void to a point. But I think it was just escapism from my real problems.

For number two, I've ""ran away from home"" several times, several different ways since I was 28. I just never had that much money saved up when I did it. (Never had more than that $5,000 saved up since college. I think my unhappiness causes me to spend money on things.)

I used my car to sleep in while I went to California probably 10 times. Couldn't get used to it. Tried to bike across the county three times and then tried walking across it twice. Gave up and went home every single time. Stayed a week at a Nevada hotel and at a California hotel to start my life over. Didn't work out. I can't think of all the ways, but I've always gave up and came home.

I really don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm just out of an abusive 3-year narc relationship with my other grandpa (went back and forth between living with him and my parents, thought he was my ticket out of there, no idea he was also a narc till 2 years into it) but now I'm permanently back here with my parents.

**What should I do now?**

**P.S.** I think part of the problem is I do get along with my parents 90% to 99% of the time. My mom and I are pretty good friends. My dad and I are very much alike so I can relate to him.

The story gets even more spicy, cause I called her employee a pedophile in my private convo that was stolen and published. Well, technically he might not be a pedophile; he is simply dating a 17yo girl being a 35yo man that has a fetish of having sex with people that wear diapers and act like they're toddlers. I wouldn't call him a pedo publicly, despite that I do not support such behavior, especially when an underage is involved.

A while back I told both of my parents that I was planning on moving out when I had enough money for it to be a safe decision. At first, my mother blew up on me and told me that I was an awful and immoral person for doing that to her and that I should instead stay with her in her trailer to pay her bills. Her house is falling apart and it's never been the best place to live, so I was super resistant to that idea. I posted about that whole mess here a while back and thanks to some kind users i know realize just how strange it is. So, flash forward, I'm staying with my dad now but things aren't much better to be frank.  I simply don't have much of a life here as my dad expects me to be home whenever I can. Even then, it's hard for me to do much as he gets upset with me whenever I'm in my room alone. With all of that being said, I desperately want to move out and be an independent adult. However, my dad told me that he wants me to stay ""for at least a year"" or stay with him indefinitely. I fear that both of my parents are going to blow up on me should I decide to move out and it's so hard to gain the courage to ""just leave.""

Second: I’m on the phone, so sorry about the formatting.

In my country, it’s quite usual to throw your kids out of the house as soon as they turn 18 or finish high school, but my mother is… complicated. She doesn’t want me to go away. It sounds sweet at first, but she actually doesn’t want me to “get out of her sightings”, as she puts it. 

I’ve been controlled my whole life. I’ve been told that all people are evil and that they will hurt me if I walk alone, even during daytime and even living in a tiny city with very low criminality rates. I’ve been told that I can’t do anything on my own. I’ve been told that I need my mother to approve everything and everyone I surround myself with. I’ve been told I’m stupid and I would never be able to survive on my own. It’s a mess.

But I’m moving out in a few months. It was very hard and painful to argue with my mother about it, but she agreed to “let me go away” for a higher education in another city. I’m not sad about it! The opposite! I couldn’t be happier, but I’m also scared! I’m moving to a huge city and I don’t know if I’ll be able to thrive. I know almost anything would be better than the situation here with my mom, but I’m terrified of people and “the outside world”. 

Also, I wouldn’t be escaping my mother properly, as she refuses to give me the money I need (even for food) if I do anything she doesn’t agree with. Any tips on what to do?

My Nparent is (reasonably) fearful of being mandated to work in-person at a 50k-person government workplace where masking is not mandated, testing is voluntary, and everything is self-reported. I support their decision to not work there, for sure. However, something really hit me hard about the lengths they went to try and not have to go to work in person. First, some background though because otherwise it's a stupid situation but not as ""Nparent"" in quality.



I've had severe depression and anxiety since I was a tween, related to struggling through school as someone with an undiagnosed learning disability with no support or access to help, a stressful home environment, and being faced with a lot of academic pressure as a high-achieving student. My parents and other adults in my life didn't notice anything was wrong, or do anything about it beyond chastising me for being ""gross"" or ""crazy."" I was so depressed that I left a pile of stuff on the floor that my ailing cat peed on for months, was scared of telling my parents that the toilet got clogged again so I left the clogged toilet for two weeks until the smell got too bad (my parents used to blame me for having ""too big of poops and clogging the toilet"" as if I could control my fecal matter), my bed was entirely covered in stuff so I had a sliver of room to sleep etc. It was really really bad.



I couldn't access therapy until the end of college, when my enabler parent agreed to cover the cost of therapy after I couldn't get out of bed for two weeks. Enabler parent found me crying in bed and came to comfort me, while Nparent made disparaging remarks and guilted me for being depressed, treating the s*icidal ideation I was experiencing as the attention-seeking lie of a dramatic teen. I'm in my 20s and have struggled for a decade. When I started therapy, Nparent made dismissive and judgmental remarks about ""every kid these days needing counseling."" 



As you can tell, this parent has never cared about my emotional or mental health, only my production of good value as an intelligent and successful person to boost their ego. They laugh at me when I cry out of frustration/sadness/being overwhelmed (since childhood), made fun of my weight and gaslighted me about it when I confronted them about how it made me feel (childhood onward and would still now if I wasn't thin), and have been tearing down all of my aspirations since I was an older teen, saying I'll never be successful unless I'm a doctor, engineer, or professor. It changes depending on Nparent's mood. Sorry for the long background but it stings even more because of this history. 



To avoid going to their workplace, Nparent went to therapy for two sessions, contacted a psychiatrist, and got a medical letter claiming an inability to work in person due to mental health. They claimed ""everyone should go to therapy,"" that it's great, and then told enabler parent and me about their therapy sessions. I was just... Laughing on the inside. I had no energy to be angry about this. They haven't gone to therapy since. But I'm still so... Miffed(?) that they used therapy for the manipulative gain, and then acted like they knew everything about therapy and it's values after two sessions. I'm disgusted.

Now she’s a textbook one but (luckly) not one that uses physical force. But she does always manipulate everyone and makes everyone feel really guilty, for example she said to my gf a few days ago that she doesn’t love her familly because gf asked if we could celebrate her brother’s birthday on a different day then the 28th (that isn’t his real birthday actually) because me and my gf wanted to celebrate our 2 year anniversary on that day (wich is actually the 28th) and her mother freaked out at her, sending almost a colplete book over whatsapp and even calling my gf at work.
her mother always plays really nice and acts like gf is making a problem out of everything and gf never seems to get in a word and always ends up losing the fight. 
this is only the most recent example. 
Now my gf is very emotionally damaged and i really want to help her in every way i can.
can anyone with experience help me find a way to help her and make her feel wanted and loved.
Also tips on how to deal with her mother would be very helpfull,

He's not a total narcissist, he has many narcissistic traits but I am lucky I can maintain a solid relationship with him when there have been times I would have gone no contact with him in a heartbeat. 

Still my stomach dropped when he couldn't get through the first page of the letter without a bit of cheeky parentification, some self victimisation and reminding me of everything he's sacrificed and that he views where I am now as a failure and a struggle.

It was so nice at first, but it just had to take a turn.

""Sorry if this upsets you, but I'm your dad, will always be your dad and it's not unreasonable for a dad to ask that time and again""

I resent many of his word choices, I try and read them from his perspective as an honest articulation of his feelings and thoughts, because god knows where else he's putting shit that honest out there, there are things he tells me he says he can't even tell his own wife.

I just wish he could talk about this ""come home"" shit just once and also acknowledge any of the reasons I left. It's not unreasonable to ask, but it's unreasonable not to make an effort where I've said it counts. 

Many things have changed in the past 4 years, but that 14 year old kid he told to leave, he told would never be called by his real name, then flipped his script and begged to come home knows that when he came back, nothing was really all that different. Fast forward to when I'm 16, I explained very clearly. I explained why I was moving out, my reasons, in depth. I was transparent with them, I gave them weeks of notice after months of telling them I was planning on moving out at said time. They gave me a bombardment of vicious messages 24 hours before I got picked up with my stuff, my parents stonewalled me for a bit after I moved. The only person who accepted my ""No, I'm sorry but it's not that simple. I can't just stay."" and saw me off was my younger sister.

Does he think about my conditions, when he talks of the conditions of my return? They're the same as they were when I was 14. I'll come back when you go to therapy. Each year, at every opportunity I beg. ""I've seen enough therapists"" he says, not one of them being for his own issues except a short lived attempt at marriage counseling that he and my mother stopped once she suggested divorce. In fact part of why I moved out in the first place was to freely seek out therapy, something he had always sought to control to make sure no one was ""encouraging her confusing."" 

When I moved schools, ""(s)he can't see the counselor or join any programs without me being informed."" 

When he found a letter referring me to an endocrinologist from our family doctor he took it without my permission and hid it in his wardrobe. 

I had been without psychological or regular psychiatric support for more than a year, an untreated BPD diagnosis that exploded under the pressure of that environment, and an attendance rate that was so low my father was getting warning letters that legal action may be taken against him. Every single meeting, I told my teachers I needed therapy. My dad told them he'd arrange it. I'd follow up on it. Nothing. Nothing since I refused to see do a program based on family therapy when I had my own psychological needs I was focused on, and that program didn't match them. ""I gave you the chance, you didn't want it""

I just feel so fucking unseen. God, what the fuck has all my honesty been for if he's just gonna fucking cry alone about it in his car. I have celebrated so many achievements since I moved out, moving out has been my greatest accomplishment. Everything I've done since I moved out, each success, he does not celebrate the way he honours my ""failures"" with his tears.

I just wish they'd come over more. We're in lockdown right now so they can't, but my mother has never even seen my place most likely because she's not allowed to use his car or under his instructions, the car he bought for my sisters. My oldest sister has driven me home a couple of times but she's never even seen the place. I want them to see how it is, how nice we've made it, how proud I am. 

When did he forget?

When did he forget all the times he disappointed his father by honouring himself? Why can't he connect the dots and see he's projecting part of his unresolved issues with his father and fear of breaking social expectations onto me. 

Does his family even know I've moved out? 

Ah well. I know he pushes me away when he is panicked. He's scared he's lost me because he's lost his legal power over me. He fears I've been as strong in my convictions as he knew I was all along.

It is painful, but this is his version of love. This is what it looks like. I am so loved by him though, so loved. When I can break through his walls and we can laugh and talk and spend time with eachother it's so nice. Moving out has given me the power to back up my boundaries with consequence, I no longer have to put myself in situations I am not comfortable. One day we will love eachother more healthily.

Well, an absurd series of events finally forced my hand to go NC with my dad (thought I knew in my heart this nasty cycle wasn’t sustainable if my mom was using him to guilt trip me back). Anyway, in one of her prior nastier hoovering cycles, she decided to email my spouse, because she knew this wild violation of boundaries would guarantee a response from me, and precious supply for her. It has been a successful entry point for her in the past. She knows my husband and I are very transparent with one another and he will tell me that this has happened.

Well this time around, she’s upped her crazy. Now she’s tweeting at him with a new twitter account neither of knew she has, and stalking him on LinkedIn. The tweet, which came from a handle containing her full name, removing any doubt of its author, was the following:

“Dear ______, please call me. _____’s mom”

What. The. Fuck?!! 

Not her name, but my mom. As if I am pair of shoes or a purse.

Is this what the rest of her life is going to be? I shudder to think.

If you can relate, what has helped you to marginalize the real estate in your mind that your nparent occupies? I’m exhausted by it.

You might not be able able to escape from the narcissist, due  to either financial or logistical reasons. This is the source of most  of their power. This is a post on how to deal with them for the time  being for maximum gains.

What  I recommend is adopting a strategic approach when it comes to dealing  with them. Give them a false sense of security. It's okay to lose  battles if you eventually win the war. These battles or better yet,  losses, usually end up being having to abide by their ""rules"", deferring  to their authority, or giving them a feeling of control over us.  Nothing wrong with any of this if it will be beneficial to you in the  long run. I know it's silly, as if I'm telling you to not have  boundaries but I want you to look at it as trading space for time. Let  them think they are winning, when in reality you are secretly advancing,  in this case, working towards your independence.  According to Sun Tzu,  When you are weak, make your enemies think you are strong, when you are  strong, make them think you are weak, when you are in retreat make them  think you are advancing and when you are advancing, make them think you  are in retreat. The art of deception.

One  way to do this by not arguing with them; no displays of anger. I know  they can really piss one off but if they are in your presence under no  circumstance should you show that you are pissed off, because for one,  it achieves nothing and doesn't help you at all in your eventual goal of  escaping. Two, it lets them know what makes you tick, which is valuable  info to them for future purposes. Last but definitely not least,  arguing is taxing on your mental health.

Understand  that the narcissist wants you depressed and running in circles. They  will try to start petty battles all for the sake of mentally  exhausting/distracting you. Never justify yourself to them; if they  criticize something you did, ignore them, they are trying to get you to  explain yourself, as if you're somehow guilty of being human. They do  this to start arguments and also to maintain their ""holier than thou""  image, giving you the illusion that they themselves are perfect.

As  you know they have huge egos. You must exploit this whenever you can.  Give them the feeling of victory, that's all they live for after all.  Feed their ego by agreeing with them, asking for their opinion on  something (the news is good for this), dulling your talents or by giving  the appearance of finally devoting yourself to their cause, themselves.  It might be hard to do this, but the hardest things usually have the  best returns of investment in life. They will stop being hostile;  aggression is usually fueled by more aggression and when you stop giving  them fuel (which is why I must stress the importance of not engaging in  arguments with them, never show that you are angry), they will leave  you alone, giving you time and mental fortitude to plan your escape from  their toxic regime. There is no shame in surrendering to fight another  day. Better that than to be a martyr, pertaining to narcissistic  parents, this might mean being kicked out or being physically assaulted.  You might live in a democratic society but let us not fool ourselves,  narcissists are dictators. You are the country under a colony but on a  much smaller scale.

Another  instance where you might want to employ your cunning is whenever they  pester you with questions. Not all interrogators wear uniforms. Conceal  your intentions by giving them false information. If you say nothing at  all/are being secretive, it will alert them that you are on a defensive,  making them unpredictable, an undesirable outcome. I've seen people  mention grey rocking on here, based on my understanding, it involves  avoiding the narcissist or giving them very short responses. Take it  further by employing the strategy I just mentioned, remember, you want  them to think you are on their side.

Now  if you've done all of that successfully, the narcissist will leave you  alone. Suddenly you're not mentally drained from pointless arguments and  can now focus all your energy on making money. They say money can't buy  happiness but it definitely buys freedom, a prerequisite to happiness.  Develop a framework to start earning money. I must put emphasis on this,  focus on making money, it is the key to your independence. It could be a  job or selling whatever skill you might have, as long it makes you  money. Save aggressively. If you remember what I said about being  pestered with questions, you'll know to deflect with false information.  It might be impossible to conceal a job, but it's not hard to tell them  you're earning a figure much lower than the actual one. Money is power  in its purest form and will give you the ability to say ""fuck you"" to  anything in life, the ability to walk away.

I've  seen posts here that suggest moving out, which I agree with, moving out  should be priority number one but some of them fall short on the how.

I cried... a few weeks later we go to 6flags as a family and my moms now husband is trying to get my attention and by doing this he grabs me by my hair (2nd domestic encounter?), mind you he’s like 300 lbs and 6’7. .. I was eventually over it so as soon as I got home I packed and called my dad whom I never lived with and decided to go live with him.. now pause... my dad is in the military at this point, I only see him about 2x a year and when I did I’d meet a new woman everytime. I remember him not saying much really, I don’t have memories quite with him, but I do remember wanting to talk to him but never being able to get it out, I’d just cry for hours instead... I can recall a time he bought a house, me and my sister came to visit he stated the next time we come he will let us decorate.. I came to visit the 2nd time around and he had a lady and his 4 kids in the house with their room decorated. I had to share a bed with them... that hurt and I cried a lot... fast forward , I am moving with him now to a whole different state alone at 14.. this time around I move in with him,his new wife and 2 kids... it was weird to me how he could have a whole other family and just not even be able to talk to me... since I already didn’t know him well I remember constantly just sitting in my room and never coming out . I peed in a cup and washed clothes in my tub.. as I started high school I played sports and got along with people well... my freshman year my dad eventually got deployed so I had to stay with my new step mom, which cause me to rebel but nothing major. I’d just hang after school longer sometimes and not tell where I was at. My dad came back my sophomore year and I struggled with my grades which made him eventually angry. He took my phone and went through messages, he seen me and my friends messages. (We were really just being teens we cussed a little) he had an outburst and flipped my whole room which scared me and resulted me to want to go back home. (Mind you we still don’t have much of a relationship or talk, I figured he was just disciplining me as a parents). Moved back with mom, she bribed me with things to get me to stay. Eventually my grades weren’t up to par, my moms husband intervened and took my phone and told me I couldn’t contact my dad.. (when at this time I was supposed to go visit him for holidays) I eventually began to bump heads with my mom because she let him control not only me but her... I had to leave.... went back to live with dad.. he is now divorced.(never tells me why) but now I come back and my dad is single again so a lot of the times now I was resulted to being home alone my dad went out so I just eventually started to hang out with friends 24/7 and do my own thing and this was my senior year of highschool so I got some leeway... I remember one day getting a call while at school mentioning that my mom had been beaten my her husband.. i became very furious.. my mom didn’t leave and i gained some hatred towards her and stay away from her home for awhile...eventually after I graduate which is 2018.. I’m working and having fun and on the go and really my dad is to. We don’t ever see each other... this is our new normal. ( we did have sit down talks from time to time but they were like long life lectures nothing reasonable) I remember Jan 1 2019 I get a call from my sister saying that my mom has been beaten again and I grow angry and a lot of anger for her husband but she doesn’t leave... mind you this man has never apologized and my mom gets angry at us for being angry at him... I just become such an angry person... a little later , I began to date a guy who was emotionally unavailable and used me for sex, got me pregnant had an abortion, i paid for it alone, had nobody there for me not even the guy &amp; never told anybody... I feel because I had nobody he really comforted me, despite how he treated me. I continued to date him, pay for his stuff and everything. I was manipulated and didn’t know. Eventually I got tired and decided to leave but he continued to beg me to stay so I did. Later finding out he was having sex with 2 other girls and one also had an abortion . But that didn’t stop me I still dealt with him it was hard to let go... about a year later I ended up pregnant again and had another abortion and I just felt horrible and spiraled downhill.. my mental health dropped a lot , I stopped having motivation to work , became an alcoholic, used drugs, my self esteem was down, started losing friends, I looked for validation within men so much, I let them use me for my body thinking it was ok... I grew way more distant from my dad and angrier with him because he was right there but couldn’t even tell. I eventually became suicidal and started to confess it to my parents because I was scared and got sent to a mental hospital. Within that time I had therapy appointments but refused to go, had to take medicine but refused to take it because I was scared to become addicted... now I just am at an all time low.. my dad gets angry for me always staying in my room. And we start to bump heads to the point that we eventually got into a physical altercation...I take a break go to my moms for a week and I was very low and sad... I didn’t talk or eat I lost about 15+ in 1 month... her husband approaches me and asks why I don’t love him which results to me having an outburst throwing things &amp; explaining to him that he’s beaten my mom. He laughs in my face. &amp; my mom doesn’t do much. She just ask what did I do to help the situation... few months later aka now my dad kicks me out for a month until finding out I’ve been in a car accident and been sleeping in my car. He let me back in but now I’m just  really insecure , I’ve lost many friends, haven’t been able to maintain a job, and have so much still going on. It’s hard for me to because I’ve lost trust in a lot. In myself , I feel like I’ve became narcissistic or selfish or something. I’ve lost friends. My parents have never apologized to me about the abuse and a lot of stuff just has to get swept under the rug. I know this is long and This is not even it all, I’ve dealt with so much and now i don’t know how to deal with the real world, I am scared. my siblings go with the flow and I just can’t.

My 74m step-dad married my 56f mom and legally adopted 35f me when I was five, and it was probably the best thing that could have happened to me. 
My mom is a raging narcissist, but covers it pretty well in public, and just shows it privately to a few of us ""lucky"" family members, mainly my step-dad and myself. 
She cheated on my step-dad probably 25 years ago with my biological dad, and it was a mess. They separated, I hated it. Then she realized she was going to have to actually work if she didn't have financial support, so she went back to my step-dad. For a while there, she ""found Jesus"" and I think she mellowed out a little bit, but around her 50th birthday, something snapped, and she decided that she was going to do what she wanted, screw everyone else. She left my dad to run an extremely demanding business by himself at 70+ yrs old, while she visits ""best friends"" or ""works"" hours away, and I'm left to help him on my days off, after working all week.
This has been going on for years, and I'm done. She never suffers any consequences to her actions. I'm tired of running her business, while lying to my dad and pretending I don't know anything about the multiple affairs that she has had and then outright told me about. She thinks I empathize with her because she's ""bored.""
He deserves better than this, but I don't think I should have to be the one to tell him. He's almost 20 years older than she is, and I think he is afraid of being alone this late in life, but wouldn't you want to know? Wouldn't you rather be alone than with someone who cares nothing for you? How do I resolve this without putting myself directly in the middle of it?

This has been an issue pretty much my whole life, with her complete inability to accept responsibility, (even to my dad, as he revealed) or apologize even when the evidence is clear as day. My dad, working through the summer, is frequently gone from the house, which leaves me alone with her when I’m not working myself. During these days, I have been locked out on the back porch and told to sleep outside, because I came back 20 minutes late, have had my possessions stolen from my room, &amp; many other negative interactions over the course of the summer, (only getting worse). Today’s incident was relatively minor, though her reaction definitely aggravated the situation greatly; after spending the night at a friends house, I returned home to try and get back some sleep, as I hadn’t slept very well there. As soon as my mother hears that I am attempting to rest, she immediately bolts downstairs to get out her instruments (we are a musical family) in order to wake me up as loudly as she can. I later find out that she had absolutely no reason to “practice” (her justification), and the only reason she was even playing was in order to get me as angry as possible. When I realized this, I go downstairs to ask her nicely to consider “practicing” later, to which she returns a smirk and the classic narcissistic laugh, indicating she felt zero remorse and even enjoyed watching my visible frustration. Following this, she begins blatant gaslighting, “you sound crazy; you look out of control, etc” This kind of thing happens constantly and she seems to be getting worse and the summer winds down. It’s never been this bad, and I am currently wondering what I did in a past life to deserve this. She is 57 and acts like a dramatic 8th grader. I partially understand, seeing as her childhood household was chaotic, but it’s more than obvious that she knows full well what she’s doing.

I do have NParents, but this is more of a support-seeking post for all of my issues and not just that one, since I don't think I could separate them even if I tried.

I feel so completely broken that I'm not sure where to begin in asking for help. I have been through things that I would never wish on anyone and I'm running out of ways to cope that won't put me in the ground. When talking to a friend stopped working years ago, I turned to self-injury. That stopped working, so I turned to flat-out denial. From there, it became promiscuity. And then drugs, and then alcohol, and then more severe self-injury and now harder drugs. I'm realizing that I'm going to die if I don't help myself, and despite many years of suicidal impulses and fantasies, the thought of dying on any terms other than my own is terrifying.

I've been through many professionals. I have a loving boyfriend and one or two patient friends. No family, though. And I think the two things that I desperately need, which have been missing from everything I've tried and failed to find comfort in in the past, are (a) a person who understands on a personal level because they've been there, and (b) a person who has that whole maternal, protective thing that I've never gotten to experience. I can't recall a time in my entire life that I've felt protected, even as a young child, and I think it may help me give a shit about saving my own life to believe that I'm valuable enough to someone to be worth protecting.

If anyone at all feels like talking, I would be very grateful. I just ask that you be woman-identified, non-religious, and non-judgmental of the things I've had to do in order to survive.

So two days ago, i wanted to have some olive oil for breakfast then dad yelled at me for taking another bottle than the one he wanted me to. So mom told him it was fine then he yelled at her that it's none of her business and to shut up. Mom is 54 and he's 57.
So mom packed her clothes and went to her parents' house and the next day, he bought himself breakfast and didn't get any for me or my sister (there was nothing to eat at home). So we took a taxi to stay with mom. And then he took the car to his sister's home, she's very toxic, misogynistic, and hateful towards mom. And he didn't call me or any of my siblings.
 He has no health issues except diabetes and when he got it he blamed it on us, and so he started yelling at us everyday. Mom has huge health issues yet she does all the housework, he treats her like his maid, calls her stupid and he's never happy neither with her or us.
One day I asked if I could drink a cup of juice we had at home, and he told me no since we already eat too much (I don't eat a lot at all), whenever I try to fill my water bottle, he'll tell me I should leave the water for him. Whenever I eat in front of him, he glares at me. We're not that poor, we have a big house and can afford basic things at least.

 In March, I wanted to go leave and live in the streets, he didn't hold me and watched her fight with me because of him and he was laughing (it's always the same silence treatment method since I've been a kid) he would just watch me beg him to talk to me and cry for that, and he would tell me to go away and that I am worthless and all that even if I get the best grades and do all he wants. 
When I'm sick, i don't go to a doctor, and i don't have pocket money to do it myself. I've been suffering from deficiencies all this year and they only took me to a doctor when i had one month left for the exam.

I still remember one day he stopped talking to me and my siblings all at once for NO reason and when mom tried to intervene, he started with the ""i CaN lEaVe tHiS hOuSe iF yOu wAnT"".

But I had no outside support (lost contact with all my high school and college friends) and no money saved up. So I stayed with them after knowing what they did was wrong. Here is a list:

* **Lied about my college arrangements.** Moved to a different state. I ended up losing my car, my computer, my video games, lost the chance to be with the girl I was in love with, and I burned through my $5,000 saved up because of their lies and broken promises. After staying in a dorm for a year, they broke their promise of allowing me to stay in an apartment and sent me back to the dorms. This was all done on purpose to control me! I soon became depressed and dropped out...
* **Kicked me out of the house and made me homeless** (unless I begged for forgiveness). After a road trip thinking about things, I confronted my mother in a kind, reasonable way saying: **""You know, you've always acted like there was something wrong with me. But I was never broken inside, I was fine the way I was.""** She then starts to scream at me like a crazy person and demands my house keys and says I'm no longer allowed in the house. So I took another long road trip from Arizona to Florida. I ended up living with my grandpa in Texas and working for my aunt for a bit and my grandpa ended up driving me back to my parents. We never talked about that day.
* **Constantly locates me with my phones and lies about it.** About 10-15 years ago, Sprint had the family locator program. Since I was on their plan I would get a text message saying, ""You have just been located."" When I confronted my parents about it they said: ""They just randomly send those to you."" It doesn't matter how admit I am about the fact they JUST locating me, they give the same answer that they didn't. Honestly, I think this hurts the most. How can you treat someone like they're that stupid? Even when I started to pay for my own plan, somehow I still that message when I left to Vegas without telling them.
* **Pretended some girl who liked me (who I didn't like) was my girlfriend to the rest of the family.** I was in church and 16, my mother introduced some girl to my grandma like she was my girlfriend. I even told my mother not to do this. The girl even played along. I didn't want to cause a scene in front of my grandma, so I was just quiet. I was thinking to myself ""What the h$ll is going on here?""
* **When I told them I was getting treated badly at my career job, they told me to ignore it and just work there for 10 years cause I would make a lot money.** I think anyone who cared would tell you to find work somewhere else.  I worked 10 various hourly jobs before that, so it wasn't just employees giving me a hard time, I'm familiar with that. This was straight up abuse.
* **When my brother was stealing my food, clothes, and $100 bills out of my wallet, they wouldn't confront him about it.** They said you have no evidence so they wouldn't confront him. When I confronted him about it, he physically assaulted me. I called the cops and had him arrested. Then everyone in the family took his side. 
* **When I confront them about the past, they either won't apologize or say they don't remember and say ""that's in the past"" and to ""get over it.""**

I was a straight-A student who my teachers and peers liked. I did all the extracurriculars and was accepted to all the colleges I applied to. So why the h$ll would you start doing this to your son?!?

(I guess it was a control thing since they could no longer legally tell me what to do once I was 18 and going to college. That and a reputation thing since I was quiet. I feel like quiet to them equaled retarded as you're supposed to be perfect in every aspect including being extremely outgoing. And also a reputation thing that I didn't have a girlfriend yet despite having fallen in love with a girl in my hometown that my parents moved away from.)

This is the real problem: **I can't stop thinking about this stuff!** 

I wish I could move on but I can't. Unfortunately, I stayed with them for the last 10 years and drowned myself in self-help to avoid the truth of my situation.

Actually, it's been 20 years (18-year-old going to college to now a soon-to-be 38-year-old) since they started to treat me this way. (28 is when I gave up on my career job and started to study and write self-help and when I considered just leaving the whole situation.)  **For the most part, the way they treated me came out of NOWHERE! I think that's why it hit me so hard and why I've been trying to fix the relationship.**

And it seems like people in general are angry at me for staying with my parents and not working. I think that's also why I became a TI. (I feel like that's an entirely different situation, but I also feel like it's worth mentioning.)  I hate myself for staying there.

I need to move on, but the only way I can think to do that is to cut them out of my life. 

So I have two options:

1. **Work while living with them and slowly move away**
2. **Just leave with what little I've got**

The problem is: **I've kind of tried both options already.**

For number one, I finally got my dream job while living with them. But every weekend when I had nothing to do and no one to hang out with besides my parents, I felt extremely empty inside. The job was ultimately unfulfilling because of that, and I ended up leaving. Then I ""joined"" the self-help world/industry which does seem to fill the void to a point. But I think it was just escapism from my real problems.

For number two, I've ""ran away from home"" several times, several different ways since I was 28. I just never had that much money saved up when I did it. (Never had more than that $5,000 saved up since college. I think my unhappiness causes me to spend money on things.)

I used my car to sleep in while I went to California probably 10 times. Couldn't get used to it. Tried to bike across the county three times and then tried walking across it twice. Gave up and went home every single time. Stayed a week at a Nevada hotel and at a California hotel to start my life over. Didn't work out. I can't think of all the ways, but I've always gave up and came home.

I really don't know what to do with my life anymore. I'm just out of an abusive 3-year narc relationship with my other grandpa (went back and forth between living with him and my parents, thought he was my ticket out of there, no idea he was also a narc till 2 years into it) but now I'm permanently back here with my parents.

\-The first time I felt suicidal and was scared I'd act on it, I tried to reach out to my parents' for help, but they didn't take it seriously. So I checked myself into a psychiatric ward voluntarily so I'd get help and wouldn't impulsively commit suicide.

\-Then I went into Outpatient, and sent an email to my mother standing up for myself and setting a healthy boundary. My mother made a passive aggressive Facebook post that day, basically using FB instead of directly responding to me. She shared somebody's post that said ""if you don't heal what hurt you, you'll bleed on people who didn't cut you,"" tagged me and said ""I know this."" Because this post was my mother's subtle way of rejecting my boundary and claiming *I* was the one unfairly bleeding on *her*, because I was tagged I felt publicly humiliated, *and* because I had a history of cutting as self-harm in the past (which my mother *knew* about), this triggered me to feel suicidal and want to kill myself with a razor. I felt frightened I wouldn't be able to keep myself safe, spoke up, and got 51'50ed again.

\-The last time I got 51'50ed is because my mother abused her powers of conservaotrship over me, and it was my breaking point. My mother has medical conservatorship and access to my confidential records. She got access to my trauma-informed therapists' confidential records and discovered I dislocsed her abuse to this therapist, and this therapist believed me. My mother then used her medical power of conservaotrship to pull me out of therapy, without warning me or the therapist. She also pulled me out of psychiatry because the psychiatrist I had was co-workers with the therapist.

\-This frightened and devastated me. These professionals were the only ones who recognized I had PTSD due to my mother's abuse: everyone else my abusive parents hired for me basically gaslit and invalidated and mis-diagnosed me.

\-I realized that as long as my mother had medical and confidential records powers, I'd never get trauma-informed therapy with competent therapists again, because my mother would simply pull me out of therapy like she did with that team. And that as long as she had this power and control over me, i'd see therapists and psychiatrists who'd continue to gaslight and invalidate me over my parents' abuse and maybe even my PTSD diagnosis.

Yet the fact I was brave enough to get 51'50ed and reach out for professional help is being used to call me ""unstable"" in court. The court investigator himself believes this and said because I'm ""unstable"" he believed my parents should remain conservators and I shouldn't be allowed to petition to end the conservatorship.

Yet there's no acknowledgement that the reason I'm so unstable/felt suicidal is mainly *because* I'm going through conservatorship abuse and narcissistic abuse, and suicide felt like my only way out. And with them saying me getting 51'50ed makes me unstable, I feel I'm being sent the message the next time I feel actively suicidal, it's apparently better for me to just risk killing myself instead of recognizing the danger and reaching out for help. I don't care if they mean to send this message, this is the message I'm getting loud and clear, and it upsets me, pisses me off, and feels dehumanizing.

Yet suicide awareness/suicide prevention *advocates* doing what I did: calling a suicide hotline or telling mental health professionals if you're actively suicidal, even if that means getting hospitalized. I did what anti-suicide campaigns *claim* is the ""right thing to do"", but it's being used against me in court.

I read an entry I wrote in the ""pre-enlightenment"" era, when I didn't realise how toxic my parents were and was so sad to see some of the stuff I wrote in there. I was telling myself to open up to my mom and connect more to her (blaming myself for her unavailability and her critical nature where she weaponizes anything I say that makes opening up to her not only impossible but also UNSAFE). I had such bad fleas, where I felt super jealous of my sister for getting private tennis lessons whereas my nparents actively discouraged me from doing sports (infamously, nmom told me the day I told her I wanted to join the track and field team, ""You will quit in a couple days""), dumping my resentment and anger about the whole situation on my sister rather than my nparents, where it truly belonged.

I am kinder to other people than I was before, because I don't dump unresolved anger and resentment onto them as often.

A day later, she sends me an email letting me know the deacon at her church died, and that his daughter/wife say hello. She caps it off with ""No hidden intentions. I just wanted you to know."" I decided not to respond and blocked her emails promptly. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing she can get a reply out of me. 

I don't like that she's overstepping the NC boundary, but I can't tell if she actually is or not. Part of me is aware that she's a covert narcissist and everything she does is deliberate, but another part of me is panicking at the thought of her entering my life again.

Later as adults,  family trauma occurred and she convinced that family member to write a book about it. She guilted everyone into our family and to writing a chapter and then tried to get us all to go on Dr Phil and exploit the situation further so that she could become famous.

She somehow has the belief that if other people think she's a good person they'll give her lots of money and she'll be rich.  I'm only now realizing this could fall under narcissistic.

In this post, I just want to rant and vent about my situation, as I have a very enmeshed and dysfunctional family which I don't know how to articulate with words, but i apologize because i do not mean to sound like i am excusing toxic behaviour or insulting, blaming, and generalizing about groups of people.

My malignant narcissist father punishes me for emotionally detaching from his narcissistic bullying, or for simply showing cognitive empathy for other people. Yet my malignant narcissist dad has the nerve to justify his self absorbed, egomaniacal behaviour as ""the way it is"", that his behaviour is somehow the way the ""Real world is"", or somehow my fault for not ""letting it go"". Therefore, every interaction I have is a lose-lose situation: if I play along with his narcissist bullying, gaslighting, self absorption,  and love bombing (in order to keep the peace with him and get him off my back), i feel like I am internalizing and justifying his toxic behaviour, giving him more power over my self worth, and letting his fucked up view of the world determine my life. But if I choose not to care what he thinks by grey rocking him, he acts victimized while antagonizing me at the same time, criticizes me for supposedly ""being spoiled"" or ""not doing anything"", or he tries to control me even more. While nothing would please me more than cutting my ties with him and his toxic family, I am afraid of the social fallout (simply liking therapy posts on Instagram is enough to wound my father's ego, and not being friends and liking his toxic family members' posts is also enough to slight him, as my dad cares about sacrificing my mother's, my sister's, and my own self respect in order to make himself look ""altruistic"" and ""selfless"" to his psychopath family members. Ironic, because my dad is a self righteous, insecure, mentally unstable, delusional, narcissistic piece of human shit, whom thinks he's entitled to destroy the happiness and dreams of his own family members.), and unfortunately moving out is not an option for me as of now, as i do not have enough money and mentally i feel like my dad was right about me ""not being able to handle the real world"": being confident is not an option as my dad mocks me for doing so, but he acts like an unstable psychopath if i stand up to him and call him out for it, and emotionally manipulates me for not talking to him if he's my friend. I just feel so conflicted because whenever I have emotionally broke down and put myself down by apologizing and insulting myself for being ""worthless"" or being ""mentally broken"", my narcissist dad would ""build me back up"" (this always felt manipulative and just to bolster his own delusional ego) saying ""you're not worthless"", but if I tell him I feel like I'm always digging myself a hole, then he'll say ""well then stop digging""?? I can't have normal conversations with people because my toxic parents insist on me and my sister talking to them as if they're our friends, yet if we don't talk to them like they're our friends, they'll act offended without admitting it. While I appreciate being provided food and shelter by my parents (Even though I rationally believe that this is a minimum requirement and not a fuckign excuse for toxic behaviour) my dad frequently buys me pointless gifts in which he uses to control me emotionally by pretending that my identity is like that and getting offended if I disagree with him (weirdly enough, he used to ""not like it"" if I thanked him when i was younger by saying to me ""we're family. we don't need to thank each other"". Yet, nowadays, he acts entitled to me thanking him in a scared, childlike tone of voice, as he acts threatened if I do not thank him for him doing shit i can either easily do myself or for doing things I never wanted him to do for me. I do not want anything from him, yet he loves to pretend that I am spoiled. If I thank him in a confused or unenthusiastic tone of voice, although im lucky he doesn't rage as often as he did when i was younger, he gaslights me by saying that if i am in a bad mood i should take ""natural supplements"".)

The worst part is, I don't know anymore if my dad is right, seeing how due to my cowardice to stand up to his fucked up behaviour back when I was a teen, I always sound out of touch, overly apologetic, childlike, and hypersensitive whenever someone talks down to me, laughs at me, or angrily criticizes me, but I don't want to turn into my toxic dad or toxic mother to cope. Although I feel sorry for how my malignant narcissist dad and his family treat her, I feel that she does not give me healthy feedback at all: she either infantilizes me like a fucking baby who can't do no wrong and lovebombs me, pressures me for ""not telling her everything"", acts offended if I simply speak normally and confidently, or she gives really passive aggressive, unclear guilt trips to shame me (Without admitting it of course). My mother runs a home daycare, in which she treated me like a golden child in front of the other kids, which always made me feel deep shame seeing how despite her caring about their physical wellbeing, she never had an issue with shaming them, emotionally manipulating them, and emotionally abusing them. Although I've tried to show the kids there compassion as much as I've could, I hate myself for being too much of a coward to report her, due to being afraid of ""disrupting the peace"" at home. I can't call out my mother, as she frequently acts as if Im oppressing her if im merely trying to stand up to her toxic actions: I feel sorry for my mother's lack of confidence, abuse she went through, and low self esteem, but i do not sympathize with her toxic behaviour towards her daughter and to the kids she takes care of.

While my sister does validate some of the toxic behaviour my parents have done (such as my father's mentally unstable, psychopathic, and narcissistic rages, my parents' racist and sexist insults or ""jokes"", my mother's emotional abuse of the children at her daycare and of her daughter, some of my father's weird gaslighting remarks), my sister unintentionally excuses my father's and mother's narcissistic behaviour, gaslights me, gives me contradictory feedback (if i beat myself up and put myself down when talking about negative interactions with people, she'll give me supportive but constructive feedback, and at times overly sympathize with me. if i try to speak confidently about my negative interactions with my narcissist dad, she'll criticize me for ""seeing the worst in people"".)

My dad punishes me for grey rocking him by blaming me for ""not caring"" or treating me as if I'm somehow abusing him; thus, he assigns me pointless chores to soothe his ego, acts passive aggressive, belligerent, and offended if I don't discuss my hobbies with him (seeing how he always uses them either to brag to his toxic family, or to mock me or ""praise"" me if they're hobbies he likes/make him ""look"" good. He likes to pretend he's a fucking drill sergeant, except he was in the military for a couple of years and everything he does is to bolster his own ego, tear down our social boundaries and makes us feel inadequate and insecure in front of toxic people or simply mean and difficult people rather to make us ""tougher"" and more ""disciplined"", seeing how my dad is triggered by me and my sister not giving af about his toxic behaviour and what he thinks.). 

The worst part is, I have no clue if my malignant narcisist dad's gaslighting and abuse is somehow ""right"". I can't even tell the difference between toxic gaslighting/bullying or genuine attempts at friendly joking, teasing, banter, or constructive criticism. At my high school and university, i remember always feeling triggered and insecure of what teachers, professors, and teaching assistants thought about and currently think of me, as some of them did things that always felt the same as how my dad would've treated me and other people. For example, I would always get triggered by their ""jokes"", about how students were somehow ""spoiled"" or believed that ""teachers/professors/teaching assistants"" were ""out to get them"". I would also get offended if people with authority would make sarcastic and/or condescending remarks, or make comments that I would feel that were emotionally manipulative (e.g. once i could not tell if my professor was joking or genuinely being mean spirited when he bitterly criticized the class during lecture for supposedly having ""messy handwriting"", saying ""we (professors) have feelings too"". some people in the class laughed, but i could not tell if they were doing this because they were nervous, they were scared of being mocked by the professor, they wanted to laugh along the professor, or if they were trying to put down their fellow students). I can't have a normal conversation with my fellow students without feeling nonstop shame and that I need to over apologize, because if i don't apologize then i feel like i sound narcissistic myself when i simply try to speak normally and confidently.

I perceive myself to be an ex-GC in my family, given the way my parents turned on me for having different political opinions from them. I believe I was a GC since I noticed me and me sister having different treatments. One of these include my parents setting me up with a license/training immediately after turning 16, meanwhile they told my sister ""you're gonna have to find someone to make time for yours"". Another more serious instance was when they ended up removing my sister's door for her resistance to their abuse, but not removing mine. However, after they found out about my political opinions, they started an emotional and mental harassment campaign that I did not see coming, and it almost ended in my suicide. They would gaslight numerous situations, coerce me into doing different favors for them, and my *personal* favorite, actively fuck with my sleep schedule when I had school. I ended up going to the hospital for a week since I was in so much mental pain.

When I tried to talk to some of my immediate and extended family members about what happened a safe distance away from my parents, they either changed the subject or denied it happened. This makes me absolutely furious by the way. As a result, I have not had a normal conversation with any of my family members since before the hospital visit.

&amp;nbsp;

Like, the aforementioned valuing my freedom and lifestyle.  That's awfully selfish of me when I say ""I don't want kids cause I value myself more"", and yet it's also my life and I totally have freedom and responsibility over it.  Still it feels like I'M the narcissist for thinking ""Don't become a parent cause you'll have to spend twenty or so years focusing entirely on someone else as your top priority instead of yourself"".

&amp;nbsp;

Or the thought of accidentally screwing them up in a moment of weakness at the absolute wrong moment.  Because I am a sarcastic attention whore, absolutely I am.  I never got enough attention from my folks and it gave me a bottomless pit of need for reassurance and attention that I just know would press me in the wrong parenting decisions or lack of decisions at the worst of times.  Hell my driving force in life I have described as ""I will be remembered after I die not for who I was related to, but for what I've created"", because ANYONE can pump out offspring and be remembered by them for a generation or two, crappy parent or great parent, but creating something that will be remembered by others who have no prior obligation to remember you means you actually DID something.  And right there is exactly what I'm talking about with the desperate desire for meaningful attention, and how I feel like that desire would absolutely NOT screw up a kid by doing something in the wrong moment, or hell at any and all moments.  ""How can I be sure my kids gonna remember me for what I DO instead of just being ""daddy""?  Do I try to show them and make them understand my work?  my hobbies?  what do I do???""

Or especially how I feel absolutely terrified of a future me that hypothetically does have kids being absolutely fed up with them after 6 years and becoming the kind of ""screw you kid you do as I say"" nparent, and how I feel like an asshole that I can see my future self as that without much difficulty.  Mostly cause of the evidence of how my housemates renting from me test my patience on the stupidest little things and they actually get to me, like complaining about how accent lights I put in the kitchen always shine directly into their eyes too brightly and unplug them to spite me even after I install a dimmer switch on them, or other stupid stuff I shouldn't get side tracked into ranting about.  I mean, I understand how a child would be a million times worse and get on my nerves a billion times more because they don't have the make-up consolation of paying me every month to deal with them, even though I know it wouldn't be their fault at all because kids would be kids.

i don't even remember this happening in my early childhood, but back then i was receiving so much validation from other parents and hearing them say i was the daughter they all wished they had. i felt very good hearing that a lot, and it made me feel superior from the other kids. i guess it could explain why i was bullied by those that i thought were cool, and why i was an asshole to those that actually *did* care about me.

it wasn't until middle school where i'd open up about feeling depressed and just not good overall where i kept getting shit like ""you're too young to know what depression is like, you're just doing it to get attention, you're perfectly fine, stop lying to your friends about this"", that last line was because they would look through my conversations between me and friends and them questioning what i meant by that was when i had to open up about it. 

i thought they were supposed to care, but it kept going and it never really changed since then. i was also forced to come out as queer in middle school as well for the same reason, they always felt the need to look through my shit. i had a secret phone to avoid them from tracking what i do on my main phone too but i got caught with it. it's safe to assume they also did not take my queerness all too well, they even publicly shamed me for it. 

in the beginning of the year i've had to come to terms with me possibly having ADHD, and it all made sense with how i've been doing academically both in college and everything else before it. i've been doing extremely shitty in college, my GPA is not high enough for me to register for the fall semester and i've been kicked out until spring. i want to tell them i think i have ADHD and i need to seek a diagnosis to make sure, but i'm worried it'll trace back to me not knowing shit and that i'm only making excuses for doing so bad in my classes. i went from being an honor roll/GT student, to a student that can't even hold at least a 70 for very long. it's not that i'm stupid, i know i'm not. it's just me being forgetful a lot of the time, as well as spacing out during lectures and being unable to take notes without being distracted. if i write my notes out then i'll either doodle on my paper or be too focused on getting everything down to even pay attention to anything else. if i type my notes out i'll also be too focused on making sure my notes are perfect, or play games instead, and if i just sit there and listen, i'll forget all about it without anything to look back on. 

pretty sure i can send in a repeal to explain what happened, but i would need proof of being tested for ADHD which i don't have. and if i still try and it doesn't work out then i'm gonna have to come clean about not being able to take classes (again)!! it's scary with them, i wish they were more understanding and see that i'm not a lazy pile of shit.

i'm almost positive i can afford a diagnosis, it's just the lack of support from my family as well as the lack of independence from my part. i don't even have a job because i have to stay behind and take care of my brother when he comes home and clean the house before he does. and if i do work it has to be under my parents' terms. i don't know how to drive either since no one has the time or energy to teach me after working all day. i can't do shit for myself and it's frustrating. i do plan on moving out soon and stick with some friends so i can be able to build up my independence slowly but surely.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713610,public,self,i can't seem to gather up the courage to say anything to my parents without getting ridiculed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p7hsdj/i_cant_seem_to_gather_up_the_courage_to_say/,some_ads,7,supporturgent,b4c5598c-82c9-11e3-9642-12313d27e9a3,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

My mom likes to make me feel like I’m incompetent or can’t do anything without needing assistance. I’ll admit, I’m not the sharpest tool in the tool shed and I’m not the strongest, either, but I’m not stupid nor helpless. However, my mom makes me feel like I am stupid sometimes. Anyway, when I first got my car, there was one time where my stepdad had to check inside the hood for some repair work. My mom told me to pop the hood and open it. Well, at the time, I haven’t had my car for long, so I was still learning where everything was as far as buttons and mechanics. I first had to find the button in the front seat to even pop the hood. My mom kinda rolled her eyes at me and sighed, but the kicker for me was when I did pop the hood and had to go over and feel for the little lever to actually open it. I had a hard time finding it because I wasn’t sure where it was, and it was my first time having to open the hood. But, instead of my mom helping me and showing me where the lever was, she just said, “Wow, you can’t even open the hood, Oh, my God. How are you going to do this yourself? Wow.” I was so annoyed, but eventually my stepdad helped me in opening the hood. I’ve had my car for a few years now, so luckily I have it down pat, but at the time I just felt really stupid because she made it sound like I *should* know where the lever is/was, despite not having any prior knowledge on opening a car hood beforehand.

So I’ve never shared my story here before but I feel this is detrimental. My mom is not only a narc but also a raging drug addict. My entire life I’ve endured physical beatings, verbal abuse, being surrounded by drugs, watching strange men come in and out of her life, frequently spending nights alone in random trap houses etc. Fortunately I escaped as soon as i turned 18. Mom pretends to be confused by my abrupt leave and continues to harass me occasionally either by text (from a fake number) or runs to the rest of the family to tarnish my name. Because of this I receive frequent phone calls from my grandparents and other members of the family calling me disrespectful and demanding that I forgive my mom. And yes, they know everything because i’ve called them in panic multiple times before trying to expose my mom in hopes of them doing something. And their response was “it doesn’t matter.” Instead, they enable her behavior and send her funds even when they know exactly what it’s for. So now all  their numbers are blocked. But the remaining problem is that my younger sibling (15) is still under her care but ILLEGALLY as she does not have custody. CPS was called on her before, by her school and they took my sister away and my grandparents illegally sent her back to live under those same circumstances. (i resent them a lot for this as they are very wealthy and even took me in as a child for a couple years but would not do the same for her because “they don’t like teenagers”) If you couldn’t already tell I come from a Narcissistic family with a cult-like mentality. Anyway, I’m afraid for
the safety and future of my sister and am contemplating calling CPS to explain my mother and the severe neglect my sister is still facing. Unfortunately she’s being manipulated and love bombed by our mother and so she already thinks I’m the bad guy. I know she isn’t my responsibility but I can’t help but feel the need to get her out of there. Im fairly young so I’m not sure if i’d be able to support her/take her in but it might be the only way.

He would always require me to look at him when he was speaking or it was automatically disrespectful - to the point where one time when I was on the computer talking to him with my back to him he stomped over to me and grabbed my shirt with his fist cocked back like he was going to punch me 

He will constantly talk about how he couldn’t spend more than an hour with my brother and I by himself because “any longer than that and I would go crazy” 

We have recently moved and all of a sudden my mom in constantly asking how I’m doing, how much they miss us being around, saying “we don’t hear from you after the move so we have a very parental habit of thinking the worst…”

Apologies for formatting - I'm on mobile. This is going to be a long one.

My husband has been miserable this past year and a half with his family - but lately I think he's having a serious mental health crisis. This list is exhaustive but here are some of the things that have happened:


• DH had a stint in rehab for alcohol addiction last year, and when he got out, he got no support from his family. (I was overseas at the time and stuck because of the pandemic). My FIL and MIL drank in front of him (they are all addicts).
• A couple of days after rehab, MIL found out that FIL was cheating on her with their next door neighbour, chaos ensues.
• When DH was buying his first house one month after rehab, and FIL bullied him about how he could negotiate a better price/ be able to find a better house for him. No support
• FIL fucked off to Florida with his mistress and married her. DH barely speaks to him anymore. 
• FIL is a wife beater, he has domestic assault charges for hitting MIL 20ish years ago.
• He holds extremist views and would attack DH and I if we posted anything moderately liberal on Facebook.

At the time, while I was overseas, I thought FIL was the only monster in this family.

Then I discovered how awful MIL is.


• While DH was in rehab, she convinced and told my SIL to message me asking me to back off from contacting DH while he was in there (because she thought I was jeopardising his recovery). When I got these messages, I was super upset and messaged MIL in confidence about how I didn't appreciate SIL telling me not to contact DH. MIL screenshot my DMs about this and sent it to SIL.
• MIL tried to sabotage our wedding earlier this year. I could be typing forever about her behaviour that day. My family back home couldn't travel to the US to attend (as there was a travel ban). She was the person who I was relying on to help me get ready and she literally done the opposite and made the day about her. She also didn't want to be in the photos and went home early that day.
• She talks about everyone behind their backs. She's repeatedly said very xenophobic things about me.
• She pits family members against each other.
• She lied to my husband that she had three years to live, when her doctor did not say that. He was devastated.
• She is a compulsive liar and uses this to her advantage.


My DH has a brother, and their relationship is rocky at the moment. My husband is the golden child, and has only gotten a real taste of his parents abuse in the last couple of years. He says he never really paid attention to their behaviour as he was a heavy drinker. His brother is an alcoholic also, but he has dealt with a great deal of their abuse growing up.

DH and his brother are in a group chat with a bunch of other gamers where they shoot the shit. Recently his brother and one other person has gone full Q Anon and more politically extreme, and this spills over into the chat. They like to pick on DH if he tries to refute his points calling him names. 

His brother has said things to his wife about DH that she has told me. They range from ""DH is just like mom, he's a lost cause"", to ""DH doesn't want anything to do with me because of mom"". This couldn't be further from the truth as DH doesn't really speak to his parents much anymore. 

Yesterday, DH had a mental breakdown over his family. His feelings range from anger, shame, guilt and sadness. He doesn't know what to do with them or if he should cut them off. I think he's scared of the blowback he will get from them if he does this. It really worries me as he's gone from happy-go-lucky to depressed and withdrawn. I'm so proud of him for changing his life around, but it seems his family are trying to sabotage that.

During the pandemic I watched a lot of people in their 20’s (I’m 28), move back home with their parents. I live alone and have been on my own since I was 17.  I had no option of moving back home. I live out of state to be far away from my family. My parents were both physically abusive and emotionally abusive. My narcissistic mom and I used to talk more up until the pandemic when my resentment for her spiraled out of control. When we would talk before, it was only via text and the conversations were meaningless most of the time. Like she didn’t have a genuine interest in my life, it felt forced and never deep. I’ve recently gone no contact for both of them. And I feel completely alone in the world. Recently had a minor car accident and I had no one to turn to for support. I wish I had parents I could call. I have a loving boyfriend now (8 months) , but I subconsciously push him away out of here of getting too close and getting hurt. He has a close relationship with his mom and she is very supportive and loving. Sometimes it bothers me. I feel lots of envy and I can see in our personalities how our relationship with our parents has shaped us in such different ways. While he’s very compassionate and patient, he simply can’t understand my trust issues, anger, depression, loneliness. How could he? 
When we visit his moms house there are so many photos of him and his sister all over. So many happy memories in those photos. It makes me feel like shit honestly. My mom would never. In fact, there was an incident once where my little sister found childhood pics of us in the trash. It was when her and my mom were moving to a new apartment and my mom claimed the reason was that she scanned all the pics and therefor didn’t need the physical copies. I visited the new apartment before the pandemic and there were no photos of me or my siblings. No big deal but it does trigger me to see all the love he has. I’m affected by this every day. I’m constantly replaying memories of my parents physically beating me while verbally abusing me. My lip is permanently uneven because of how hard my dad hit me on my mouth one day. You can’t notice it that much but I can, and it haunts me. When I was 17 they sent me away to another country to live with my dad’s psychotic sister. This was because I was depressed and was cutting myself and running away from home due to the physical abuse. After they sent me away I stayed in that country for 4 years until I was 21. I’m 28 now and don’t live in the same state as them and never see them. Last time I saw my dad was 7 years ago and he hit me. I saw my mom last year and she made no effort to have any type of meaningful conversation. I feel completely alone, I have no guidance or role models / never have. Feels like I raised myself. People praise me on how strong and independent I am but I don’t want to have to be independent at all times. I’ve been in therapy for almost a year and it’s helping just a little but it’s not enough. What else can I do??? I’m considering going to a crisis center for resources. I wish I had friends who have similar situations so that we could be each others support, but honestly they all mostly have great relationships with their parents.

Even though I KNOW he probably will never admit he needs it, my brother reestablishing contact will make Ndad think that all of us will come back to him. It makes me feel totally hopeless.

Ndad is a master at ingratiating himself to people. My brother has had money troubles (new house, newly divorced) lately, and I'm pretty sure he's allowing himself contact with my dad because he's offering money. He's allowing himself to be bought and has no problem with that (it's come up before when my dad started leaving me checks after fights, which I rejected. Brother said he would've cashed them). That, in turn, is making Ndad feel like this is a normal and acceptable behavior.

However, he has displayed many narcissistic qualities and withdrew during our family decision-making to cut Ndad out. But he has shown resilience and heart when it mattered.

When I found out, all I could say to my brother was to please respect our boundaries and not talk about us to NDad, which he agreed to. I asked him to tell the other NC family members to not breach their trust, but he ignored me.

Sister and Mother show signs of being unable to take responsibility for their actions while I have to ""let go"" of things and ""try my best"". I feel unsatisfied and unhappy at home. Everything feels stagnant.

First off, thank you for taking the time to read my post. I'm going to try and make this as unbiased as possible for everyone involved.

I (22F) have grown up in an abusive and toxic family. My dad (63) abused my mother (59) throughout the years and our household was divided. I grew up with two elder sisters and one elder brother. I was bullied by my brother and grew up with a number of mental issues, to say the least. The bullying stopped in high school but there were still a lot of arguments until my mother kicked my father out once we went to university.

It is safe to say, Mother endured a lot for the sake of allowing us to grow up with a Father until we were at the age we could handle a separation. Time fast forward, and things have settled a lot in our house. No arguments etc.

We have all started our own healing journeys (apart from my brother and one sister I think). Sister #1 (31), we'll call her S1, reads a lot of books as for my Mother who reads a lot of self-improvement and spirituality books. This is for the same as me.

I recently started taking my healing journey seriously and began shadow work that explored my past trauma. I began to realize a lot of ways I lacked boundaries and I also explored a lot of ways this led to me being mistreated growing up e.g bullying, attracting those who disregarded my (non-existant) boundaries.

But I always felt resistance around returning home from university. I feel as if I was scapegoated in my family. I told my mother this I don't think she considered my perspective too much. Even reading a lot, I realized I was still being disrespected by my elders in the house.

An example of this is one time I asked my S1 and S2 to clean the bathroom. They ignored me over text at first but when I chased them up S1 went into a speech about how I did not need to be a hero all the time and if I left it then it would be done - except I had left it for a week and a half and it wasn't being done. I felt like shit and I told Mother but I believe she only told me to ignore her.

I'd like to say S1 (who I live with mainly) works a lot. She puts in a lot of hours and I can appreciate she feels exhausted a lot. I, myself, do not work, but I try to ensure I put in a lot of housework as possible.

Fast forward to March when I returned home from university. One sign of trouble came from when I tried making jokes with Mother. She would often give me a dead, straight face and I eventually gave up trying to make jokes with her, however, she would come to me later and say she thinks I lost my sense of humour. I believe this came from her trying to make jokes with me but I would not be receptive due to our earlier instances.

In the meantime, S1 has her things in my room in a wardrobe she paid for. It is a better wardrobe than what I had for before and I am truly grateful for it but I do not have enough space for my things. The first time I asked S1 to move out she tried to joke it was her wardrobe but I did not laugh as I was serious. I told her I felt disrespected but she told me to be positive which I told her was toxic. She then went on a long speech telling me to basically accept her being in my room and I had nothing to say.

So I continued my shadow work and due to a lot of trauma coming to the surface, I began feeling down which was noticeable. Mother would ask me what was wrong but I would brush her off until one day I came to her and told her how I felt about growing up in the house. She told me to let it go and that growing up wasn't that bad. I personally feel like she dismissed my feelings.

I also told her about times I felt disrespected and gave her examples... For instance, at times she was sarcastic to me for no reason and she told me I need to accept the way people are. I told her about S1's things in my room and she told me S1 came to her. I asked her what she cried about and Mother said some people have a lot going on. I told Mother this was emotional manipulation and Mother made everything about me.

Despite being unhappy in the house, I was told I should consider therapy and that I should try and do better. Mother also told me about her she had to endure a lot of abuse in those past years and went on a long speech about Lord knows what.

Fast forward to today, I have been unhappy for a 48 hours, staying in my room and just being by myself because nothing I bring up gets resolved. Mother came to my room and said ""can't you wash up when we're not here?"" BARING IN MIND, I always wash up when I see dishes in the sink. Last year, it was me that was washing up most days. S1 sits at a table and does work. I always feel like the dishes get left to me to do.

I've been doing so for the past months. I have been feeling depressed and unhappy but I feel like Mother came to me, judging me for not washing up. I told her I was busy so I could not talk in that moment but she left on a final note of judging me.

I exploded. I went downstairs and ranted about how I feel like I am not considered. I called out their hypocrisy and told S1 and Mother everything is about my issues and how I need therapy and how they can not take responsibility for their actions. I also told MOther she had a victmin mentality and mocked her for her abuse (bad I know and I am not proud of it)

S1 told my mother I called her mentally abusive when I asked her to move out of my room. I told her Mother told me how she cried to her and they both denied it. S1 accused me of being aggressive the first time I asked her to move out of my room (the second, Mother was present).

I snapped at them and said I would happily move out and not speak to them. Honestly, if I was able to leave, I would happily do so. I told them both they had victim mentalities and they told me they are worried about my mental health and denied everything I brought up.

What do you guys think about this situation? I will clarify further if needs be. What do I do? Communication is lacking in my house but I feel like what I bring up will always be my fault.

She made me view myself like I belonged to her collection of animals. I wasn’t allowed to keep secrets from her, could never play with my friends without my mom first ‘getting to know them’ or ‘showing interest’.

Up until 6-7 years old my friends liked that, I had lots of friends. But around that age they started calling me mommas boy, I slowly lost everyone. I asked my best friend for advice, he told me keep secrets from her, become independent. I immediately did that, my mom went crazy immediately. I wasn’t allowed to go to bed. Because my dad would ‘teach me a lesson’. I said ‘no he won’t’. I fell asleep on the couch that night only to awaken in the middle of the night to hear them screaming. She managed to get my dad to beat me up, while he was crying, telling me to not keep secrets from mom. I told him I’m loosing everyone, he said, daddy knows, just don’t keep secrets from mom.

Ever since that day I focused on the farm we had, on the animals. Because that were the only living things that appreciated me. Only my mom was there to continuesly tell me I didn’t put in effort. She started medicating me at age 11 with antipsychotics. For some reason I kept taking those pills till a couple months ago, including with a lot of other chemicals you wouldn’t want to give to a horse. I quit everything a couple months ago and I’m just shocked by how I function. I can’t even eat with knife and fork, because mom never thought me, she just gave me a spoon. She can’t use the knife and fork herself and makes a mess out of it every time. But according to her, it’s all my own fault.

Now I’m sober, I realise I don’t even have developed an identity. So I started with throwing all her shit and that of her crazy imbecile sister out of my home. So nothing reminds me of her in my home. Got a haircut done. Which she always used to do for me, because otherwise I wouldn’t want that huge crest on my head, which I didn’t like. According to her my head looks dirty and fatty when I have a short hairstyle. So I went for short with a lot of wax, just because I can.

I went to my GP. Who said he’d help me get my life going, but I’m not sure he understands. Also did an entry exam to get into university, which I passed. I never graduated highschool because mom send me to a special needs school. One where all the kids did the haldol shuffle.

I do my best taking care of myself, cooking good food, etc. But I’m just not sure how to deal with other people. I don’t know what I can tell them, how much I should tell them. I only lived for all those animals we had for so long, they used to be my whole world. Giving me what my mom never could, showing gratitude for the effort I put in. I’m talking to my GP next week to get some advice on how to behave while starting university next month.

Because I was never allowed to keep secrets from mom. I told her so much crap, she would stop bothering me. Made constant jokes out of myself so she wouldn’t hurt me further. I find myself behaving that way with other people and I don’t want that.

I want to be able to keep secrets and not feel the need to say rediculous things to make people question what’s true. Just be able to have normal conversations, a skill I’ve never learned. It’s been my defence mechanism against that bitch for so long, I don’t know how to change it overnight. 

Somewhere I feel the need to go tell her the truth. But I know, she would love that, she’d make a circus out of it, make me feel guilty and make me reinstate contact and figure out all my secrets. She leaves me alone for the time being, so let’s keep it that way. She already stole my childhood.

Im also planning on not having contact with the rest of her family. Because they tell her everything.

My mom was bad at school too and her Dad would be angry but her Mom supported her nonetheless. You’d think she would be understanding pf what I had to deal with at school and even college now but no. I get no support at all. just physical abuse and verbal abuse 

Im 21 now. I cant talk to anyone in my family becuase they have toxic tendencies. I avoid talking or being in the same proximity as my parents or siblings because they will give me bad looks or say negative things about me, get angry and start acting annoyed. 

I dont have a job and as much as I want to get one, Ive been way too stressed out lately with relationships, my physical and mental health and other things. I pretty much shut myself off from everyone because I felt I had to in order to take steps forward 

The are constantly  comparing me to my brother who had “a lot” more freedom and knowlegde about the world than I did even at my age now. He wasnt even 15 yet he was allowed across the country no problem. He would leave for months and be back like no one cared. Me, 18. I need. Permission to walk the shop. 20meters away..

Basically I feel like Ive never really experienced anything in life and im trying to do too much at once because its what my parents want me to do while also trying to balance fixing my mental health, my possible eating disorder, and exercising, college as well as other things they have stopped me from doing. 

I feel held back mentally by what they will think and say If I do a certain thing. My parents have me fucked up and are expecting things from me when Im doing my best simply trying to recover. Like just an hour ago they were screaming at me for being underweight saying im gonna die and some other crap I cant remember then start asking me why I dont have a drivers license or fiance and what not. If you need to know, they arent a necessity when Im doing the most just trying to stay alive

Im stressed out. I only wanna get better and THEN get a job.

My mom continuously yells at her and was like that to me as well, i have a deep self hatred and low self esteem now in my 20s, I'm very shy and can barely talk to people. I don't want my sisters self esteem to be impacted like that but apparently it is, she doesn't like anything about herself as well and even though I keep telling her she's beautiful, she doesn't seem to believe it. 
Mind you that my sister is also difficult, she has a strong violent character, anger bursts, but I believe this is all because she feels misunderstood.

My (30M) parents and I had a difficult relationship growing up, but things were going pretty well with them up until last June when my Dad passed away suddenly. I had mixed feelings about his death as, while I loved him, he was an alcoholic and that affected his ability to be a good parent. My mom is an emotionally abusive narcissist who knows how to push everyone's buttons in order to get what she wants out of people. When my Dad died, he left my NMom behind and she went into a tailspin. 

The past year has been full of guilt trips, manipulation, and emotional abuse. I will only share one example in order to keep this short... after I had moved in with her for approx. 2 months following my Dad's death, I was preparing to leave for a series of road trips in September, at the end of which I was going to propose to my now-fiancee. I was going to be gone for like 2 weeks and was very visibly excited about the upcoming engagement. On my way out the door my Mom sat me down out of the blue and gave me on of the worst guilt trips of my life, including insinuating that I can't leave for my trip and do my proposal because ""I need you to be here with me as my companion."" It really messed with me and put a damper on the whole thing. 

I eventually reconnected with my therapist in order to start working on anger issues. We determined that my anger issues stem from a childhood of abuse, as anger is a defense mechanism to help prevent abuse. My therapist has been helping me understand why healthy boundaries are necessary. Setting boundaries has been complicated as my mom still needs to sell her house and we (my twin sister and I) have been doing a LOT of work on it (for example, we did $20,000 in drywall repairs after it was discovered that one of the piles of hoarded shit in the basement had covered the walls in black mold). My sister and I both just want to get this house sold so we can move on with our lives but my mom kept adding more and more stuff to the ""list"" while delaying listing it on the market. 

My sister, our fiancees, and I got together recently and decided enough is enough, that we would insist that she either put the house on the market or pay for someone else to continue to improve the house. Essenrially, enough with the free work, we have our own lives. On the 1 year anniversary of my Dad's death, my fiancee and I went over to her house for dinner. It was the typical stuff (she wasn't going to eat because she is too sad, etc.). The conversation turned to the house and I asserted that she should sell it ASAP. She countered with ""there is so much that still needs to be done."" I said ""you need to pay someone to do that stuff, because I can't do all of it."" Her response was ""why would I do that when I have children who are supposed to help me?"" 

She then laid into me with a shocking and nasty amount of emotional abuse, like ""you are a bad son,"" ""I am disappointed in you,"" and ""I thought you were here to support me but I guess you're just here to abandon me in my time of need."" I stuck to my guns and didn't lose my temper... just stayed stoic and assertive about the whole thing (thanks therapy!) until she kicked us out of the house. 

Since then I've decided to go Low Contact. It was very revealing to hear the abuse coming out of her that heavily... it's almost like that abusive intent has been the whole time but she's been more tactful about it in the past. 

I've talked to her just a few times. She sent a text saying she doesn't know why our relationship is strained. I explicitly told her that I am setting boundaries as a part of my trauma work in therapy due to the abuse I suffered as a child at home, school, and church (she is heavily religious and is a director of religious education for the Catholic Church). She said she would do ""whatever it takes"" to repair our relationship. 

We had my sister's wedding last month and my fiancee suggested that I ask her to dance for a slow song. During our dance she started saying things like ""I'm sorry for whatever I did"" and ""Can we please just go to the pool together?"". This rubbed me the wrong way because it's not a matter of ""whatever you did."" You told me I was a bad son like a month ago after I fixed your house up for a year. I'm seriously not mad about it, but like, do you not understand why that was a problem? Do I want this person to continue to be a presence in my life? Also, is she still just trying to get something out of me? 

Yesterday, I called my sister with some exciting news about grad school and at the end of the conversation she said ""you should call mom and tell her, she has been asking about you and wondering how you are."" I was going to call my mom... until I thought ""why?"" I don't want to open myself up to her misery and emotional abuse today. Later on, I got a text from my mom saying that she misses me.

When we arrived at the dentist since its covid we werent allowed to go in and had to speak to the receptionist from the front window to confirm our booking and then they told my Nmum that I was only allowed in and that she had to wait outside until I finished my appointment due to covid restrictions and such and its not like the staff meant any hatred or I'll will for my Nmum they were litterly just following the law.

And then this was when all hell broke loose and my mum started litterly arguing with the reception staff to let her in so she could be with me just incase I cried once I got my braces on and they told her she was not allowed in and even if she was she is not allowed to go into the operation room with me she due to covid so she would have to wait in the reception.

In the end they finally told her she could come in after her arguing with the staff for a while and they told her she had to wear a mask before she was allowed in thoe and since my non-vaccinated  and non-mask wearin Nmum didn't have one on they tried to give her one to wear and my Nmum had the audacity to litterly refuse to wear the mask and be like ""it's ok I will just put up my shirt and use that as a mask"" (said in a Karen tone) and then the receptionist again said politely  ""plz put on the mask otherwise your not allowed to come in"" and after much argument and rebuttal from my Nmums and she finally agreed to wear the mask and came inside and sat down on a chair 2 meters away from me and she was still kinda complaining but in our language this time instead of English.


And then the receptionist informed my mum that she wasn't allowed to come into the actual operation/dentist room with me and that she would have to wait in the reception waiting area and my mum argued back again like this was getting to my nerves at this point and I litterly wanted to shout and tell my mum to shut the hell up but sadly I missed that opportunity.

And then the orthodontist came and called me to my appointment/operation room and then as I was getting up to leave I told my Nmum in my language to just sit there and not say anything and she said ok.

And then in the room the orthodontist bascially told me what I had already thought and said this was my first appointment to towards getting my braces and that I wasnt actually gonna get braces today.

And they told me to go to the reception and book a checkup appointment to get my teeth checked and then when I went there as I went up the receptionist my mum got up and was asking me questions about what they said and stuff like that and I didnt want to deal with her so I didn't answer back and then whilst I was booking my appointment for my checkup the receptionist said since I was already there they had a free orthodontist doctor available and said I would have to wait upstairs for 15 minutes and at this point they told my mum she would have to wait outside agian and again the child like tantrum on why she cant wait outside  started and I was just over my Nmumd attitude so I just went upstairs completely ignoring her whole she argued with the receptionist on why she should be allowed to sit with me and then finally I heard her say ""i'm going, I am going"" very loudly from upstairs and I just felt hella embarrassed about the whole situation.

Anyway I had my checkup and when I was heading downstairs to leave I wanted to apologise to the reception staff for my Nmums behaviour but I was too embarrassed.


Anway I went outside and as too nobody's surprise my mum was still mad about the whole situation and she basically decided she wanted to let the whole world know how mad she was as she continued to complain in our language very loudly on our way to the bus stop saying things like this is why I hate ""Christians or non muslims"" because my mother is a muslim and hates anyone from any religion other than her own and I told her to quite down but she wouldn't listen.

And then when we went onto the bus my Nmum who I was clearly mad at couldn't tell I was mad at her so she reportedly asked me the same question of ""what did the orthodontist say about your braces and teeth"" and I kept replying by saying ""pls stop talking"" which sounds way better and nicer than it does in English and plus there were people on the bus and my Nmum had no respect for them and was like ""are we not allowed to talk"" I mean we could but I'm mad at you and your talking very loudly and that's fucking rude to the other passengers. And after a while of me responding with the same line she got the memo and said ""fine I will stop talking"".

And then when we got of the bus and was walking home she kept saying how she would write a formal complaint about the reception staff and how she would get them all fired. 

And I was fast walking and after a while o stopped to get the house keys from her and continued to fast walk home and she said ""why are you walking so fast , why are you mad at me I did nothing wrong"".
I didn't respond quickly entered the house took my shoes off and went to my room not before telling my two siblings what our mum did and both of them agreed that, that was embarrassing.

yeah fuck that noise. I sent her back a letter that said kindly fuck off and don’t contact me again you bitter old woman. Instead of worrying about me perhaps you should worry about the legal fees you’ll end up paying the next time your pedophile son tries to rape a child again. ( one of the many reasons I decided to go nc with the entire family is because they all shamed me for being disgusted to be around my uncle who is a repeat offender and it escalated to the point he raped a 12 year old and went to prison for it. But ngmom said that the ‘little hussy shouldnt have lied and said she was 18. ‘ keeping in mind ngmom shamed me when I finally started speaking about the fact I got raped in college.). I also put a p.s. you‘re the worst manipulator of them all. You should be ashamed of yourself for condoning abuse as long as it fits within your perfect family narrative. 

Also the joke is on them I stopped talking to my dad and stepmom in nov 2020 because they went full blown pandemic bonkers with the vaccines are the mark of the devil bullshit.

i just want these fucking people to respect my wishes enough to leave me the fuck alone. I don’t want to be around them. My life has gotten so much more peaceful ever since I stopped talking to them.

I have been doing a lot of self-reflection (which is something that I do often especially with the help of my therapist and the mindfulness that I do), I have been reflecting on my past self and I realised that over the years, I have been doing with large amounts of anger and fury, sometimes in explosive ways and especially towards anything and anyone (including me). 

I still struggle with anger but I noticed that I sometimes manage to suppress it or process it but knowing that I still struggle with this type of anger that is often directed with the attitude of unfairness or cynicism or victimisation, that really caught my attention.

I must admit - as much as I really hate it and it annoys me, victimisation feels addicting and it is almost empowering for the most pity and sympathy you will get. 

There are moments I want to victimise myself without realising it and ""find an excuse"" for this victimization by saying that I was treated unfairly. I do understand that many people are oppressed and will end up feeling angry for such injustices but over time, I later learned that I have to be responsible for my own actions and process these thoughts accordingly.

And I noticed that while I still struggle with some form of anger or I have this occasional dose of paranoia and cynicism that makes me think that I am about to become a conspiracy theorist, I realise that before, I used to actually think like this at a much greater level.

And to some extent, I do believe that those who actively behave in ways are akin to conspiracy theorists, or terrorists or just being plain arrogant, I think I can understand where this stems from - a lot of unprocessed emotions and insecurities that are projected to someone else, possibly as a side-effect of some troubled upbringing or trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

A part of me says that this cynicism is sound. If my life mostly involved being warped and twisted in ways that make me so hateful and angry towards the world and think that it is about to get me, it is no wonder I have this survival instinct to think of the worst and think of anything that can happen even if it may not be real because the mind is a very cunning thing if you are not careful.

Truth to be told, there is some logic to this as well because if you dig deeper into this, you will realise that injustices did and still exist in some shape or form. There are ones that are even on a governmental level or a nation-wide level and ones that were either done in secret or ones that people know to exist but some people got away with it for whatever reason - whether it was power, money, influence and so on.

So obviously, when combined with this warped idea that the world is a cold and cruel place, especially knowing that I was raised in that type of environment that eventually shaped this kind of reality in me, this eventually leads to some very unhealthy thinking and ones that will be very difficult to tackle because they go keep into your core and affect your primal instincts and how you feel about yourself and the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying that people who are terrorists or conspiracy theorists or whatever are excused. If people break the law or harm others or try to spread information that is not real or twisted or want to manipulate or influence people to push a certain agenda that is based on a very passionate and possibly immoral attitude, then of course, this will lead to its own consequences.

We have many arguments in philosophy, psychology, political theory and even history that delve into this and they tell us how this type of thinking will have its own repercussions.

But I will not lie ... whenever I see these people or hear their claims, I am more inclined to ask why they think like this or understand where these ideas are stemming from instead of neglecting them entirely and calling them ""fools""",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713586,public,self,"After reflecting on my abusive upbringing, I think that I was very close to being a conspiracy theorist or a terrorist or a narcissist who hates the world and I think that this is why I do not like to label conspiracy theories or similar groups as ""idiotic"" and can empathise more.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p7d91t/after_reflecting_on_my_abusive_upbringing_i_think/,some_ads,7,supporturgent,b4c5598c-82c9-11e3-9642-12313d27e9a3,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

My mom who is ALWAYS commenting on what I eat (and is probably the reason why I don't have the healthiest relationship with food - although they don't know) said that ""pasta and eggs shouldn't be eaten together"".

I think I strained my eye muscles from rolling my eyes too much. I'm 26 and I'm healthy, honestly who cares if I have one egg after eating pasta? I looked for support from my dad saying ""ugh is it that important if I eat one egg after pasta...?"" but he, as always, didn't say anything and left the room.

""Proteins and carbs together will make you sick"", she says. (Uhhh I don't think just that will make me sick, and even if it happens, I'll remember it for next time and avoid that food combination).

I said ""I don't care about what your beliefs around food are, so stop commenting"".
Her: ""They're not beliefs, it's what it is!! Eggs and pasta don't go together, you can't eat them in the same meal!!"".
Me: ""I don't care, so stop commenting"".
Her: ""It's not about what you care, proteins and carbs don't go together!"".
Me: ""And I don't care about your comments. Do I talk about finance to you..?""
Her: ""It's normal comments, just like talking about the weather!!"".
Me: ""I don't care, stop commenting"".

This time she stopped but only because she was going to rest in the afternoon. Usually she goes on and on forever and I have to go to my bedroom to get some peace.

But how do I make her stop entirely? It's ALWAYS like this, almost at every meal and at everything I do in general.

I'm 38 now and it really hurts that the deep connection I've always dreamed having with her was all a lie. 

 I found out a couple weeks ago she's been cheating on her husband ( they met 23 years ago in high school) the entire time with at least 5 different men. She decided to leave him (because he doesn't impress her work friends?!?) And get a divorce because he's boring and doesn't help around the house (which were lies). Not two days after she coerced him into getting a vasectomy so she would have sex with him again (because she already ruined her body popping out 3 kids) she hooked up with some guy on a work trip. She's never been truthful with me (all the lies started becoming apparent because if this) but I suspected she was cheating so I just happened to ask after she decided to move out. She was bragging about this guy and claiming she's so excited for me to meet him! 
I've had a pretty deep platonic connection with her husband since they met, but she was feeding both of us lies about how shitty the other was which kept us from pursuing our friendship all these years (she though I was a slut and would fuck him?!?). We recently reconnected as he's been pursuing his spirituality/manhood through yoga and meditation. I encouraged him and even read a few books to discuss with him. This infuriated her! She would be cold when I came over and even bitched at us for talking during a shitty kids TV show we had put on for our kids ( husband later explained ""she likes to check out mentally at night and we disturbed that...like wtf?). 
The real kicker for me is when I told her about a house my husband and I just bought in January that wasn't going to be ready until end of this month ( yay just 2 more weeks). She literally had no reaction! Totally flat and avoidant. I learned later that she blew up on her ex demanding they renovate their house ( a 70s model in the best neighborhood in our city) saying they never gave anything nice and she's sick of living in this shitty house. The icing on the cake is that I realize she had wanted to leave him the last few years but now she kicked it into high gear trying to find a man to monkey branch to. 
After announcing she was divorcing a few weeks ago she couldn't kick her husband out so she immediately got a new luxury 2br  apartment and moved out ( conveniently before my house was ready...). She rented a truck and completely trashed the house,, taking all her shit (she'd basically hoarded a hobby lobby at this point shutting the family out) without any regard to what her kids thought was theirs). She plans on having half custody of her 3 kids, 2 girls 1 boy age 3-8, in that 1 extra bedroom. ""Relax, I'm happy now so they'll be fine!!"" Her psychopathy baffles me! 
It broke my heart hearing my nieces say ""mommy took all my makeup and paints.."" I started hearing about the abusive episodes right before they split up, she proudly admitted them herself. ""I locked my daughter in a dog cage I the basement for two hours because she kept waking me up at night saying she's scared. Thank God she doesn't complain anymore."" She spent her sons kid birthday party getting smashed and complaining how dense husband was. She didn't even acknowledge him and even dumped her kids off on me and disappeared. When her son and husband wanted to stay longer she went home and locked the bedroom door forcing husband to sleep in the basement. Even though she portrays herself as an awesome laid back mom (they raise themselves right?!?) She's literally never had the kids by herself for more than a day and husband actually did a majority of the childcare behind closed doors ("" he never helps around the house all he does is play with kids""). He wanted her to do one week by herself before she took custody and she flat out refused. Even though she has supposed half custody the kids basically have just done weekends with her. 
I'm disgusted and shocked by all this as she brushes it off as being the best time in her life (she's finally free!!). I also realized she's been trying to convince me my husband's a lazy controlling worthless piece of shit (which he's not) for the whole 13 years of our relationship. I almost did leave, but thank God u have enough humility to apologize for my shitty behavior.

About a year ago, all their emotional and verbal abuse came to light and I realised that I was abused throughout my childhood/growing up. 

I decided to not kiss their ass anymore and became LC. Subsequently, it is likely that I won’t be receiving the inheritance, and it’s been difficult for me to come to terms with that as I had thought I’d be financially well all my life.

But we argue sometimes and she says the most evil things, even if we make up, we could be having a nice conversation and some narc type thing is slipped in and it makes my heart ache so much. How can she be so loving and nice but also have such shitty opinions and words sometimes?

I probably haven’t explained this very well but I’m wondering if anyone is in the same situation? She hurts me so much and I think why it hurts more is because she can be so loving at times

to put it more in context, my mother has extremely narcissistic behaviors, she has never been emotionally present or has even tried to be, whenever i have tried to open up to her it has ended badly, very badly. basically any problem of mine, it has to be about her. last year i struggled a lot with anxiety but the only thing that she managed to do was to yell at me and threaten me to put me in a mental hospital. i also used to have panic attacks very frequently until one day she exploded and started throwing things at me screaming about how much of a disappointment i was to her and that i basically ruined her vacations. not to mention the other day she did the same thing because i almost fainted at school and made her wait a little too long in the parking lot. my mom tends to have many of these violent outbursts, in which she threatens to kill herself, among other things and honestly i really want to go live with my dad but i’m afraid that she’ll actually kill herself if i do so (she has already tried in the past) she also tends to be very bipolar when it comes to giving love. in that sense, i always felt that i should beg for it, do things to deserve it and until now i realize that this isn’t normal, at least in a parent. how do you even deal with a mother like this?

I do have NParents, but this is more of a support-seeking post for all of my issues and not just that one, since I don't think I could separate them even if I tried. I'm a little bit desperate to be heard and to find someone to talk to so I hope it's okay this once.

I feel so completely broken that I'm not sure where to begin in asking for help. I have been through things that I would never wish on anyone and I'm running out of ways to cope that won't put me in the ground. When talking to a friend stopped working years ago, I turned to self-injury. That stopped working, so I turned to flat-out denial. From there, it became promiscuity. And then drugs, and then alcohol, and then more severe self-injury and now harder drugs. I'm realizing that I'm going to die if I don't help myself, and despite many years of suicidal impulses and fantasies, the thought of dying on any terms other than my own is terrifying.

I've been through many professionals. I have a loving boyfriend and one or two patient friends. No family, though. And I think the two things that I desperately need, which have been missing from everything I've tried and failed to find comfort in in the past, are (a) a person who understands on a personal level because they've been there, and (b) a person who has that whole maternal, protective thing that I've never gotten to experience. I can't recall a time in my entire life that I've felt protected, even as a young child, and I think it may help me give a shit about saving my own life to believe that I'm valuable enough to someone to be worth protecting.

If anyone at all feels like talking, I would be very grateful. I just ask that you be woman-identified, non-religious, and non-judgmental of the things I've had to do in order to survive.

My abusive parent was beating my 17 year old sibling for playing games overnight, and talking with her friends. Found pitiful reasons like ""you are burning our electricity bills!"" to add to the story, while I was catching her hands in the air, or how ""disrespectful"" my sister's replies were. An abrupt awakening for sure. My heart was basically shaking in my chest, as I tried to calm the spirits down and find some words to take my mom's head off the matter. She wasn't letting up.  
In fact, she got so aggressive again, that for the first time, I had to repeatedly push and restrain her out of a room. I locked the door behind me to be sure. She then went to insult me, tell me how she's going to get a lawyer to get me kicked out of the house (23 year old undergrad in my final year), and she proceeded to hit me on the chest a couple of times. Then, crying, she let up, and walked to her room while sobbing how our presence is destroying her life, how we made her our slave etc.   


I've never seen her like this. Yes, our fights can get really bad, but this time, she behaved like a clinical patient. Like an animal that just wanted to get inside a cage to jump on her prey.  She really likes making my sister the center of her problems, and lets out all her rage on my sibling.  And the more she does it, the bigger the rebellious spirit of my sister grows. Right now, for the Nth time, she's threatening to oust us from the house.   
I dared her to take every means available to her to do so, and called my entire family to update them on the situation. I consider it somewhat scummy to try and ""recruit"" people to my side, but I honestly do not feel safe with this woman anymore. I want to have some net of safety and backing from people I trust.

I am in a tough spiral of self doubt right now, and think i might need some advice. So, here is some context: my mother, who has strong narcissistic, and BPD traits, but has never been formally diagnosed, kicked me (21M) out. We have been in a cycle for 3 years where she would threaten me every few months that i will have to move out. This always happened spontaneously, and she was very unplanned in that regard. More so 'get out, i can't take it anymore'. Now the thing is, i'm definitely guilty of a lot of things. For instance, even though never teaching me how to do it, she wanted me to do things around the house, and there were a lot of cases were i didnt do that, sometimes out of spite, often out of laziness. She also wanted me to get a proper job, which i also didn't. This had more to do with being lazy and also depressed most of the time. Now the thing is, she says her reason for kicking me out was that i didn't do better, even though promising i would. This makes me unsure if she really abused me, or if she was reacting to my obnoxiousness. It would give me some peace to know that i didn't deserve what happened and that i wasn't the villain.

 Hi. 

I am mainly writing to apologise for not honouring your desire to keep knowledge of your personal life from me. I have known for years that you felt uncomfortable with mum and the twins telling me things about you and your life. I had many excuses and reasons why I thought it was okay, but I've realised now, that none of those reasons are good enough. 

So I'm setting that boundary now with mum and the twins, asking then not to tell me anything you tell them about yourself. 

\*brother\* told me you were in hospital, so it was hard to not want to find out more, because of my concern for your well-being, but also I want to be able to talk \*brother through things like that. \*grandma\* , \*brother\* and \*sister\* all talk to me about everything in their lives, and because you mean a lot to them, it's natural for them to also want to talk about you sometimes. 

But I want to honour your right to privacy, as that is a basic human right and you deserve that. So I do really apologise for all the times over the years when I have listened to, asked questions and discussed aspects of your life you probably really wish I didn't know about. 

I'm sorry.

It's essentially a journal documenting mostly kid-exchanges from an early year in their divorce, taking me through kindergarten to first grade. It may have been the first real year in which my dad started having visitations longer than an afternoon. I'm not sure if ""visitation journals"" are court-ordered or if my mom thought she was being legally savvy or what. The super weird part is that the journaling starts about halfway through, with a bunch of blank pages beforeit.

Basically, the entire year it's just talking about how my sibling and I would get sick after we visited my dad and then my mom would blame it on his negligence. Or she'd say we were sick when we went to his house and he didn't take care of us properly \[this isn't always untrue--he once tried to force me on a two-day roadtrip when I was projectile vomiting from stomach flu, and he left my sibling and me at home for a church meeting while I was sick and we were too young to be alone\]. 

Occasional cringe: she said she passed by my dad's house on the way home from work \[his house was *not* on her way home from work\] and saw us unaccompanied on the sidewalk. Once she said she left a note on his car.  I don't know if such things were more normal in the time before e-mail and texting, but her boundaries seemed off to me.

There were a few times when things she said rang true. In one, my mom was frustrated my dad wasn't offering his two cents on how to approach an illness we had and he said, ""You were the one who decided to get the divorce, you get to figure all these things out yourself."" He made lots of cold/flippant remarks like that growing up. There was another statement about a school play and how my dad attended and I waved, but he never came up to say hello. Presumably, he was avoiding my mom. She also remarked he didn't come to school to see me off on the first day of first grade and that I *never* asked where he was. Did I expect him to see me off? We weren't a family anymore. Why would both be there?

I'm not sure how much these illnesses were normal-kids-at-germy-school illnesses, how much was a hovering Nmom exaggerating to make my dad look bad, and how much was the trauma of two kids being tossed around between warring parents and not having support for emotional pain so it manifests as feeling ill instead.

But like... and forgive my language... why *the fuck* was this in the box my mom had set aside for me?

Is it wrong for me to be upset that she'd put something so steeped in so much childhood trauma in a box meant for me? Like what purpose would this serve other than to manipulate me into feeling sorry for her or hating my dad?

If anything I just feel more resentful than ever of my parents for not worrying how these antics would damage my sibling and me. They have--deeply.

Basically I have been narcissistically abused for 24 years and didn’t even know. 

I am extremely trauma bonded to my mom and can’t stop obsessing about her and the future. For years now I have feared the future and not being able to get out because fear has literally programmed into my brain. By my parents. I would try to escape during fights and would have nowhere to go. My power was stripped from me again and again, my sense of hope and sense of self diminishing to almost nothing.

I am afraid. I’m not even angry. I am severely afraid and have been for the majority of my life (getting worse in later years).

I want to call her up right now and bask in the shallow empathy or even the angry insults that she hurls at me. Even her anger is comforting sometimes as long as she gives me some attention. That’s how sick it is.

I took my first dose of Zoloft today and I think it is making my anxiety worse. I am completely isolated and don’t have any close friends or family who I can find strength/seek solace with. I recently met one friend but we aren’t close and she’s not picking up the phone.

I am imagining a future where I am disabled, or disabled by an illness where they don’t give you disability and having to rely solely on narc mom. I already have fibromyalgia which has been flaring after realizing what has been going on.

My mind is really a mess right now. I need peace, comfort, hope, positivity. But all I am feeling is fear. Not even anger, just extreme fear.

Without this fear I could move on and never look back. I have savings, 3 years of experience in the childcare industry, and a relatively healthy body as of today.

This fear is literally wrecking my mind and body - fight or flight, can barely eat or sleep, extreme fear of the future. I keep on thinking what is narc mom going to do? 

Thing is, she doesn’t have to even lift a finger anymore - I will self sabotage my way to death or under her grip again.

How do I stay strong when all I’ve known is fear and weakness?

My therapist told me to not reveal what I’m feeling to my mom, but for my whole life she has been the person I go to with my fears, even though she was the one culturing and reinforcing them, feeding them all along.

Please send me strength! I really need it tonight. I feel like I’m going through severe drug withdrawals and craving that drug more than ever.

My parents were in the room so we were basically alone. When he showed it to me, he kept asking me to touch it with a rushed sort of aggressive “hurry up before I get caught” tone. I refused to touch it so he zipped up his pants and we headed back to the living room. I don’t remember what happened after that. The thought of what would have happened if I touched it lingers at the back of my mind, and has for years. I am still underage and my brother is an adult now who Is currently in jail, but not for any sexual related cases. He gets out of jail next year in February. I still have a chance to tell my family, but with the way our dynamic is set out, I already know who’s gonna take who’s side. Everyone will turn against me. They’re already against me anyways. Telling them this will only add fuel to the fire. I can imagine them now saying things like  “it’s your fault.” “you allowed it”. “Why didn’t you say this earlier” “you’re lying” “you’re sick.“ And I definitely can’t let my therapist know about this. The fact that I also have a little sister who has been around him multiple times, alone, also makes me feel worse about myself. He could have did the same to her and it would have been my fault.…right ? 

I kept it a secret for years cause I can’t bear to know what will happen if I speak up. I also blame myself sometimes because before that even happened, there were events leading up to it. Somehow when I was 6 I was sexually excited and curious in that way, and sadly I used that energy to experiment with my brother in ways that I shouldn’t have, in ways that I feel guilty about till this day. I used to pull my panties down and let him smack my butt and rub on it and I actually liked it. I feel sick looking back at the behavior I used to accept from myself, but I still don’t know who’s fault it was. I was about 6 or 7, but either way it goes, he is 6 years older than me. 

Was this sexual abuse ? Was it curiosity ? Am I over exaggerating ? I always wonder if he remembers too. Because all these years it’s been on the back of my mind but I’m not sure if it’s been on his the same way. How can you just forget about that ? I thought it wasn’t a big deal at first but the more and more I look back at it, I realize it was. And I just don’t know if this is traumatic or not considering that I…engaged in it with him ? I don’t know. Long after that event we have been around each other, and he had never “sexually abused“ me after that. It happened once. But we did not have a good relationship before he went to jail 2 years ago.

It’s embarrassing. Period. 

Around her “boyfriend” (the one who lied about being married), she wears this fake goofy smile on her face and prances around the house like she’s 15. It’s weird. Asf. She’ll be EXTRA nice to me too. She’ll ask me if I want chips, I’ll say yes and she’ll come home with 2 boxes of chips and put a sticky note with my name and a heart on the top. Like seriously. It’s cringe how hard she has to try and keep up this fake image, to people that could hardly give a f* about her. I could go on and on with examples.

I wish she could just wake up! And see herself from the outside in.

Perhaps as a result of some of the abuse by my grandmother, my mother (70f) has some problematic issues that she refuses to get help for. When I was a teenager, she became a gambling addict. She is a pathological liar; she lies about things that don’t matter and things that matter a lot. She was also a lifetime smoker and now has lung cancer (which is luckily being managed) but getting accurate health information from her is damn near impossible unless I visit her provider with her. On top of the lying and the gambling, she is a martyr. All of these terrible things always happen to her despite her never doing anything wrong. 

She refuses to see a therapist or get help for her gambling addiction. She only quit smoking because the other option was dying. Being around her is really challenging for me. We recently had extended family in town and I had a really rough time listening to the lies and the martyrdom.

I am a 20 year old male college student and I live at home with both my parents. My mom is not the toxic one, my dad is. My whole life I’ve always sought out approval from both of them. Over time, the approval came naturally from my mom but my dad would always have a hard time with that. 

Anything that is going well for me in life is always rained down with his constant negativity and pessimism. I can never truly be at ease when I’m alone with him in a car ride for example. I always feel like I have to have my guard up in conversations because he will talk about something in MY life and find some way to sprinkle some negativity in it making me question myself. I’ve always had to ask for permission to go out (even now at 20 years old) and he’s starting to say I don’t have to anymore. But I still feel the need to hear him say “yes”. I think this is a byproduct of the many years of control he’s had over me. 

I am tired of his toxic behaviors and I want to free myself from him and my need for his approval once and for all. Of course it will be hard since I see him everyday because I live at home.

For example: when I had appendicitis I ended up laying on the bathroom floor after becoming violently ill. I had to beg my mom to take me to the er and she only agreed after I told her she could take the money out of my college fund. She claimed that she only knew I wasn’t faking because I offered to pay. She was also chronically guilty of medical neglect and dental neglect. All this to say: the medical care I received because of my moms selfishness was significantly worse than average. 

In first grade (2006), I got a sinus infection. It was hurting me badly and I knew something was wrong because it sounded like I had pop rocks in my nose. My mom told me I was faking it to get out of school - until it spread to my chest. I was hospitalized because X-rays showed that I had an acute lung infection and I was relying on multiple nebulizer treatments a day. A side effect they didn’t catch during this hospitalization was a protein deposit left by the infection. This deposit is sitting on my triageminal nerve and has caused a condition called triageminal neuralgia -which is regarded as the most painful condition you can have. I suffered from this condition from 2006-2020 without any treatment and only went to the doctor when my college roommate and her mom noticed that I was suffering from symptoms which didn’t align with plain migraines. I now take heavy dosages of anti convulsants and nerve pain medications to deal with the pain. I want to hate my mom for what she did to me. 

In 2020, I cut my mom off entirely and used the pandemic to justify my absence. I thought it would be the end of the issue and I could focus on healing. Around Christmas, my little brother (the golden child) pointed out that our mom has never treated me “like a person” and, for whatever reason, this resonated with our mom. She began reaching out to check on me and buying me gifts - even when it wasn’t a holiday. She has told me she wants to rebuild our relationship and a part of me does agree- if only because I want just one parent (my dad died in 2009)- but the other part of me can’t forgive her. I don’t know if it’s because she won’t accept that her medical neglect had lasting consequences but I assume a part of the issue is just that she won’t accept that I need an apology to move foreword.

Guess a priest is saying mass and musicians are playing in an empty fucking room at my expense. 

My Nbrother is a literal psychopath. He's been violent with me and stalked me in the past and is the reason I've moved to the opposite end of the country. I've worked very hard to hide myself from him. 

My family was so upset that my brother had to have mom's ashes, but wouldn't do a service for her. Wouldn't give her ashes to someone who would. 
It was a gigantic fucking deal. Huge. 
I wasn't going to get involve for my own sanity, but it was such a big deal that I made the mistake of getting involved. I called around. A lot of the churches wouldn't do a mass without her ashes, but I explained the very unusual situation and one decided to cut us some slack and make an exception. 
My family praised me, saying what a good job I'm doing...
But then everyone started acting funny. They wouldn't answer my calls and now no one knows who's going. 

If you would have spoken to my family a couple of days ago, at least five local people who were fully vaxxed were going if it wasn't for my damned brother. 

With literally no one wanting to go, now everyone is pointing fingers at me, wondering why I'm now going to my own mother's funeral. 

Fuck them. 

I'm not risking my damn safety, going to a disclosed location in the same state as my brother a couple miles from his house when he's so fucking amped up about inheritance shit. 

Not to mention, COVID

This funeral is happening and no one is going to fucking be there. It's going to be the saddest fucking thing in the world.

It hadn’t occurred to me until then because after years of being blamed and shamed, I had come to learn that I was the problem in our relationship. He’s always been extremely controlling and growing up, he used his authority of being the only man in the house and being a police officer to his advantage. Since therapy, I’ve learned to establish boundaries (thanks to subreddits like this!!) and have since spent less and less time around him. The fact of the matter is, him and my mom are still together so I often go home to visit. She and I have a great relationship and I honestly wish she divorced him years ago. However, she is the enabler and the type of woman who allows herself to get walked all over. It’s a parental recipe for disaster. 

Even though I am 32 years old, married, have a solid job, have my own mortgage and am financially independent, my dad takes every opportunity to treat me like a child - ironically only when my husband isn’t around. Today, I was at my parents’ house without my husband and he raised his voice at me for not wearing socks in the house (he doesn’t like the marks bare feet leave his on floors). Just typing that out seems absolutely ludicrous but I’m sure everyone reading this can sympathize with the ridiculous of this. I calmly told him I would put my socks on and that all he had to do was ask nicely, that he didn’t have to yell at me like I was a child. 

That completely set him off. He started yelling even more talking about rules I set at my condo but then I don’t abide by his in his house. I decided it was time to leave and remove myself from the situation. I packed up my things, waved goodbye and said I was going to head home. My mom was sad and my dad burst into a hysteric screaming episode saying I was being ridiculous. I calmly stated I was setting my boundaries and distancing myself since I didn’t want to be talked to like that. That’s when he blew a gasket and screamed “Now you’re just being a BITCH.” As soon as those words came out of his mouth, I knew I was making the right decision. Because he lost the control of treating me that way and talking down to me, it made him angrier. 

I have to go back there this weekend as my sister is coming into town for her bridal shower and am unsure of how to go about this situation. He texted me today justifying his behavior first before apologizing and saying that bitch just “slipped.” The fact he reacted with that much hostility and emotional abuse over me leaving deeply disturbs me though and I’m heavily considering going NC but am wrestling with it since I don’t want my relationship with my mom to suffer. Would love any and all advice/thoughts.

toxic patterns, repeated behaviors, etc etc. All of it slowly but surely revealing the true “me” I always felt was somehow buried as an ACoN remaining in contact (aka: an adult continuing to be abused).

At first, NC was euphoric. Then came very difficult bouts of grief, depression, anger, sadness, and second guessing my decision. I held strong throughout each “season”, and I’m self aware enough to realize I will likely cycle back to *all* of these emotions again at some point.

It makes my skin crawl when she finds her way into my life. I have not physically seen her for 2 years and I stopped giving her personal information recently. I have been working towards NC. She hacked my amazon account to observe my purchases and then sent me things that I was just browsing and wasn't actually interested in buying or things I had saved. She found my private goodreads page, which was a safe haven, and sent me books on my wishlist. Someone I thought was my childhood friend was actually her informant. She was pretending to be my special needs sister and texting me to get personal information. My sister is precious to me and I can't see her without my nmom or ndad being involved. My other sister follows in her footsteps as well. She sent me a picture of a cozy mystery section at the bookstore when I have never told her I like that genre. I would have been nice to connect and bond with her by telling her my interests... 

I have been looking for a job and found one recently. During this process, I finally decided to block my nmom. When I was going through therapy, the therapist told me I should I set boundaries with her... Horrible idea. Now she knows my pressure points. So all of her texts are either crossing my boundaries or trying to convince me that I am crazy rather than admitting how messed up my family is. That is the narrative, that I am emotionally unstable and the crazy one who needs therapy while they are all stable individuals. My inbox is flooded with job search emails that I did not sign up for. She has done this in the past, where she will use my email or address to subscribe to  services without my permission. The disturbing part is, I have successfully kept my goals and aspirations from her out of necessity. She has a way of ruining the things I'm passionate about. But she found out. She somehow knows exactly what I'm interested in. How? I thought I had checked all my bases. I am states away, I have blocked any communication, and yet still she slims her way into my life. 

It feels like no one believes me or people think I'm paranoid when I talk about how creepy my parents are and how fucked up they are. This isn't even the messed up part of all she has done and let my ndad do to me. They give me that look of, ""come one there really isn't anyone THAT evil in this world.""

I don't think my mom is a narcissist, but her mother definitely was and it definitely fucked her up. I had basically no relationship with my grandmother as a result and I think it was the right call on my mom's part. Her mother died 15 years ago and now that I'm in my 30s I've started to recognize that a lot of what drives me crazy about my mom's behavior can be traced to what happened to her. 

When I first learned the word parentification it was a lighting bolt moment because it summed up a lot of what went on when I was younger and what happened to my mom. My mom was undoubtedly parentified and I think it emotionally stunted her. Besides being abusive my grandmother was also an extremely brittle diabetic so my mom would often come home to find her mother passed out and have to revive her and my grandmother was apparently verbally abusive during this. There are countless stories like this but it's clear their relationship wasn't good and getting away from her mother was the best thing that ever happened to my mom to the point of moving to the opposite side of the country where she met my dad and had me.

Now me. There's that joke about ""if you were called an old soul you're on at least one anti depressant now"" which made me laugh in Lexapro and Wellbutrin. I very much was and everyone commented on it and by the time I was a teenager my mom seemed to not think of me as actually being a child, so I got put into the position of unpaid therapist since she and my dad were having marital problems at the time. Adult me realizes how wildly inappropriate it was but teenage me thought she was mature enough to handle it and said it was okay at the time. Adult me gets that teenage me wasn't even capable of making that call at the time and my mom should have known better than to put me in that situation. 

Well... maybe not so much on the last part. Because I wonder if she really didn't realize that wasn't okay for her to do to me since her mom used her the exact same way.  I've spent a lot of time working on now establishing boundaries and telling my mom that she can't use me as her unpaid therapist anymore but I still wonder exactly what her level of responsibility is here.

I say something like “there’s plenty of space I don’t know why he’s freaking out” to my sister.

My dad just takes the bottles out of the fridge and says “just for that.” 

I’m annoyed but not starting anything. 

My sister says “it’s his house… his money… his water blah blah”

I get mad and say something stupid like “then you do it, bitch.” Which doesn’t make any sense and yeah I shouldn’t have called her a bitch but it is an ongoing nice little thing for her to constantly bring up that dad is the bread winner and make me out to be spoiled FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING. AS SIMPLE AS FUCKING WATER. Like damn, didn’t realize I’m not entitled to basic needs.

Dad just starts screaming as he always does and tells me I’m acting like an a hole and he is going to throw me out on the streets. “I’m tired of this shit.” (What he always says when I stick up for myself and hurt his feewings :( by not letting him own me.)

I can’t think of one adult women that my mom didn’t shit talk.

“Girls gossip. Girls are mean. Girls will hurt you. Girls will leave you. You’re not enough. You have to do more.”

She had very strict ideas about what it took to be a good woman, and no woman could measure up, including myself. 

“It’s a good thing we dressed you well for your choir concert, all of the other (3rd graders) were dressed like little hookers.” “I know you like that shirt, but you can’t wear it with that jacket, brown and black aren’t colors that mix well, and the other girls will laugh at you.” “Oh that (insert woman’s/girls name here) is such an (insert insulting word here) who probably (insert bad behavior here).”

I think my mom wanted to be the only woman in my life and was jealous of me spending time with other girls.

This made me insanely nervous to talk to girls, and had I exclusively male friends. I didn’t feel like a girl, I couldn’t relate to them, I expected them to hate me.

Later in life, I started going through puberty and realized I was really attracted to girls. From that point on, I became a flustered blushing mess whenever I talked to girls my age. This made it impossible to have relationships with women at all. I ended up marrying a great guy, because I like boys too, and that guy knows I’m bi and says he’s okay with me flirting with girls.

Even thinking about flirting with a girl makes me nervous and sweaty and like a teenager with a first crush. But I still have this deep seeded fear that women will reject and hate me. All my fantasies end with a girl realizing I’m not enough and leaving. It’s heartbreaking.

I want to explore my sexuality, but I’m terrified of doing so. It’s a difficult spot to be in.

Everything is about ridiculing what we do, what we eat, mocking us. My husband stopped responding to him eventually.

Rumor has it from my mom and before that, my aunt (his sister), that when he was growing up into post college, he would scare my grandma so badly, yelling at her, that she would hide in the basement.

My childhood was incredibly loud, and he still does not believe a word I say; he confirms everything with my husband. If I say he can't visit, he still will show up. He will disregard me because I'm a woman and he doesn't respect or believe me. I'm 31.

I have never seen a yearly income of $30,000 or above and I have a business/marketing degree. I also studied design and was heavily discouraged and competed against by my family. I wound up marrying a very talented designer and my brother tried to completely switch careers to go work at a design agency. He also tried to rip off my husband's design that he created from scratch and my Mother thinks he is an angel. My entire family competes with us and we were not supported by my parents when we got engaged. My mother took my wedding dress and claims she lost it... she has taken other things that belonged to me too. AND, she literally went through some of the wedding gifts and wouldn't allow me to take some of the gifts home. Later she gave me some weird distorted answer saying she thought my husband opened them which made NO sense. My mother has told family members NOT to call me, when I told her to leave me alone and she took it as her mission to tell people to not contact me. I can't prove that they control things but at this moment I have 0 savings, 0 money in the bank and am living in their house with our child WITHOUT my husband due to covid because .... wait for it... they claim that the house is too small and my husband can't stay here. So now we are living like a divorced couple and my husband is not even allowed to stay over or hardly even come over. He doesn't get to see his child, yet they are practically raising her. They told people my husband was a drunk after he was sent to the ER for having a complete break down and vitamin deficiency. They snubbed him and somehow tried to drive wedge between us but all these things I can not pin point and I feel like I am going crazy. I wish I could prove everything. My Dad is HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE.

Unfortunately, people do not think of other people as victims of abuse, unless they can come up with one single shocking traumatic event. Story of my life. 

Sorry for the long post, I already tried to shorten it and left many things out. 

Here are some of the things/behaviors that happened throughout my childhood (in no particular order).

My mom is a hoarder and has had very weird, intense, uncontrollable temper tantrums. Sometimes she would walk through our apartment, pulling her hair and punching herself in the head while screaming. Sometimes we had to wade through trash, and we had a lot of rotten and spoiled food at home, some of which was served to us. I had an eating disorder as a child and have never been too fond of eating to this day. She would sing uncontrollably and very loud in the kitchen, like a maniac, and my friends who came to visit would get scared. It was like in a mental hospital, really. My mom and my dad would regularly get into violent fights, sometimes involving kitchen knives, food or furniture being thrown at each other. Many things in our household were destroyed in my childhood and everyone took part in it. There is still a hole in the kitchen door today, from when my mom threw a knife at my dad.

My dad was an alcoholic and chain-smoker, he also smoked inside. He often drove me around when he was very drunk and kept talking to me about how he would die soon. We were in bad accidents (one time the car spun over and landed on its roof on the highway), he lost his driver's license etc. at that time I didn’t care if I would die.

When I was 6 years old, he locked himself in the bathroom and announced to kill himself. I was crying outside, knocking at the door, begging him not to do it. This haunted me for many years.

My dad often used to disappear when he would go outside to run some errands and returned late in the night, sometimes with blood on his face from falling over. Sometimes he got into fights or the police would bring him home (even though he was never violent towards us). It was very embarrassing, since all our neighbors and many of my friends who lived in the same street were witness to it. My dad caused some very embarrassing situations, some of which I don’t want to mention here. He was always in debt and personified chaos.

For more than a decade and a half, my parents had very aggressive, vulgar (South Park got nothing on my parents and I learned as a baby how to seriously cuss) and frightening fights (for us as children) on a daily basis.

My mom would send us (around 5 and10 year old siblings) around the neighborhood to go look for my dad, even if it was in the middle of the night. One Christmas my dad disappeared, when he was out to go and get a Christmas tree. She sent us to look for him. We were scared to death and roaming the neighborhood looking for him holding hands. We found his car two subway stations away and he was in the trunk, so drunk that his eyes were rolled back. We dragged him back home and got ridiculed for it by people passing by. Well he got ridiculed, but we were ashamed to death. It really left a mark on us. Situations like this happened regularly. That day Christmas died for me and I have never liked it ever since. My mom never breastfed me and was very proud of it.  

She once told me when I was little: “Never make the same mistake as me and have children”. My sister (5 years older) used to change my diapers when I was a baby. She told me that I had rashes from my parents not changing my diapers for days. We never had any kind of connection, from the beginning.

As mentioned, my mom used to engage in very bizarre and odd behavior. Here are some examples: When we would take a shower, she would always use the hot water in the kitchen, which would turn the water ice cold in the bath tub. Every.single.time. Over many years. My sister and me used to get very mad at her for this, because it was so annoying. She would always have us wait at the lunch table for at least 15 -20 minutes when food was already served and complain (violently and aggressively) if we already started eating and would also always make sure that she took 20 minutes more than us, after each of us finished. And we always had to wait for her. During vacations or daytrips, she would always walk at least 50 meters behind us and every time we would stop to wait for her, she would stop and wait until we would continue walking. Sometimes we lost her. One time she got robbed by a pickpocket and we screamed and gesticulated at her from afar, that someone was opening her purse. She stuck her fingers in her ears, as she would always do, when someone said something she didn’t want to hear. She always complained about everything and everyone being too loud but it was her who was screaming in a very annoying and aggressive way. All the time.  She stole 10,000 $ which my dad saved for me starting when I was born, wasted it and lies to this day about it to me. My sister received the money. She liked my sister a little bit better than me and supported her in her career, while everything I was ever doing was stupid, senseless and I am not good enough for anything. She didn’t like men very much and any kind of affection for that matter. She never told me that she loved me or showed any affection (my dad was able to do that, despite his fuckups). Harsh criticism that borders (and sometimes involved hatred) and no affection or reassurance ever for me. I was her biggest mistake. 

She had vulgar explosions of anger that remind me of the movie The Exorcist. Really, you wouldn’t believe it, if you saw her. My wife didn’t believe me, until she saw it herself. Nobody knows she is like this, besides us. The rest of the world thinks she is a very nice and kind lady and they don’t understand what is wrong with me and why I am not thankful for this nice little lady. When my dad got terminally ill with cancer, she used to beat him up. He wasn’t able to defend himself anymore because he was slowly on the way out. Every time she demanded something stupid or ridiculous of me and I wouldn’t oblige, she would beat him up. I would get a call by him, begging me to comply with her will next time, because otherwise she would beat him up again. It made me angry like you wouldn’t believe, which didn’t make the situation better. One time I caught her attacking him and grabbed her by the collar. I told her that I would knock her the fuck out, if she ever touched my dad again, who was very very ill. I am not proud of it, but I was sooo angry. 

I never went hungry (well, let me correct myself, she always used to cook very small portions, because she thought eating too much isn't good, so often times I left the lunch table hungry. Later when I would visit them I ate in advance, knowing she would either cook very little or something disgusting. To this day, when I cook, I compulsively cook too much, always having that fear in mind to go to bed hungry), had toys, went on some nice vacations, but it still messed me up that it is affecting me to this day. My mom isn’t an inherently evil person and she has some good in her, she just never loved me and always used me as her punching bag with no mercy. I have had huge issues regarding women for a very long time.

My dad died 10 years ago, my mom is still alive. I feel indifferent towards her and I feel sorry for her. But I don’t love her. What are your thoughts on this?

My mom was an asshole growing up who always criticized everything I did, who was always cold towards me, compared me to others, etc. I was never capable enough, didn’t work hard enough, wasn’t mature enough, etc. But, most of all, I was never enough of a good person. There was always this theme in our relationship of her looking down on me and being disappointed and upset with me as a person. From the age of six onwards, I can remember feeling a deep sense of shame about myself and felt like I didn’t deserve to exist in life. 

I’ve been in therapy for four years now (I’m 23). My therapists over the years have tried very hard to ingrain in me that I’m not a bad person, but I find it very, very hard to believe. The thing is, I’ve done some messed up things throughout my life as a result of untreated feelings and issues from my childhood. I won’t bore you all with the details, but I’m no saint. For this reason, I can never, ever rid myself of this core childhood pain, this fear, that I’m a bad person. I walk around everyday with this fear that people will find out I’m bad, with this feeling of deep shame that I am even taking up space in the world, overthinking all of my actions and trying so hard everyday to be “perfect” to ensure that I never do anything bad ever again. But it never works, I inevitably end up messing up (and sometimes messing up big time and doing something really bad!). 

I don’t know what to do about all of this. I’ve often told my therapists that I think I would be more accepting of the fact that I am not a bad person, that I would be more compassionate towards myself, if society treated “being a good person” as a skill to be learned akin to learning to ride a bike or learning how to cook. If society didn’t shame people who have done bad things so much and make them feel like shit, I would probably be a lot softer and compassionate towards myself! 

But, the thing is, I am not the world’s best person. I’m no saint. I’m working hard everyday to correct the fucked up behaviors from childhood, but it’s harder for me than other people because I am learning all of this now as an adult. I don’t want to spend every waking moment worrying about whether something I’m doing is bad or fucked up because that sort of perfectionism makes me hate myself more, but I feel like I have to because the world doesn’t treat morality or “being a good person” the same way they treat learning other skills. I often see people online, on Twitter and Reddit (especially places like r/AmITheAsshole), completely shame and crucify those who fuck up in some way, and it makes me eternally afraid of ever doing anything wrong and makes me hate myself for all the bad things I did in my past. 

My question is, how do I rid myself of the shame and fear I have about being a bad person when other people make it seem like I deserve to feel ashamed for those things? Or do I deserve to feel guilty and ashamed for my fuck-ups after all?

Don't steal my story, excuse the formatting, yadda yadda yadda.

I (39f) just got into a ""discussion"" with my nMom. Her sister recently died. I have seen my aunt about 5 times in 20 years, always at a funeral. When mom called to tell me about aunt's death mom spent about a half an hour complaining about aunt. I'm pretty sure mom said at one point ""that's just like her to die without telling me"". The way she talked made it seem like she felt my aunt died just to spite her. I'm not really sure how one does that, but here we are.

My aunt told her husband and kids to not contact her family when she was diagnosed with cancer and was dying. My uncle broke this and told my mom. 

Originally there was not going to be a service because my aunt lived half way across the country. This outraged my mom,  ""how dare they not let us honor my sister"" and so on. Today she called wanting me to help her plan a wake next weekend. I guess she guilted my aunts family into having something. My mom decided it would be best to just have the 25-30 people at her house. I worked into the conversation that my family and I would not be coming. I have 2 kids, 4 M and 6 month f, who are not vaxxed but my husband and I are. If you're not into that, you do you, not looking to debate covid. I'm not real comfortable squeezing my kids into a crowded room of people right now, delta variant and all. My youngest is just getting over RSV and I'm trying to keep our exposure down. Plus, I don't want to go. I didn't really know her or her kids.

My mom flipped when I told her I wouldn't be coming. Told me I was making it all about me and that I was being selfish because I wouldn't find a way to make work Now I just feel bad which I'm sure was her tactic to get me to change my mind.

Recently she's been trying to contact me again about ""rights to the poetry.""

I don’t engage much with the community here on Reddit, but I’m always lurking around. This is the only social media that I really enjoy using.

I need some advice.

I’m writing this because I don’t have many friends that I can share this stuff with and my anxiety has been tearing me apart.

I’m 30 years old and currently going through some really bad stuff in my head that I’m having trouble processing.

I need to take this off my chest and I thought this would be a good place to express myself and maybe someone could help me out. People here are usually quite wholesome, cheerful and wise.

So…

3 months from now I will become a father.

I am really excited about it and I love my fiancée very much. This girl literally changed my life.

I came from a very poor and messed up family. I grew up without a father and had a really resentful mother who was very negative and toxic.

I have so much shit inside me, so much hate and sadness about how my family treated me growing up. I have nightmares about it every other day, it sucks.

I used to cry almost every night about my mother ignoring the fact that a member of her family raped me when I was a child. 

Seriously, this isn’t the kind of thing I can simply ignore, it causes me a lot of daily pain.

As I grew up I turned into a cold, manipulative person. I told horrible lies and used people as it pleased me. I’ve hurted so many people along the years

But then I met Sabrina.

She was this super dorky girl who worked as a teacher and had such a pure heart. She really is the best person I’ve ever met.

We met 4 years ago through an ex-friend and then we started dating immediately. After only a year, we decided to live together.

During this time I cheated on her several times.

I was having affairs at work, seeing hookers frequently and on top of this I was snorting cocaine everyday.

I had this wonderful girl that I was putting through so much horrible stuff. And she loved me so, so, so very much...

In time, I started to feel very guilty.

But soon COVID-19 hitted and things got really bad here in Brazil.

Our money situation got critical and we couldn’t pay rent anymore, so we had to go back and live at my mom’s house.

During these hard times, I was starting to feel something different inside.

Through time, Sabrina was making me feel more open and honest with her and myself.

Her kindness inspired me and the love I felt for her made me want to change because I couldn’t bear feeling that guilt anymore.

I didn’t want to hurt her anymore, she was too good to me…

But I was so scared of her finding out the horrible things I’ve done...

At this point an immense struggle started happening inside of me and I began to reflect upon the concepts of good and evil.

As I started to be honest with myself I realized how much of a shitty person I was… and it was really hard to accept that.

In July 2020 I confessed everything.

I told her everything I’ve done behind her back and who I really was. This was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.

She cried so much, it looked like she was vomiting pain… I felt like a monster.

I was a monter.

She broke up with me and went away to a friend’s house. She lived with her friend for a while.

Sabrina doesn’t have any family. Her parents don’t give a fuck about her existence and they live at the other side of the country.

She was feeling like she never knew me at all and must have felt so alone…

At this point I was really trying to be a better person. I started to study the concept of good and evil which got me into philosophy, buddhism, psychology and mysticism.

I was desperate to cast this monster out and find some good in myself

I tried so hard to change myself and help Sabrina. She was living in really bad conditions over at her friend’s house.

But after some months, her friend kicked her out and she had no choice but to come back to live with me at my mother’s house.

Yeah, I know that sounds like an obvious bad move but I couldn’t leave her homeless. It was the only viable option.

And things between us were bad.

Even though she was trying to make things work between us, it was obvious she resented me a lot.

We talked about this, tried to sort things out. There was a lot of crying and guilt and resentment. It was really ugly.

Situation was really stressful because we had no money and my mother was treating us like shit, like she really hated us for being there.

I was spiraling in depression.

The house was dark, smelled like cigarettes and cheap beer.

Watching how my mother was living and what she has turned into after years of being a sad person was killing me inside.

Some time later, Sabrina got a job as a gym receptionist in a dangerous favela here in Rio.

Things with my mom got worse.

After a big argument over something stupid, my mother tried to hurt Sabrina. That’s when she decided to just leave and sleep on the streets rather than keep living with me like that.

I remember having a complete mental breakdown that day. And in a very dark way, I also remember noticing that my mom looked quite entertained by my own despair.

Luckily, the lady who owned the gym in which Sabrina worked gave her the key so she could sleep on the gym’s floor.

Meanwhile, things here in Brazil were crazy. It was impossible to find a job, no one was hiring, corruption scandals over hospitals, vaccines &amp; shit.

Everything was pretty apocalyptic by that time.

I started doing some graphic designs on Canva and made a bit of money on freelancer.com. Started studying SEO, Copywriting and did some jobs online.

My English was also pretty decent because I spent my entire childhood playing RPG games on my Playstation.

So I started teaching English. I only had one student, but that’s an improvement, right?

Time has passed and Sabrina got back to teaching. Soon enough she was back on her feet and rented an apartment.

This amazing girl is a freaking heroine, I know.

Meanwhile, I was making internal progress, confronting my demons and trying really hard to be a good person while also trying to help my mother.

But living with my mom was putting me in a really dark place…

And that’s when Sabrina got pregnant. We were still seeing each other every other day, so it kinda happened accidentally.

I am really grateful for her forgiveness. I am very grateful for having this second chance...

At first I was really scared, but Sabrina didn’t think twice.

She said that she would be raising our kid whether I was going to be a part of it or not.

Two months ago she invited me to move in together, even though I’m making less than a 100U$D (around 500 Reais in our currency) per month.

I am very happy for finally being forgiven by this women, but now I’m battling against this feeling of being a fucking deadweight on her life.

Our relationship is better than ever and I’ve been taking care of Sabrina with all my heart.

She is a pregnant woman, working her ass off, paying rent, taking care of me and our dog financially.

Sabrina is the strongest and kindest person I know.

As she is juggling a lot of classes to make money, I sit at my computer and try to score any freelancing job I can.

But things are rough right now.

Soon she won’t be able to work anymore (she’s 6 months pregnant) and I’m not providing yet.

I’ve sent out so many resumés, tried out so many ways of making money online…

Even though Sabrina and I have been very happy together, we are starting to get worried about our situation.

I’m trying my hardest. I really am. I try to keep the house spotless clean, I cook for her, take care of our dog.

Everyday I get on the internet and try to score some gig so I can help out, but… fuck. I’m starting to feel like a useless piece of shit…

I feel small, pathetic and powerless. Maybe that’s stupid, but I feel like less of a man…

With all that happening inside me, emotionally, I closed myself off to the world.

I don’t talk to anyone else except Sabrina because I feel so ashamed of myself.

Also I changed so much because of everything that happened that I don’t even know how to introduce my new being to my old friends.

My friends reach out and ask if I’m okay but I always end up ignoring them... and this hurts me so much because I miss affection and validation from friends like everyone else…

I just feel like I don’t want people to see me until I fix my situation...

And this has been going for a while now. I feel so alone and worthless and ashamed to let anyone see me like this.

It got to a point that I decided to live my life to serve my family. Not as a penitence, but because it’s really the only way I can feel good about myself again...

I promised myself I will serve my wife Sabrina, my son Raziel and my dog Coyote.

Today I woke up, made breakfast and cleaned the apartment for my wife.

She left for work and I tried to write some stuff for an idea I had to get some English students.

I’ve always been quite a nerd, so I’m working on this idea of teaching English classes through tabletop RPG games.

As I tried to work on my project today, I felt really sad…

There is a rage of feelings and fear inside of me. I often have nightmares about my family or losing Sabrina.

As the days go by, I feel that my anxiety gets better because Sabrina helped me break free of my mother’s toxicity.

But yet, it feels like I still have a long way to go…

After some time of us not speaking, my mother texted me yesterday and said she missed me. It made my heart ache again, really bad.

Today I kept trying to write stuff for my English teaching project or to just get stuff done around the house but…

Fuck, I feel bad.

But… I have no time to just feel depressed. I need to provide for my family and the clock is ticking!

My son is about to be born and I feel so powerless.

How do I make this feeling go away?  
Tell me, friends from Reddit, how do I stop feeling so overwhelmed by my own sadness?

Now that I am trying to be honest with myself and my own feelings I realize that this is almost impossible.

Facing life with honesty is really hard and I’m trying my best, but…

How do you guys do this? Adult life is kicking my ass and facing it with honest emotions are just making it even harder.

As the days go by, life feels lighter and brighter. It’s been a while since I had nightmares and my mind feels clearer.

But there’s still this fear that I have to conquer inside myself of not being able to provide for my family...

I guess that’s what it means becoming a father, right?

Well, anyway, thanks for reading!

On Monday, one of her friends texted me and said something about my mother texting her saying the landlord wanted to raise the rent and my mother wasnt about it so now she's in a shelter. she said that I should call my mother asap. at first, I was like eh I dont really care but she was so adamant and sounded so concerned so I was like okay. I called her, she didnt answer. I texted my stepdad about it. he called - no answer. I texted my brother - no answer. so now im like what the hell. I texted a friend of mine and asked if she could make sure everything was okay at the house and she told me her brother could. I knew the landlord wouldn't just raise the rent outta nowhere and throw her out, he doesn't operate like that. he has been renting to my family since I was little, he is a very patient and understanding man. so I texted him about it and he was very confused and told me that he never increased the rent and that my mother was in fact still living there. I was LIVID. I told my friend's brother that I didnt need him to check out the house anymore but he was very adamant about going by. so he did. he knocked on the door and apparently had a long ass conversation with my delusional mother. and of course she spat her fire, she told him all the things that my brother and I did - she pretty much made it seem like she did nothing wrong, typical. I explained everything to him whatever. then she called me. I answered to see what she wanted. we got into a full blown argument and she pretty much told me I was jealous and mad and had issues before hanging up. then about 2 hours later, I got a text from my cousin - the only person I talk to in my family - that said my mother called her crying and told her that I told her job to fire her. which isn't true at all. so my mother called the whole family over some mess she started.

I then found out today that she's in the process of pressing charges for harassment against me and my stepdad....when we dont even talk to her. I haven't seen her in literally a year so im confused as to where these harassment charges are coming from. 

I am so frustrated. its so annoying. she just cant fuck off, I hate to use this language. I try so hard to be free of her but she keeps popping up to make everyone's life a living hell. I really hate to say this but I know for a fact I won't be able to live in peace until she is 6 feet under. as long as she is breathing, she will continue to be a thorn in everyone's side.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713489,public,self,NM Strikes Again,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p6yo1k/nm_strikes_again/,some_ads,7,,,[Rant/Vent],,,,,,,,,,

I am too emotionally exhausted to go into the extent of it, but suffice it to say it was significant.  Throughout my adulthood, the abuse ended up being mostly emotional in nature, but still very damaging.  I have gone LC and even NC during my last pregnancy, but talk to her and get together with her more since then.

I am now pregnant with my second child.  It has been rough. To give an idea of the type of dynamic we currently have:  I asked my mother for help with groceries for the first time in nearly 20 years since my paychecks were smaller and behind since I'd gotten behind on my billing (I'm a licensed professional counselor still building a case load).  My mother insisted that I needed to go to her house to work on a budget before she would let me borrow anything since she was afraid that my husband might eat some of the groceries.  Only she wasn't available during anytime that I wasn't working.  This went on for days before my husband's father helped us out and we got back on track.

Fast forward to yesterday.    She  called me sounding intoxicated, so I assumed xanax.  I basically counseled her for nearly 2 hours.  She wants to go on some shamanic journey with ayahuasca, and I was encouraging her to try to get some consistent therapeutic support first.  It sucks because she actually flipped out on me saying I was talking to demons when I told her I was meditating 15 years ago, but whatever.  Anyway, she starts talking about how my younger brother was upset that he isn't executor of her estate instead of my even younger brother (I'm the oldest and actually cared for all of my younger siblings instead of having a childhood while my mother was too messed up to function).  I encouraged her to find a neutral party so there wouldn't be any dissension in the family after she passed away, as I already knew where this was going.  

She is stipulating in her will that my oldest brother will get nothing if he is married to his current wife of 2 years, and neither will I if I stay married to my husband of nearly 10 years.  Instead, the money will be distributed between our 3 youngest siblings and our children. She asked me, ""you're happy with that, right?"". And I replied, ""no, but I respect your decision."". She then proceeded to bait me into an argument about it.  I stayed calm, and told her I found it hurtful, but that it was her money to do as she pleased.  She then talked about killing herself, which I asked her not to do, and when she told me she had to go (I was supposed to keep her on the phone and feel abandoned), I told her I loved her and said goodbye.  I think I handled it well.

Well today, she called me and apologized for screaming at me and threatening to write me out of her will.  Apparently she took mushrooms and had done that after I got off the phone and my younger brother told her about it.  I told her she hadn't done that but had told me about the stipulations she already had written in, and she was relieved, apparently still finding nothing wrong with this.  I found myself apologizing to her for giving her a bad trip.  

After I got off the phone, I felt really screwed up.  I couldn't stop crying.  I mean I don't want her money, but I'm not a drug addict, I have my masters degree, my husband isn't running around gambling and buying drugs, and I am completely dedicated to my children and improving my life.  I am so hurt.  And I get scared when she does things like take my daughter into her room and shuts the door when we visit or tries to imply she is just like her.  It makes me want to keep my daughter far away from her because I know how much she tends to triangulate and tries to divide people. But I also don't want my daughter to be deprived of anything that could make her life easier than mine was.

I just need people to relate to me right now.

I thought others might like a thread where you are free to just share your own experience versus focus on just my own. I'll start the discussion.   


It i related to the topic of medical neglect but is tangential. I just finished a higher degree (post undergrad) and during that time and my early 20s I have pneumonia three times. This is the story about getting it the third time. I had gone home for Christmas with my birth family (Parents in their early 60s, Brother 31, myself 28, sisters 26 and 22). As the oldest daughter and scapegoat I was the primary home maker and child care provider from 13+ until I moved away. Which lead to my Nsister (26) ""lovingly"" referring to me as Cinderella.   


So, on the 25th I was expected to do the majority of the cooking, cleaning, setting the tables and basically running the holiday. I didn't live there, I came as a ""guest"" as did my siblings. But, I started to get the very particular feeling and fatigue that you get right before coming down with pneumonia. It was my third time after all. At one point I told my mom I wasn't feeling well could should ask my siblings to help, which she angrily replied ""Just Let them ENJOY THEIR HOLIDAY.""   


Predictably, the next day I woke up with full blown pneumonia. Was too sick to drive and not a single person offered me any support, checked on me, asked how I was doing. My nsister had randomly caught a mild cold and raged at me for ruining her vacation. Cried in pain. I eventually called a contact and asked them to drive down, pick me up, and bring me back to my house because I couldn't emotionally bare to remain in the place where I had never been shown care or compassion.   


Infected somehow my eyes and spent my the rest of my holiday alone, with double conjunctivitis barely able to see, and pneumonia. (I got help but it was really hard to go through alone).

We will be staying with my bfs family in our own room and I already have a plan to relatively quickly transition us into a stable apartment and give us the best life we can have. I will be doing contracting work and making hundreds per job almost daily, it’s all set in stone. My bfs dad is the kindest person I’ve ever met second only to my bf and is more than happy to let me and my brother stay their spare bedroom as long as we need. I actually will be working with him for the contracting. I also have my own car and although I have a provisional license, I am allowed to drive myself and my little brother to school/work, and in three months I’ll be able to take the drivers test and get my full license. I’ve began collecting what little evidence I do have which is primarily screenshots of searches he has made on his devices to see his step daughter (my older sisters nudes) an email which I have been documenting as much detailed abuse as possible, me and my brothers testimony (I found a local facility that will help with getting my brothers testimony and they do it in a very comforting non pressuring way and they film it so he doesn’t have to repeat it to fifty different people and they can help me get my brother into counseling. So far legally all I understand about guardianship is that to prove I can handle him I need to show I can provide housing, essentials, medical care, and stability. For immediate housing, we have a spare bedroom at my bfs house however I have a clear and detailed plan of the work that I 100% will be doing and a list of apartments that one we will move in to when I have the money. Since I will be working Immediately I will be able to provide clothes, food, doctors visits etc and someone who is willing to support us as back up. Stability wise, again I will be stable working and have options for a second job on top of that. I plan on enrolling my brother immediately in counseling through the facility that will help with the interview. I myself am mentally stable and ever since I was his age I’ve been raising him myself. I changed His diapers fed him bottles and food put him to sleep gave him baths and have always been his emotional support. He would tell anyone if asked that I am here for him and the one he goes to and he has stated in the past without me even prompting the conversation that he wants to live with me. 

I just really need to figure out what the legalities here are and what the process will look like and what steps I need to take for that and how to get a guardianship lawyer if I need one. Additionally I need to decide if we leave this month or if we are willing to wait in this hell hole another two months to see if our mom who has temporarily moved in will be able to get a house (see other post for current situation details) and hopefully not relapse. But again their are a million things that can go wrong with her and I originally planned on after we move in with her taking my brother anyways just it would be easier from her house and I wouldn’t have to burden my bf and his dad.

I obviously refused, saying he was my family, to which my SD replied ""I'M YOUR FAMILY"". several weeks-a month later, he forced me to buy rat poison so he could poison our neighbors dog.

If you can't stand that, please don't read this.)

I just want to see what people think of some of the things my (20f) nMom (57f) has been saying recently. I keep thinking I'm going crazy, the gaslighting is getting to me I'm sure. I'm currently forced to live with her because my only other option is homelessness. I'm trying to get a job but I have severe anxiety and my job coach has been... slow. Applying is terrifying and I'm dissociating most of the day, which makes me feel like I'm not trying. Can't get emergency housing, have no relatives, friends, or anyone I could stay with instead (that aren't also abusive.) 

For context, I have a car, but my nMom has been using it since I was forced to move back in with her. It ran okay before, but it's old, and she's completely destroyed the thing. The car won't even start unless it's jumped, and it has to be driven constantly or else the battery will die. I've asked her repeatedly to please fix it, because I have no money, and she's said 'she has' but obviously if it keeps doing that it isn't fixed?? She says 'it doesn't need to be fixed, it needs to be driven' which is just an excuse to make me feel like I'm not being responsible and for the car to be unavailable when I need it the most. (AKA leaving)

Here's the first message, sent August 11th. Around 7:00am:

&gt;""*Good morning* ***\[My Deadname\]*** *I want to say to you that I have been nice long enough about your car I haven’t yelled I haven’t come on glued yet and I was nice enough to get your car started for you. But today is my breaking point and if your car is not moved out of that man’s parking spot by the time I get home from work I am going to blow a gasket literally your car needs to be started driven and taken care of and I am not gonna be nice anymore I’ve absolutely had it I do love you though*""

For more context; I hadn't driven the car in months, she had been driving it, and she was the one who put it in our neighbor's parking spot. I don't even know where visitor parking is. Notice how she says '*I was nice enough*' as if she actually did something lmao. She jumped my car out of the 'kindness of her heart' yet didn't park it in the right spot?? And blames it on me? How surprising. And for the record, I did go out there and see if the car would start; another surprise, it didn't start. I have ADHD and I forget the car even exists most of the time, which is why I can't 'just drive it every day' either.

She sent this message later in the day when she got home from work.

&gt;""*I’m going out for a beer.  When I get home that car better be moved or the internet is off.  And it will not be turned on again until you can be responsible to take care of your car, clean your bathroom and bedroom, and you are paying rent. Internet is a privilege that you haven’t earned.  I do love you.  But you need to show some responsibility and respect.*""

She's been threatening that I need to pay rent since I moved here three years ago. Yes, I still haven't been able to get a job. I know. Doesn't exactly feel great, I kinda feel worthless actually. But when I first moved in I had been kicked out by my nDad, who had promised me college and that he'd help me get a job, only to kick me out because his eGirlfriend was more important (later eWife.) I moved in depressed, anorexic, and straight-up-not-having-a-good-time. My anxiety is really bad, and my CPTSD from my parents gives me a huge fear of failure, so much so that I worry more about being a burden to my hypothetical employers than I do about still being abused here. Not fun. She's also threatened the internet frequently enough over the time I've been here, which is just her flaunting her control over me, really. Plus, my only chance at a job is online work so of she keeps me from using the internet I literally cannot save up to leave. I'd say she's also threatening my healthy communication with friends but I don't have friends. Whoops. I told her after this that I did go out and try to start the car, but she brushed it off and didn't care. (Almost like she just wanted to complain at me and be the center of attention??? Hmmmmmmm kinda sus buddy)

She sent me this a few hours ago:

&gt;""*How about if you’re not going to talk to me, or help with anything around the house without being paid, you move to your dads house? I deserve more respect, I deserve love.  If you have no respect for me and no love for me, you are free to go to your dads or your own apartment.  I’m giving you and your* ***\[Sibling\]*** *until January 1st to get jobs and pay rent, utilities and groceries, move, or be enrolled in school. The choice is yours. No more free rides. It’s for your own good. Because I love you both.*""

Once again, for context; I've been doing my best to avoid her this past month or... six. I do my best to say in my room, and only come out to eat or shower/etc. I haven't spoken to her face-to-face for a few days, and when that happens she claims that I'm 'ignoring her.' She even perpetuates it by purposefully trying to come home as late as possible, when I've already gone to bed. (But I try to go to bed by the time she gets home so I can eat when she's asleep. Lately I've just been not going downstairs at all when she's home, though.) It's hilarious that she's threatening me with this, because I know what she really wanted to say was '*don't get a job, apply for college instead so you can keep staying with me and being my supply*.' That's what the point of this was, I think. She doesn't actually want me to leave. She's been purposefully keeping me from leaving since I got here, which is part of the reason as to why it's been so hard in the first place.

So what's so bad about moving back in with my nDad, then? His eWife, actually. I hate everything she stands for. She's insanely racist, homophobic, transphobic, the lot. (I mean, my whole family is, but-) The last time I saw my nDad I made the mistake of bringing up how the minimum wage isn't a living wage and things just got worse from there, until I was crying on my way out the door. He sat in front of me while I was having a breakdown and told me I 'wasn't trying' and my generation is lazy, how he's done everything for me and I'm ungrateful and 'attacking him.' I brought up my nMom's abuse, his abuse, and his eWife's abuse, and his reply was 'well at least I didn't hit you.' (He did by the way lmaooo) His eWife is very 'I deserve respect because I exist' and 'anything that isn't exactly what I said is disrespect.' She abused her children, too, who abuse their children as well. How wonderful. 

So yeah, things are shit right now. I just wanted someone to tell me I wasn't going crazy, and that this isn't okay. It's really hard being isolated for so long. I don't have anyone to remind me that I didn't do anything wrong. The global panini didn't change a single thing about my situation besides my nMom inviting c-positive people to live with us, which was fun. (That's sarcasm, I hope to fuck I'm not gonna end up sick in a few days.) Again, all I'm able to do is dissociate most of the day. Applying to jobs is incredibly stressful, and my ADHD paralysis makes it even harder to start. I don't have any work experience, and I'm even terrified to work because I worry I'll screw something up. I have a job coach, but she's got cancer and is struggling herself, so I don't even have her working full-time to help me (plus she has other clients.) I haven't been taught anything about anything, including taxes, paychecks, literally any adult shit. So going in blind makes it even worse, which makes it hard to even start. Looking at job listings actually makes me cry because I get so overwhelmed. Every time.

I just get lost in it sometimes. Lost in the story my nParents write. It's insane how they completely insert their own self-obsessed bullshit into the core beliefs of fucking children. How they convince us that we're worthless and have no worth outside of praising them. I'm so deprived that phone calls with doctors and my job coach are just a few words away from becoming a therapy session. And I get stuck between forcing my FAWN response on random people (because my trauma makes me expect them to be upset for literally nothing) and desperately begging for help for myself. It's mental.

I just had a flashback to my school uniform jumper that was signed by all my friends and classmates at the end of the the whole secondary school stint. I remember coming home one day, maybe a year after I finished school and saw my Nmum wearing my school jumper around the house and she had washed it so that none of the messages were on it anymore. When I asked if she washed it and she said yes, I was upset and told her it was never meant to be washed and why was she wearing it anyway. I don't remember if I got an answer to the last question. 

Then in my early 20s she asked me to help her take some old clothes to the charity bin (they were all stuffed into black bin bags) and when we threw it all in, she just started laughing really hard and when i asked what was so funny, she told me that I had just thrown my favourite fleece jumper.

On innumerable occasions she has borrowed jewellery from me and either tried not to return it and when I did get them back they were missing a stone, the ring was warped out of shape or she plain lost them.

She would always wear my clothes without asking and worst was when she actually let the neighbour go into my wardrobe and borrow an item of clothing of mine and never told me. I saw the neighbour in my stuff and asked he if it was mine and she lied and then when I asked my mum she said that it was indeed my stuff.

Gosh so many other things. In all of these scenarios I was rude person because I was upset with her for doing those things.

I need an anonymous place to rant so here it is: 

I'm immensely dumfounded by my mother's approach to parenting. When I was 15 it came to my school's attention that I had been self harming, they informed her of course and she had one short conversation with me about it and it was never brought up again. The school wanted to organise an appointment with the nurse to discuss this and when I attended she had called my mum beforehand and the two of them decided I was just ""trying it out"" because I had friends that did it. Everything I told the nurse after that was pointless because she'd made up her mind. Honestly this absolutely enrages me because I was actually trying to get help at the time and if I had gotten it I wouldn't be covered in scars like I am now. 

More recently my depression hit the lowest it's ever been and I finally sought help. I told my parents about it, more because my sister was worried about me than because I wanted to. Again she barely mentioned it except to ask me ""why are you actually depressed? Like what reason?"". Due my depression I've been signed off of work multiple times during different break downs and all she's done is tell me I'm going to lose my job and I can't quit because no one will ever hire me again if I do. I told her my job genuinely makes me want to kill myself and she just said ""oh come on that's a bit much"" I responded ""well no I'm literally depressed"" but she just shrugged that off. She's genuinely the kind of person that'll treat me like that but if I ever did commit suicide she'd be announcing to everyone how hard she tried to help me etc.  

I've been exploring online at the possibility of me having ADHD as it's been a running joke in my family that I have it and I think it'd really put everything into perspective for me. She doesn't even want to entertain this and clearly thinks it's ridiculous despite my therapist urging me to speak to a doctor about it because she thinks it's likely. I mentioned to her that I've seen a lot of people get questionnaires for their family to fill out about any behaviour they may have noticed and all she said  very bluntly was ""hm we'll see"". 

She also started informing me of all her marital issues and just bad-mouthing my dad whenever he isn't around. My dad isn't a perfect man but these grievances she has are honestly ridiculous and most of the time I can see where he's coming from. For example, she wanted to take a large amount of money from HIS pension to redo the house and he said no, he gave no reason but it's no secret that she's terrible with money to the point where I've had to pay her mortgage and loan her money frequently. She's also particularly annoyed when my dad is unwell (he has lung disease and often gets infections that are quite serious) she says she has no sympathy for the ""dying duck"" act and gets angry when he's clearly struggling but if she were ill it would be a completely different story.  

I can't even talk about any of this with her because if I even imply she's a bad parent all hell would break loose. It would all be flipped onto me and she'd stop talking to me all together which isn't ideal as I've recently had to move back home. Something in me today snapped during dinner, i was talking to my dad and she just loudly cut me off to inform him of some stupid post she'd seen on Facebook. I just felt defeated and stayed silent for the rest of my meal. It's becoming more and more clear that she doesn't care about anything that isn't to do with her and I just don't know how to cope anymore.

My NF has always believed the virus is a hoax (conspiracy cooked up by the evil government) and he keeps saying this to absolutely anyone willing to listen. 

My NM thinks Covid is JUST a flu in spite of the examples I gave her of my friends with sick parents in the hospital. 

My mother even has friends/acquaintances who were in the hospital from Covid and she talked to them after recovery. YET she's still in complete denial of how severe this virus is. 

As you imagine they're both unvaxxed and they'll never touch the vaccine. 

Unfortunately, they're in the vulnerable category-high blood pressure, obesity etc. So my fear is that, when I'll call them later on in a couple of months, they'll both be fighting the virus AND, they'll continue to deny the virus affected them in any way. 

Of course I am worried for them because they barely practice social distancing but I can't do anything about it. No one is able to convince these people that we're currently dealing with the most dangerous flu virus that had ever been around and I'm weary they'll suffer the consequences of that. 

It's so sad and ridiculous if you ask me.

Hi everyone, I’ve never actually spoken to anyone about my parents before, so this is a bit scary, but I’m having a really tough time right now and just need a safe place to rant and get advice.

Here’s some context, sorry but this is gonna be a long one…

When I was 17 my parents forced me to move 10 hours from my hometown even though I had taken a very long time to find a stable friend group, and was finally happy. 

I had a really hard time with bullying and getting used to the new requirements/standards at my new school, so eventually I decided to move to an online school. This was a hard time in my life but on the bright side I ended up graduating like 7 months early, while I was still 17.

Since I was still considered out of state I told my parents that my plan was to work for the rest of the year and then to start college when I was 18 like I would have if I had graduated at my normal time. I didn’t want to pay 2x as much to start school early, and I was only making $8 an hour at the time, so I figured saving up and starting normally was the smartest thing to do. 

My parents were furious over this and forced me to start college at 17 because “they weren’t going to foot my bills for any longer than they had to” and because “I wasn’t owed anything just for being alive.”

I ended up only taking 2 classes that first semester because it was all I could afford, and 3 classes the following one. This is what most people take in a single semester, but my parents refer to this as “my first year” and have told me that I need to finish up my entire degree in 3 more years or I’m going to be kicked out.

This has put huge strain on me both emotionally and financially by forcing me to take 6 classes some semesters, and by forcing me to pay for summer classes out of pocket to get caught up. My parents are very well off financially, and told me my whole life they would “help” pay for my school, but they have paid barely any at this point, and won’t even allow me to go to the doctor unless I pay for it. 

Currently I’m in the midst of my junior year, but because of some messed up shenanigans and the pandemic, I am only given the $6500 sophomores get in Federal loans. Because of this I still have a few grand each semester I have to pay out of pocket, not counting books, parking passes, etc. I’m trying very hard to avoid private loans because starting pay for my future career is only 46k, so I need to be very careful with how much debt I incur, as well as with interest rates. 

Before I could just work I order to pay this, but as I get farther into my degree (I’m an education major) I’m starting to have field placements and much harder classes that are making it difficult for me to reasonably work more than 20 hours a week. I am on campus from 8am to 8pm 4 days a week and I work 16 hours every weekend, but it’s not enough. I also have $1400 I need to come up with for summer classes again this summer, but I don’t know how I’m going to make it. My school just keeps hitting me with more and more fees, and my parents blame it all on my “laziness.”

All of this is starting to take a tole on me. I’m exhausted all the time, I’ve noticed my driving is getting bad, I’m having awful nightmares, I don’t eat well, my grades are slipping, and even my coworkers have noticed that “I always seem sad.” I feel like I’m not strong enough to do what I need to on my own, and I’m scared. 

Now onto my parents… 

My parents are the kinds of parents who like to pass of neglect as a life lesson. Despite being very well off financially they would very often refuse to buy me clothes that fit as a kid, take me to the doctor/dentist regularly, or even to cook meals regularly. They always justified this by telling me that “that’s life” or by repeating their mantra… “you aren’t owned anything just for being alive.” 

They also had issues with alcohol when I was younger as well as with allowing my 14-16 year old family members to drink and behave badly in front of me, but this grew better over time.

They constantly threaten me financially, and will threaten to kick me out over small things like leaving a cup on the counter, or forgetting to turn off a lamp. And as I mentioned before, they refuse to pay for any of my college, and I’m struggling with that as well. 

I have a very difficult time accepting help from anyone because growing up “help” was always something that would get held over my head later on. My parents would rarely do nice things for me, but when they did, there was always a price. My mother would often tell me she was going to buy me things only to make me put them back at the checkout counter stating that “daddy will scream at me if I spend too much.” This was often done with clothing, school supplies, etc. 

They also very much like to “embellish” their past accomplishments and then use them as an excuse to call me lazy. The current lie they like to manipulate me with is…

“Your mother paid for her $20,000 a year degree when she was making $3 an hour. She didn’t have any loans, so you don’t have any right to complain.”

This is blatantly false and would mean that my mother would have somehow managed to work 128 hours a week, 52 weeks out of the year, all while being a full time student. A quick google search also shows that tuition to her college was $6,000 a year when she went, not $20,000. 

Anyways, I feel like over getting a bit sidetracked, and this is way too long, so let me put it simply…

- My parents don’t give off the vibe that they like me, let alone love me. 
- They treat me like a huge burden, and for years have made me feel guilty for being alive.
- I have a hard time taking about this with anyone because they don’t physically abuse me, and because we are well off financially. I feel like an ungrateful crybaby a lot of the time.
- They make me feel like everything wrong with the world is my fault, and lie to me in order to make me feel inadequate.
- I am scared for the future of my finances as well as for my schooling

I’m sorry this was so long, but I really just needed to rant, and writing this felt good. Does anyone else here have similar circumstances, and if so, how are you managing/ how did you manage?

According to me he has always been financially abusive. He makes me feel guilty for every penny he spends on me to the point that I think about whatever I need a thousand times before I go ask him for it and even then I'm scared shitless that he will not allow me to have it.

On top of that he holds everything he spends on me over my head... but indirectly. So to me he will say nothing, but he will go to my mom and say oh look I spend 300 on getting her a root canal for example. And when I say I'm his responsibility and he has no right to guilt trip me about it. If he didn't want to spend money on his kids why have them in the first place?.. he gets all butt hurt saying he is doing the best he can.

Keep in mind he gets a good salary and is very well off. But he hates spending any of this money on us. 90-95% of his salary goes into a bank account that only he has access to and this has been the way for as long as I know. And no it not being invested, it's just sitting in the bank losing value every single day. I understand and believe in the concept of savings but what he does is, in my opinion, overboard.

And me calling him out puts me in a bad position with my family because according to them he does so much for us and I'm still an ungrateful little b**ch towards him and I should be more grateful for all that he has done for us.

Umm... isn't that his responsibility? He made the choice of getting married and having kids. If he was not willing to spend any of his money on his family why bother having a family in the first place? It's not a necessity to have a family even if you don't want to.

But I came across the idea of narcissistic parents recently and am wondering if mine fit the bill.  

Some examples: When I was applying to college and considered going away to school, my mother's response was, ""Why do you need to go away to school anyway? You could just go to the community college and become a secretary. That's good enough."" I went back to school for two Master's degrees, and my mother's response during the second one was, ""Aren't you tired of studying already?"" During my teen years, my dad reprimanded me for putting menstrual pads in the garbage where he could see them. He said, ""I knew about that well before you were even born. I don't need to see it in the garbage."" He was an hour late to my high school graduation because ""my mother didn't remind him"". When I was dating in college, he gave me the white wedding dress speech: ""When you were born, all I ever wanted was to one day walk you down the aisle in a white wedding dress and know that you deserved to be in it.""

However, now as an adult, I feel they continue to cross boundaries that my husband and I agree are inappropriate for grown adults with their own home. They knew the code to our garage door, so they'd come in with no warning or advance notice. Sometimes, they'd go into the backyard and look in the back patio door because we have no curtain or blinds on it. It would annoy my husband, but he was too respectful of them to say anything, and I always had the feeling that these are my parents and I should allow it. 

Now that I have my daughters, my mother continues to do and say things that clearly indicate she doesn't know her place. When I went over to my parents' house one time for a family get-together, my mother got mad that I went into another room to pump. She said, ""Why do you have to do that now? We have guests!"" Due to past history, I also have little reason to trust her.  At six months old, she dropped my daughter on her head on a tile floor after she dismissed my concerns that she was not secure enough.  For a while, she was adamant about wanting my daughter to sleep over. When my mother saw that I wasn’t comfortable with it, she'd turn to my daughter and say, ""You want to sleep over grandma's, don't you?"" 

In the past year and a half, I feel like it's gotten worse.  In the fall, my father showed up outside my work and sat in his car, waiting to see if I showed up. I am a teacher. Do I need to mention the inappropriateness of a strange man sitting outside an elementary school without reason to be there? A month later, both he and my mother were sick. When I tried to get them both appointments to be vaccinated, my father got belligerent with me on the phone because ""I didn't care about my family, and I didn't want to see them"". By late spring, they were sick again, although we don’t know with what but they were laid out for 3 weeks. When they got better, it was almost Father's Day and my mother tried to take over the day with no consideration for my husband. 

The last straw came a few weeks ago when she showed up at our door, again unannounced, no phone call, no advance notice. We were in the middle of eating breakfast, and we pretended we weren’t home.  The following week, she brought it up on a video call in order to lay on the guilt trip. My husband and I both lost it. My mother's response was that she didn't feel like she should have to stand on ceremony. My father didn't even want to talk to us. She kept looking to the side, and I knew he was there but pretended like he wasn't. So now, my husband and I are fed up and wonder if it's worth maintaining the relationship.  Do they sound like narcissists?  They've never been physically abusive, but the examples I've cited make me wonder about where our relationship falls.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713466,public,self,Are my parents narcissistic?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p6vuox/are_my_parents_narcissistic/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm very happy that I found this sub.
It feels good to know, that I'm not alone with my experiences.

I want to tell you my story. I have to, because I'm falling apart at the moment. 

I was raised by narcissists. Not the kind of them, that beats their kids. My parents are manipulative geniuses. 
My father is the type of narcissist that only does things for himself. He is neither empathic nor understanding. 
He blamed me for everything since I am able to think. He was never there for me. Always promising stuff to me and when I was so happy to finally do stuff with my dad, he just shit on me and did other stuff that was more important for him than his only child.
The worst thing about it is, that he always made me believe, that he's the greatest and that I am the lazy, aggressive kid who never does what his father tells it to do.
He sucked out my self-esteem, my confidence, everything. 
He insulted me. I never knew, when he would freak out next.
He punished me by taking the only thing, that really took me away from that horrible reality. My PC.
After an argument he stopped talking to me, he completely ignored me. And suddenly, after a few days, everything was like it was before.
I never understood, why he acted like that.

My Mom was the exact opposite, but also with extremely narcissistics traits. She loved blaming me when I did stupid shit, she was shittalking about me with her friends, she was always so shocked, when I did something, that didn't fit her imagination of the perfect child.
On the other hand, she still gave me a lot of love. That's the only reason, I am still alive today.
My mom was traumatized by the death of her sister, who died from heroin abuse.
Her worst fear was that I get addicted to something. She always told me, that I already was addicted and how bad gaming is for me. She was so toxic when she had the feeling to be a bad mother.

They did blame me for almost everything, my dad bullied me, my mum overcared and put me under massive pressure. My IQ is 125 and she always expected that I will do all the stuff that she wants. She thought, she could improve my ""genius"".
I hated it. I had to do so much stuff that I didn't want to do. I was forced to do it anyway. I was blamed when I didn't want to. They didn't care about my feelings, blamed me EXTREMELY for my anger. Laughed about me when I was scared about something. 

And the worst thing about it is here to come.
They are manipulative as fuck. They always showed themself as the good parents and gave me the feeling, I was a bad kid and a failure. 
They brainwashed me. And it worked.

Now, I'm taking medication against my depression and anxiety daily, I developed a pot addiction and it feels like my parents are now in my head, constantly telling me that I'm doing everything wrong and that I'm not worth shit.
I was able to move out and since december '20 I'm living alone. I'm broken inside. My heart feels like it has shattered.

I'm in therapy for 6 years now and I did a lot of progress. But there's still this incredible emptiness inside of me. I'm so done of it.

I will move on, because I promised it to my grandma. But it's so hard. Every day is so incredibly hard. I'm struggling with eating and sleeping. My body feels horrible. My stomach hurts all the time. It's just to much too carry.


Maybe you guys can show me, how you are healing your inner wounds. I would appreciate so much.

All those danger or overstimulated feelings I got in my body when they were being violent and fighting each other I learned to associate with safety becuse they made no effort to actually make me feel safe. So I had to look for some version  of good feelings  in the bad/painful feelings. Since hearing people screaming and knowing I'm not abandoned is alittle better than being neglected and thinking I've been abandoned....that was my postive feelings my only version of safety.

My “mother” has been in assisted living since the end of June. My husband and I moved her to our state 5 years ago because she was declining and had discarded my siblings one too many times- she’s burned bridges and never had to pay the price for it. There was always someone there to clean up her debris. We thought she would be here, at most, a year. We found an apartment for her one mile from our home. Five years later, she’s finally off of my back and someone else responsibility. In the five years that she’s been here, I’ve had countless panic attacks and one mental breakdown. I’m currently in therapy. My husband had no idea what my childhood was like. I kept that hidden (I’m realizing that the shame I felt  that kept me silent all those years was theirs and never mine) until one day 3 years ago, she had a toxic meltdown on him (I was not there), and when he told me about it, something snapped in me, and I told him (over a period of months) what my childhood was like. He was horrified. He believed me from the start. Since that day, he has been my shield and a fantastic buffer from her. He took most of the responsibility for her care and helped me shoulder the rest. He is the reason that I am functional. Since she’s been in the facility, I feel like I can finally breathe. No more taking her to countless doctor appointment, no more cleaning her apartment, no more picking up her meds, no more keeping track of her meds, no more getting her groceries, no more calling her every night, no more listening to her complain, no more being told what I have to do for her, and most importantly- NO MORE HER. The only thing I will do is visit her once per week for an hour and only with my husband present. I’ve wanted my life back for the past five years. I’ve been in stasis for each of those years. I have not been free to live my own life. I have resented each moment that she’s been here. I have had to do things for her that were never done for me. I did not get taken to the doctor, yet I had to take her on a whim. She did laundry once a month (ask me if I had 30 pairs of underwear- I did not.), yet she would make sure that I had her laundry done and done to her specifications. I had to take her to get her hair done.  When I needed a haircut, I was told, “No, nobody’s looking you anyway.“  I had to help her figure out her insurance. When I needed help with picking classes in high school, she told me not to bother her with that shit. I could list countless examples, but I know that you know- why else would you be here? For the first time in five years, my husband, son, and I were able to take a family vacation together. Since she’s been here, someone would always have to stay behind to look after her. Not any more. She is miserable in the facility- she makes sure to tell me as soon as I arrive. I have encouraged her to join in the MULTIPLE activities the facility provides, but she refuses. She would rather guilt me for her loneliness than take part in any social program to lighten her mood. She will choose misery until the day she dies. She must love it. She’s welcome to it. She can sit in her room and be miserable. That was acceptable to her for me while I lived in that house- at least I’ll check in on her once a week. I’m almost at the finish line- she will never leave the facility, I am no longer obligated to care for her in any way, my husband knows my past, and I’m in therapy. I’m not sure why I decided to post- maybe I’m feeling safer now that there is no way that she can reach me. When the phone rings, I don’t get a spike in my anxiety anymore- it will never be her on the other end tasking me with the latest Labor of Hercules. She is contained in the facility, and I am so relieved. She could have been a queen- she has 3 children, 3 in-laws, 5 grandchildren, and 7 great grandchildren. If she had been any kind of a mother, we would all have been vying to see who could take her in.  We are all good, kind people. She should be so proud of us all. Instead, she has discarded my siblings numerous times over the most petty garbage.

I have been lurking on Reddit for awhile. I had a massive clash with my mother recently that has alot of fallout. I was explaining to a friend how my childhood was with my mother and he told me to come here and just read some of the posts and it's been...rough. I feel like maybe my mother is a narcissist but I also feel like my childhood wasn't bad.

I have a very vivid memory of when I was 12 (I'm 26F now) and her screaming at me saying if I don't like how she does things to leave. Well I did. And she was pissed when I finally got back home. Other things were her waking me up at insane hours because I didn't do something her way, screaming at me for defending myself and saying I am just being combative, forcing me into confrontations that made me panic, on one occasion she told a person I had a crush on them while I was there and then getting upset when I didn't like that. There is just alot from my childhood that I thought was normal that wasn't apparently.

The most recent thing actually cost me a job. She and my dad are talking about splitting up. My dad thought he could fix things and my mom (without talking to him) has already been looking for new places and was talking to another guy. The guy ended up being one of those Nigeria catfishing scams. Since then, she has pulled out of allowing my husband to borrow a car since I needed my car for work and just dropped watching my kids. I ended up having to quit my job so my husband can get to work (his job pays better). We relied and trusted her and she just dumped us while we are trying to get back on our feet. 

I would go on about how she has treated my sister but that's a whole different rant. Long story short, my mom is homophobic towards my very gay sister. I hate it.

I'm just struggling to understand what I did wrong for my mom to treat me like this. Even now as an adult I feel like I just disappoint her. I'm hoping that posting this out here I can get some answers or maybe others who understand. I'm not sure if my mom is a narcissist.

This subreddit really helped me recognize my moms actions for what they were even though I did second guess and doubt what I was feeling. It feels amazing to have something that has been a weight on me for years at this point lifted, even if it's just a little bit and I'm still working through this.

As background:

I joined this subreddit on a different account about 2 years ago and eventually convinced myself that my mom's behavior wasn't that bad despite the fact that a lot of it still affects how I feel about myself *6 years* after moving out her house and going pretty low-contact with her (I still feel comfortable with the boundary of talking to her occasionally. I have nephew that lives in her house that I still want to support.)

She has a history of commenting negatively on my appearance unprovoked, a lack of boundaries, outright screaming, parentification, treating us as adults rather than children, and prioritizing herself over the needs of me and my sister (i.e. Needing a computer for school and buying herself a new TV instead, redecorating the house instead of paying my tuition in high school and college.)

She's recently gained the habit of calling me pretty consistently. When I don't answer for a couple of her calls, she'll start with ""*I've been calling you. Why don't you answer me. You need to tell me things.""* before even saying 'hello' and it's been putting me in a bad place. I'm a person in my mid twenties with a full-time job, a new house, and friendships that I'm trying to maintain. I'm just busy and don't have the time to pretend that I like my mom.

Needless to say, we've never had an amazing relationship so, it was weird to me that she wanted to be my friend all of sudden despite the fact that she's used the line 'I'm not your friend' multiple times with me. I decided to bring it up with a therapist I've been seeing recently. After talking through it with she said, ""Have you ever looked up narcissim in mothers?"" *Holy shit.* I had never mentioned me being in this subreddit before and after talking about my mom for a single session she came up with this.

At this point, I had everything validated and gathered the courage to tell my mom that I was officially putting up a low-contact boundary the next time she called.

While I understand trauma bonding and why with parents, you cling to one if the other is abusive, but I really don't think people, in general, are holding Enablers accountable for their part is narcissistic abuse.

Once I was well into mental health treatment and had actually confronted the abuse I received from my NMom, that's when my therapist started talking about my Dad more and more. Where was he when these things happened? How did he react when I went to him about what my mom was doing? Did he ever challenge my mom whenever she was hurling emotional abuse at her children? How did he handle the situation when my mother was still active in her alcoholism?

In the beginning of when we were examining my father's role in all of this, I defended him a lot. Saying I was a Daddy's girl and that he kept her behavior in check. But as I really began to look at the whole picture, it really clicked with me with what the word ""enabler"" really means. That my NMom was empowered in her abuse of her children and her alcoholism because she had a partner that enabled her behavior. A partner who picked up her slack where she failed as a parent, but never helped his children cope with her behavior and left those kids in that situation. How my EDad spent all of his energy ""taking care"" of my mother in a way that allowed her alcoholism to thrive and prevented her from having to deal with the consequences of her actions. He infantilized her, helped keep her sick in her alcoholism, and he failed us when it came to her behavior.

We are as a culture becoming more and more aware of narcissism and narcissistic abuse; we are seeing terms like gaslighting, grey rocking and setting boundaries more and more all over the place. But I don't see anyone (other than our patron saint, Dr. Ramani) really talking about enabling and it's role in emotional abuse. And working through that dynamic, especially when it involves trauma bonding, is painful, but I believe crucial part of healing the damage caused by narc abuse.

Oof this got a lot longer than I anticipated. TL;DR at the bottom.

I don't even know where to start this post; I'm so hilariously upset.

(Background: My father is very much a ""Trump is the best"" kind of Republican.)

Throughout the whole pandemic so far, my father has been staunchly in the ""Covid is just the flu, The democrats are making it up, The CDC is a sham"" Camp. He refuses to get vaccinated. 

Early on, I tried my best to get him to understand the ramifications of those views, but was met with anger, defensiveness, and dismissiveness. What's worse is that he works in a Customer-Facing field (remaining vague for privacy reasons), so even if he's actually wearing his mask and using sanitizer, there's still a significant risk he could be infected. And then bring that infection home to my mother.

So I gave up. I stopped talking to him about it, and I tried very hard to set down the emotional burden of caring about him making stupid, selfish choices about himself and everyone around him. 

Four days ago, my sister tells me that my parents both have COVID, and my father had COVID when he visited my apartment the prior week (while symptomatic; also I know this is my fault for not just refusing to see him without him being vax'd, but I'm so beat down at this point.) Note: they never contacted me, and still haven't. I had to hear about all of this through my sister.

Naturally, I freak out and immediately rush out to try to get a rapid test to make sure I don't have it and to make sure that I haven't accidently spread it to other people. (Thankfully, I'm negative.) 

This whole time, I'm just so incredibly angry; this could have been prevented (mostly, probably) if he had been vaccinated. He endangered himself, my mother (who is vaccinated, thankfully), my sister, and I (also all vax'd). So I didn't call, because at this point, I don't care. Like sure, I hope he survives because deep down I do care about him, and I hope he doesn't have to go to the hospital, but I literally can't have any sympathy for him at this point. He made his bed and now he's lying in it; in my head, he almost deserves this. 

My mother is fine. She had symptoms for like 3 days and its basically back to normal now (WOW Vaccines work!! Who would have thought?!? /s) But my father is still doing poorly. Not hospital worthy, but definitely isn't having a good time and has been consistently bad for 3-4 days now.

Cut to yesterday where my mother calls me and spends an hour berating me on the phone because ""I'm selfish and self-centered for rushing out to get tested and not calling to see how my father is doing."" Apparently my father ""feels so disrespected that I haven't called."" She even tried to start off the conversation with ""I want to hear your side of things"" but she definitely did not care because it went in one ear and out the other, because my father's feelings about the situation are the only valid ones. 

She even had the gall to say (essentially; I can't really remember exactly what she said, at this point in the call I was on the edge of a breakdown) ""I don't know why you're acting like this; its not like we abused you!"" Because apparently what she's doing isn't abuse and I should be just happy that she doesn't and hadn't hit me.

Apparently I have to call today and apologize to him for not calling and checking on him. Otherwise *I'm* the one creating the rift in our relationship that will never be fixed. Because I'm so self-centered.

I feel like this is just so incredibly entitled?? But I also can't really tell because I feel almost gaslit into this being my fault. 

Sorry for the incredibly long post. Ultimately I'm going to ""apologize"" to keep the peace for another year until I can move and put 2,000 miles between them and me. But its just so frustrating.

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read it.

Sometimes I feel like I don’t belong in groups or I suddenly start feeling things like “I shouldn’t be here, I don’t fit with these people”, when I actually do?

It’s difficult to explain, but it’s like an imposter syndrome caused by a lack of confidence, an “expectation” of rejection by others linked to a social anxiety because of an avoidant attachment style, and also probably internalising narc criticism which has made me feel like I don’t deserve my achievements and that any time something has gone well in my life it has been a “fluke” (and not a result of genuine hard work or something I deserve).

I suppose it can be traced back to a poor and inaccurate self-image, but I am worried it’s really impacting my ability to make genuine connections with other people.

My nmom was both sides of the same coin. By all accounts, she was a great mom (and she really was; she paid for after school activities for years, most of the presents I wanted, nice clothes and shoes), but it was all for show. She made sure that I looked like my mom treated me well, but the emotional abuse was *chefs kiss* abundant. The insults, the gaslighting, the manipulation, the guilt trips, all of it. But out of her four kids and my stepdad, I was the oldest and her main focus. The cycle was so bad that when I got a detention and my principal asked her if everything was going well at home, that my mom took my phone for 11 months. THEN I had after school practice (from 4pm-5pm), obviously couldn't call her to pick me up, and a teacher saw me and waited with me until 8pm, until she decided to come get me. Then I got in more trouble because I made her look like a bad mom, yet again. (I couldn't use the teachers phone because I didn't remember my mom's phone number at the time.)

Anyway, that's just an example of her specific cycle. She controlled who i talked to, what I did, where I went, all of my money, when she let me have a job, and even what car I got. When I made a mistake, she drilled into me that my physical appearance was subpar, I'm a failure, I'll never succeed, etc, then there's a huge overexaggerated punishment. Rinse, repeat. The last time came when I got a C in a college course while still living at home (age 20). She told me I'm a failure, I would never be successful blah blah blah, and manipulated me into joining the military. But that's where I found therapy (for my nmom and other issues). I got out and have been LC with her since.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? A lot of the stories I read on here seem much more extreme, like abuse and control to the point where NC is the only option. Lately, with the pandemic I haven't been going to therapy, and I'm starting to question things. For example, ""my mom was great, and went out of her way to get me things that I wanted, why am I feeling all this resentment?"". Maybe I'm only remembering the good times? Maybe it wasn't that bad? But then I turn around and immediately compare her to Rapunzel's ""mother"", who sheltered her physically, who controlled what she did, who manipulated and gaslighted her, and made her feel guilty for things that weren't her fault. 

I know this is really long, but over explaining is something that I'm unfortunately very good at.

Im sorry for my English. So I needed advice on something. My dad acts weird with me from when I was a kid. He kept touching me weirdly and slapping on my butt from my childhood. But the things are too much for a couple years now. I think my dad is and was molesting me. He hugs me too tightly from behind, too often and his hands goes to places where it shouldn't go. He sits just beside me on the couch,even if the whole couch is empty and keeps staring at my thighs or touches them. He slaps my butt and slaps on other places he absolutely shouldn't. Sometimes he treats me like his gf.He keeps touching me everywhere,in my private places. He walks in intentionally when I shower. He showered with me upto when I was 9, just under the excuse that it would take less time. He once tried to kiss me on my lips but I kicked him away. But when I lay on my bed he comes in and kisses me on my cheeks,forehead,shoulders and necks all forcefully. 

When we were on vacation 2 weeks ago,he kept touching my thighs and all over me while driving along all the way. He kissed me on beach and when I tried to get away he slapped me on my private places. He kept taking photos of me in bikini on the beach.

It all affects me mentally and im so scared of my own biological dad. I can't feel safe anywhere. I talked to him about it so many times but all he keeps saying is that,"" I can do this,you're my girl "". I can't stop him physically he's a lot taller and stronger. When I yell at him or force him to stop he gets mad at me. But after all this he keeps doing it again and again. I didn't knew about all this until recently. He is molesting me. It only stopped for a week when I told about this to my mom,few months ago. But she laughed and wasn't serious and then it started again. I tried to bring it up to my school counselor about a year ago but she refused to believe anything before I could even tell everything.

I also think my parents are narcissists, a term I came to know about recently. Its because they always blame me for everything and always tell me im not worth to be alive.They don't care about me and always tell me that im a mistake and I should get lost.They beat me and abuse me physically. When I told about what my dad does to me recently to her, she told “if it’s a problem to you then don’t be here. He’s your dad. He doesn’t mean it like that. You’re so ungrateful”. I don't want to live here even for a moment but im 12 and I have nowhere else to go. One week ago,my dad even told that I will not get married and I will stay with him,at dinner when my parents were talking about me. But my mom didn't protest or say anything back.

I can't take it anymore. I need help. Im suffering from depression,trauma,self harm,panic attacks and sometimes I pass out.My mental health is dead. Im suicidal too.

Okay, so this may be a bit long, but I’m going to try summing or up as much as possible. The folks at r/legaladvice were very disrespectful and don’t quite understand narcissistic abuse, so I had to go elsewhere for any type of constructive help.

**Backstory:**

**TW: Abuse**

As the title states, my friends abusive parents have been trying to track them down and make them return home ever since they ran away a few months (maybe even a year or two) ago. Mind you, this is a grown person we’re talking about, they’re 19 going on 20. The parents have been using the excuse that the child is sick and needs to be at home so they can take care of them. The child is fine, only suffering from mental trauma from all of the emotional abuse. The police in the state that the parents reside have stopped helping them, as they say the parents have been wasting their time filing reports on a child who clearly isn’t missing, just done with their BS, so they came to the state in which my friend ran to, and have gotten the police involved here.

We live in a safe house for runaway youth, and the parents found out their kid was living here. By rule were not allowed to tell parents that their kid is here, but they brought the police with them so we had to comply with a “wellness check.” The parents then proceeded to go around to some of the stores my friend and I frequent giving out their card and telling them to contact their number the next time the kid comes in the store. My friend is currently in the hospital due to ptsd, and because the police were involved, the parents were able to find out they were there and showed up at the hospital. Now my friend is terrified of being discharged out of fear that they’re waiting outside for them.

**What we’re doing:**

We’re currently looking for legal action to be taken against the parents, but a Civil Protective Order and Anti-Stalking Order both require my friend to show up in court, which they say will be too traumatic for them and they’re not sure if they want to go through with.

They are, however, planning to go in person to the police department and asking them to stop helping the parents because they are indeed not missing, and they are just running away from their abuse.

We’ve been looking for ways to possibly get the parents arrested/make them lose their jobs, but the only thing we found is that the parents can get jail time for making false reports and wasting the police’s time. We don’t know the specifics, but this seems like our only solid option right about now. 

My friend does have some evidence of the abuse, but not the most extreme of it, and the legal system kinda sucks when it comes to emotional abuse anyways, so we’re not sure if that would be enough. 

I guess what I’m here to ask is, what can we do other than a protective order to make sure some legal repercussions are taken against the parents? Have any of you taken legal action against your n’parents? What did you do, and what was the outcome? How can we permanently stop the parents from being able to harass my friend like this, constantly tracking them down, lying about them being mentally unable to take care of themself, etc.?

Also, my friend wants to know if there’s a way they can get their missing persons report removed from the internet. I haven’t found a way to do that, but they’re very unsettled by the fact that it’s there, and they want it gone.

I just want to write out what happened again.

I woke up in the morning to glass shattering against the wall and screaming. 

I stayed in my room under my blankets.

Eventually I heard the loud angry footsteps of my ndad go down the stairs and out the door. I went over to that room and found my emom picking up the pieces. I asked her what happened. She said he threw the cup at her.

At one point in the day she leaves too. I am at home alone now.

I do whatever I want. I hear someone has come home. I check window and see ndad's car back. After knowing that he had been this morning I got scared.

I picked up the scissors in my room and stood next to my bedroom door. At the time I did that without thinking. I figured I needed to prepare to protect myself.

He opened my door and he handed me my favorite food at the time. Some fried chicken from Tops. Btw, there was no fried chicken places where we lived.

I was pretty much taken aback.

I told my friend this story and she laughed. I was really scared at the time. I think I was preparing to stab him if he did anything. It was just me in the house and only me I could rely on. 

Maybe he would've died if I hadn't decided to wait first.

I think that fired chicken thing was a love bombing thing. He didn't do anything to apologize to my emom.

That idiot had an appendix bust and refused to go to the hospital. Thetefore he took out his pain on us. Verbally. Until the day he threw the cup at emom. He waited on it so long that it became life threatening. Had he gone in earlier, we wouldn't have lost a bunch of money. Because of his stupidity and pride we suffered. He hurt us.

When he was in the hospital, I felt no sympathy for him. I didn't even want to see him. Nor did I care. It was one of the most peaceful times I had in middle school.

I didn't realize it at the time but I knew somehow he was making our lives worse. The only thing that I care about him is whether or not he can bring in the money to support us. I no longer cared to have a mother or father.

I wish I could've lived completely on my own my whole life. Without them causing me misery. If only there was a way for kids to live on their own. I was never going to subject myself to the horror of foster care. Its like a lottery to get an even worse situation.

Its such a simple story. I wish that maybe he was more of a failure. Then maybe itd be more apparent to my mom that we should abandon him. Disgusting awful man.

Practice is my escape, and I really did enjoy the sport for most of the time I've played. Last season, my stats were out of this world. I was among the best performers (if not, the best) on my team. And I really worked for it. I spent up to six hours working out every day during quarantine and it really showed up in my game. But during that time, I'd been staying with relatives, and once I moved back home, everything took a turn for the worst. 

Just for context, I slept on the couch at my house, and so did she because we lived with relatives. She refused to get us our own apartment because it was a ""waste of money."" And eventually, I realized no matter how much I tried to get through to my mom, she would not care. But I refused to stop trying. And that's when it came back to bite me in the butt. 

This past summer season, my performance on my team has improved immensely defensively, but while I used to be among the best offensive players, I dropped to sitting the bench during big games. My mom saw this and grew extremely angry about it, and in an emotional outburst told my coach I was no longer doing workouts at home and I had stop putting in the effort to improve my performance. 

She then went on to make an insane contract that I had to complete within about two and a half weeks of I wanted to stay on the team. Write an essay about accountability, write about three people in leadership, start a gratitude journal, and the most absurd request of all, lose 10 pounds in two weeks. 

This contract sent me into a complete spiral and while I was en route to get recruited for college sports, I was seriously considering just quitting. Somehow I got lucky and before the two weeks ended my mom told me both her best friend and boyfriend basically went ""what the hell are you doing?"" when she told them about it. And though she apologized to me, I do feel it was because they told her it was wrong and not because she cared about how I felt. The week prior we'd gotten into an argument and she said ""I don't care about your struggles, get over them. 

This past week, I attempted to set things right with my coach, who although I was one of his best performers until my mental health decline, said he completely agreed with my mom and was trying to convince me to leave the team. Though I was able to convince him to let me keep my spot, if I don't perform well this fall, I'm kicked off definitively. And during the entire conversation I tried to tell him my mom didn't tell him the full truth, and that I even had VIDEO PROOF of all my workouts (which my grandpa would take me to bcs my mom always had work), he didn't believe me. Straight up told me ""If you're putting the effort in, why did your mom tell me otherwise?"" And he insisted I was only upset because now I was about to lose my spot on the team. 

And that's when I realized my mom has completely ruined this for me. My reputation with my coach is completely ruined. My mom said it's either I play with this team or quit, and I do not see myself continuing with them past this fall. We just got a house finally, and now live two hours away one way from them. It would make more sense to find a new team, but it's not even a choice I have, and I feel the environment on this team isn't healthy for me to be in anymore.

I moved because:

1. I terribly missed my boyfriend, who lived on the other end of the US. My best friend and last IRL friend close enough to drive to had also moved 8 hours away. I had been living with my parents and very isolated for years, then COVID hit.

2. Trying to get a job where I was and dealing with so much rejection had worn me down and exacerbated my depression/anxiety 

3. I was developing c-ptsd from my nmom randomly either invading my personal space to yell at/verbally assault me or the sudden demand I go ""talk with her"" somewhere, resulting in her getting me alone to berate and yell at me. 

Everything she would throw at me happened 5+ years prior. Old grudges, some of which she held despite several attempts at reconciliation with major personality changes from me. I had long since apologized for things, gaslit and manipulated myself to apologize for some fucked up stuff I never should have, etc. I still apologized because I thought it would help her heal. It didn't.  She throws/threw things in my face no matter what. 

So I said fuck it, took a small inheritance I had, and left. I decided to go low contact. I horribly miss my dad, even if ultimately he was an enabler/peace keeper. I call my nmom once every two weeks. 

Two weeks ago, I called and she told me calling me is hard because of ""everything that happened"". I.E. Because I moved away and didn't meet her still unspoken expectations for how I'm supposed to me. I can't understand how I'm supposed to proceed. 

I want to call her so I can say hi. I'm moving on with my life and she has made it clear she's never going to forgive me for anything. But every other time I call she reminds me she's still hurt or angry at me as if I did jack shit to her when I didn't.  She abused ME. I'm not giving her a speck of sympathy anymore. I just can't. 

I'm finally no longer having long/volatile flashbacks and anxiety attacks every morning. I've even gone several days at a time without crying. I'm SO CLOSE to being strong enough to handle minor conflicts again and with more healing I'll be able to hold up a job again.

I have blown up from anger several times, and only then they seem to acknowledge their behavior - for a while. However, it is exhausting having to excalate every single argument.

I feel like I'm gaslighting my own feelings. Haven't spoken to my mother in 3 weeks after our last blow-up that revealed her narcissism. It's always been there of course.

He's also cordial with my mother so they speak on the phone randomly as well although both my brother and I are in our 30s, which is cool with me. He recently spoke to her about the situation and how I feel she laughed at my feelings when expressing them to her. She told him she didnt....of course!



The problem I am now facing is....I want her to call me and see why I haven't called her in so long especially after our last conversation. I feel like if your child expresses that you made them upset you should talk it out to fix it. I'm tired of always being the person to make 1st contact after a disagreement, and this is wirh most relationships in my life in general. I have moments that I think I should just go ahead and call her....but then I think what do I say?? Do I pretend everything is fine...I'm sure she will....and or answer saying hey stranger.

My narc mom cheated on my dad and this time my dad figured it out. My dad filed for divorce and left the house. My mom unilaterally decided to have one of the men she cheated on my dad with come live at our house even though she only knew the guy for a week. I was 12 and in a pretty vulnerable spot, having the family get torn apart like this, so confusingly. While the man lived with us, I could hear my mom and him have sex pretty much all the time. I didn’t really know what sex was, this was my introduction to it. There was moment, in particular, where I heard the phone ring and knew my mom had answered it; I asked her, through her closed bedroom door, who had called, and while she answered me, I realized she was having sex, and she didn’t even pretend to hide it or stop while she told me who had called.

I decided I needed to confront her about all of this, about how I needed her and felt betrayed that she was clearly more interested in her newfound sexual freedoms than in supporting her kids’ emotional needs. She didn’t apologize, but instead got angrier and angrier at me. The conversation ended when she yelled: “I have feelings too, you know!” I had long recognized she had feelings, but she had never done the same for me. 

In retrospect, I should’ve done everything I could to live with my dad, but my mom had spent my entire life telling me how horrible my dad was. Later, I found out everything she said about my dad was a lie, but it screwed up my relationship with my dad for years; I had been trained to not trust him. It was a real lost opportunity to have a closer relationship with him, which I regret.

But if you dig deeper, you will see they aren’t that smart or intelligent.

My narcissistic parents aren’t that smart with punishments. They always try to punish me with these “dumb” punishments, that don’t really feel like punishments.

One time two years ago, my narcissisistic father was acting shitty again and i stood up to him. And we were planning to go visit my sister at her appartement that day and eat there. And my narcissistic father said, “Okay, I'm going to your sister by car. If you wanna misbehave, i will not take you with my anymore, you will need to go on your bike”. Which was a pretty stupid punishment, because my sister’s appartement is 5 minutes away from our house. This “punishment” really didn’t affect me that badly. I told this my best friend, and she laughed and said, “Your father lets you go by bike? Yeah, you're really going to die from that” (sarcastically).

A couple of months ago, my Golden Child and narcissistic sister was trying to force me having sleepovers at her house, i kept refusing, because she’s abusive and cruel whenever i stay at her house. Until one time, my narcissistic sister yelled, “Well, i don’t wanna see you anymore ever! Bye!”. This wasn’t an very smart punishment of her, because she just gave me exactly what i wanted, and even more (Stop hanging out alltogether). Which i thought was very funny in a way.

I've lived here for the past 10 years of my life, having emigrated from a poorer part of Europe. 
For a while, I thought I was doing quite well in terms of ""living"" and ""adulting"" - handled and completed higher degrees, found jobs, got through several moves across and between countries, handled getting married and divorced and still done kinda okay..

For a while now, at least a couple of years, I haven't felt like I am doing too great...  I thought that by setting goals to advance beyond my starting baseline would help me feel better about myself, feel pride in my achievements and make life feel like its worth living. But I haven't felt that in ages. If anything, most aspects of my life look horrid from where I am standing and even though I have advanced from my starting baseline, I am still pretty much.... losing at the game called life.

I once had a passion - my work and education. I've lost that about 4 years after I got my PhD in a field I was truly passionate about. 

I am lucky to have had a job ever since I finished my PhD, but now the energy that kept me going in face of academic and office politics, energy which stemmed from curiosity and desire to find out new things and also teach people, has dissappeared. If anything I think it's all a sham and even within this ""masquarade"" I am not good, intelligent, knowleadgeable enough, nor do i feel like I have a voice. I do not feel like I can make good service to the values that once drove my energy for my work and I no longer believe in it. 
 Also I do not have great relationships with my co-workers. I always thought that by being nice and smiling, saying good things to people, would win me kudos. But actually, perhaps I just come across as aloof and strange to my colleagus in each of my jobs that I've held in the past 6 years (many, many short term contracts!). 
I have no idea if people generally dislike me, feel indifferent to me etc... the only advice I keep getting is that I shouldn't care but... I also cannot live in a bubble not knowing whether I offend people or push them away unwillingly. And maybe I don't but I still fail terribly at making any meaningful connections.

I thought that by diversifiying my social networks I'd feel more enriched by people's stories, experiences and would provide both a source of potential friendships and new, diverse activities. But after multiple tries, I gave up searching and trying....I only have my partner's friends to rely on (which I do regard as primarily his!), I haven't kept proper contact with my old friends (due to having to focus a lot on work for me to still have a job, when I still believed in it!) and I don't think they actually ever liked me or were ever more than indifferent to my existence. 

I tried rekindling old relationships frequently, but 90% I only speak to people if I initiate... And then I get forgotten.  Also, so much time has passed that I've lost touch with people's lifes and them with mine. So interactions are simply polite and out of politeness, when anyone has a bit of a free pocket of time to fill it (i.e. I would not have the courage to ask any of my friends to actively help with a house move or anything too onerous because that sort of closeness has never been there and it is less so nowadays). I cherish the times I do see them, but they are very few and I do tend to not be great at having a voice during get togethers. 

My family life is not great either. I take comfort and I am grateful for my fiance's family for accepting me. I have 2 family members close by - my mother doesn't really like me and I have felt rather comfortable on the Nparents threads on reddit. I am still trying to please her to feel accepted and despite that plus LC, things are not getting better so I am working actively on helping myself accept the bad situation for what it is. I also try to continuously see her point of view so that if I am criticised or yelled at, I feel better equipped to forgive those situations. 

My only other family member who I cherish highly is understandibly too busy with their own family and worries, hence too tired for connection. I haven't seen this person in at least 10months and last time we spoke on a videochat was around March. Again, just like with the friends situation - we kinda lost touch with each others lifes. And frankly, I think they are too tired, busy and have enough of their own stuff to deal with than to listed to me whine.

I havent enjoyed many things in many months, but I am constantly trying to ""do better"" and drag myself towards some goal. I continue to take medication for anx and depression. I have 2 therapists (one for past trauma and one for potential, self-diagnosed ASD). Drink alcohol socially once, max twice a week, without going overboard (given it could screw up my mood even more).  I have put on a lot of weight so I am trying to calorie count and get myself back into an exercise routine. But it all feels bleak. Ill do it, expend my entire energy/spoons for a day and then just want to go to bed at 9 and be on my own. If I could just not have to get out of bed at all and speak to no one at all that would be great... but also sad. I am a bit lucky that I am currently on holiday - so waking up later than 6-8 and trying to ""allow myself"", give myself permission to hide under the duvet in bed is okay. But once  go back to work - I wonder if i will still have any spoons for the new exercise routine and calorie count?
Where is my energy and will to ""live""? My motivation for anything at all. I know I should be doing a host of things - but I dont want to - too difficult, and for what? As I won't feel happy about any of these efforts anyway and reaching goals wont make me happier, as my history has taught me.
And I feel ashamed of it all. What a spiral of ""meh""!

I feel lucky to have a partner who loves and cherishes me and who still wants to marry me. It feels like the sole comfort I currently have in what seems otherwise like a void life. I cannot really see a happy or at least content future, with my having kids, a nice house etc. I feel like these outcomes are highly unlikely. I hate the thought that the way I feel right now might drive him away too, which would leave me utterly alone, as I have been before. And I would lose even the last good thing that is going for me... But I am almost willing to accept that too, Id rather he were happy than miserable like myself.

Sorry for the long post, but I am not sure tbh what my problem is or even where to start to make it better. But I do want to do better - surely, not everyone feels like this. Where to I start? Does anyone have any good advice for me? 

In short: All aspects of my life feel bleak and void despite efforts. I dont know why my life feels so broken and I don't know how to fix the parts that are indeed broken. I have 1 good thing going for me and I fear that my current mood, low energy and lack of motivation will drive this 1 good thing away also. In dire need of advice.

I have a older sister. When she was in high school, she was also discouraged to go to an university because, as my mom had said, universities are expensive. However, she went anyway, while she worked part time so hard to make money for a living and tuition.  And when I was in high school, I also thought that I wanted to go to an university because without a degree it's more difficult to get a job or does help somehow when you'd change your career. But my mom used guilt-trip to tell me indirectly (in a manipulative way) not to, i.e., If you went to a college, I'd have a hard time again as I did when your sister did that. 

How on earth could parents discourage their children about education, while that is the responsibility for them. 

She always put herself emotionally and physically before anyone. And she always told me your dad is a damn guy, even though he is an engineer. My dad stayed in silence all the time cuz he knew whatever statement he made wouldn't work for my mom, since she always scream and shout to stop anyone in my family from speaking  when she's at a disadvantage. And now I'm unemployed, facing and being under pressure from society that says unless you've got a degree you'd be not even on a resume scanning.

Background: I [23F] live in a different country to my dad [55M], parents are divorced, mom is aware of the situation, lives in another country still, I prefer to keep her an uninvolved as possible.

I will be visiting my home country, where my dad lives, in November for the first time since 2019. I am really struggling to decide how I want to approach interactions with my dad.

We’ve always had a tumultuous relationship, with main issues being him acting as a friend rather than parent, or on the flip side getting very aggressive when I wouldn’t show him ‘the respect he had to show his father’. You get the gist.

However, since I moved out and began working through my childhood issues, and establishing boundaries around them, things have significantly worsened. Whenever I try to enforce a boundary, I get barraged with aggressive messages about how ‘I’m just waiting for an excuse to cut him out’ and ‘he always knew it would come to this’. About a year ago I actually did cut contact for a while after a particularly nasty incident. Whenever things calm down, he becomes perfectly agreeable, checks in often, and is an exemplary parent. It doesn’t help that he’s prone to manic episodes, during which he sends me money out of nowhere - making me feel all the more guilty about debating cutting him out.

It is not possible for me to avoid seeing him during my trip without making it VERY obvious and hurtful that that’s what’s happening. So I’m stuck between two options: pretend things are fine and try to withstand the abuse and negging for a few days, or set boundaries ahead of time and risk armageddon before I even get there.

Worth noting: greyrocking does not work on my dad - or I’m doing it wrong. He does this ‘nipping’ thing where he’ll start with offhanded comments, and if he doesn’t get the desired reaction he keeps going and escalates until he does.

The gist is I got engaged in March 2020 just before all the lockdowns went into place in the US. My fiancé is a very sweet and loving man and we get along great, even though the past year has been really tough on both of us emotionally and mentally.

He wants to have kids despite having a similar relationship with his mom as I do. I have met his mom multiple times and she was definitely in a mostly loveless marriage with his father and appeared to latch onto my fiancé for companionship, like some parents do, though it’s inappropriate to rely on your kids like that. He set the record straight with her and they appear to be somewhat better now. But I can’t say the same thing for my mom. She has no filter and basically assumes she can get her way with pretty much everything, regardless of who she hurts in the process. She actually “thanked” my fiancé for going out with me on a Zoom call (like I’m some kind of freak) when we didn’t attend Thanksgiving 2020 at her house due to COVID though she still had my brother and his wife over. My brother later got COVID from that incident but has since recovered.

My mom has been extremely critical, controlling and borderline bullying for my entire life since I was growing up and constantly trying to meddle in my love life with unsolicited advice. I know she does this because she is a profoundly insecure person who hated her dad growing up for choosing work over his family but she lacks the self-awareness to not use her children like therapists or recognize how her actions alienate people. She at one point told two strangers waiting for a plane at the airport that she hates my tattoos and “wishes she could cut them off and replace them with skin grafts” because she finds them trashy. Two random strangers, waiting for a plane. I was 19 at the time. And she thinks that makes her more relatable.

I’m not against having kids, even though I do like the way things are now with him, but my previous experiences with her left such a traumatic impact on me that I doubt I have the emotional and mental health resiliency to not go down the same path that she did. 

I’ve had major depression bouts since I was 9, insomnia, eating disorders, weight issues, self-worth issues and been in 3 abusive relationships with narcissistic men. I held off on dating for 3 years and got therapy to try to get over my resentment and anger. Now she is trying to interfere with my wedding planning despite the boundaries I’ve put into place. If she keeps it up, I won’t invite her there period. 

The general question I have is, are there any other people on here who weren’t sure about having kids based on how you were raised? Did you end up having them or not and how did it affect your life going forward?

If you remember me, I posted about my JnDad aka the Narcissus (ManChild) and somewhat of a JNoNmom, with a sprinkle of Grandma the Grinch who steals our Christmas presents and knows someone's family relations better than her own.

I started therapy 2 months ago, about a weekly 1.5 hour session, thankfully it's free due to me being a student. I cried for 80% of my sessions. Straight up went back down the memories, started talking and choking up. It felt so weird, therapist sat across silently and watched without saying anything, but *they were there*. I felt their presence, I felt like I'm being listened to. I also felt like I'm suffocating her. I couldn't and didn't want to get down to all types of ""incidents"" we had at home. Halfway through my current sessions... she asks *the question*. How often did it get physical. And I let it all rip, all incidents I could remember ~10 years backwards.


I didn't cry. It was normalcy for me - i know it isn't normal, but it's something I'm used to. Therapist sat with eyes full of tears. Then proceeded to tell me there's a lump in their throat and they needed a moment. Didn't really cry but I could tell in their eyes they were about to. Minus that, there was a few times when she referred to my nparents' name calling and yelling as abuse. Verbal abuse. I knew it was just that. It's just no one's ever outright said it. I feel both lighter and calmer with someone validating my experiences and acknowledging them. But also I feel like a liar, if I were to mention to my parents that they've been verbally abused I'd be gaslit into thinking I deserved it or that it never happened.


It's a lot to take in. Especially since therapy goes so deep down, I get physically and mentally exhausted.

Just stayed at home in my teens I developed severe social anxiety when I had to go out by my own. I would start having a panic attack every time I had to talk to someone. My father constantly shamed for being a weirdo and not being independent enough although it was because of the way I was raised but I did make efforts to act normal. I was somewhat successful in that.

I know to anyone it may sound so weird and laughable but I was so hurt. I felt like a weirdo who knows nothing. Although after that I had to literally fight with my father to allow me to use my card and I learned everything but it still feels so bad.

My childhood dog (who was like a daughter to me, super attached to me) was put down in October 2018. 

First of all (for needed context), my mother would overfeed my dog her medication, in hopes of “curing” her or treating her better. She confessed this to me in tears after my dog died. She worried it contributed to her needing to be put down. She hid my dog’s medicine from me when i wanted to do research to see what natural ways I can help alleviate her pain (like CBD oil etc). Just to help in any way. She vehemently denied me even knowing what the medicine was called. Furthermore, when my dog was literally dying after injection, she weakly turned her head towards me, and my mother forced her head to turn towards her instead, saying “look at *me*, my baby”… as if she didn’t let my dog go RAIL THIN when I away for a month. So my mother was the last thing my dog saw. Not both of us, or even me. Just my mom. I was a complete mess after that. And I still don’t forgive my mom for what she did.

For a few months, I couldn’t stand sleeping alone without my dog. I was the only one in my house who slept alone. My parents had each other, my sister had her chihuahua, I had nothing but an empty bedside where my dog would sleep every single night. So I decided to adopt a different species, since I didn’t want to feel like I was replacing my dog, and I just wanted a new baby to care for and cuddle with at night.

So I got my cat, and named her Astra. My mom would curse and yell about “getting rid of that cat” when she was too shy to come out from under my bed the first few months. My mom gave up on her so easily. It was emotionally hard for me, but I didn’t. 

After my cat finally came out &amp; started warming up to me/familiarizing herself, my mom forced my cat out of my room and into hers, saying she wasn’t allowed in my room. I made my cat a custom litterbox that looks like a pot of flowers, I bought her litter, the best cat food, etc. Yet she was close to my mom. And still is, more so. Because she’s been conditioned to be by her side, not me. And I still sleep alone. And I’m angry. I’m so angry. 

I’ve confronted my mom about this one time, and just as expected, she denies it with yelling and cursing, then asks “what’s wrong with you”, etc. My mom has even told me to stop feeding my cat, because it’s her job now. 

My heart is beyond the realm of broken. I miss my dog. And Astra was supposed to be my new baby. Yet now she treats me almost like a stranger, and meows when my mom is gone, sitting outside her room. It hurts. A lot. She won’t come into my room, or stay very long. It’s not familiar anymore.

I have given up. No matter what I’m her legal owner and she’s still my baby, but emotionally it doesn’t feel like it. And I think when I move out I will leave her with my mom. It’s just that Astra was my special name for her… it means “from the stars.” When I adopted her at a rescue site, her name was Naleli… which means star. I thought that was an insane coincidence, that it was meant to be. Hell, when I looked at her documents, she was literally rescued on my BIRTHDAY two years prior, at just 1 month old. I guess I was wrong. I’m just sad.

My mom has ruined so much for me in my life. She has shit in my dreams, stolen money from me, called me a whore at 15 just because I developed early, made me feel utterly worthless. My list makes a cvs receipt look like a post-it. But all of that pales in comparison to this. I’m upset.

I was inspired by someone else's experience here and I thought of sharing this story.

My NM has an apartment in a safe part of the city.

It is pretty and small, plus she doesn't have to pay a mortgage for it. So she lives in a rent-free, mortgage-free home.

However, since I moved in a year ago, I noticed that she has serious black mold problems. I found black mold behind a wardrobe in my room, on the bathroom walls, in the other rooms, in the kitchen, and so on.

I sincerely believe her entire house is infested with mold and it's been that way since I was small (for 20 something years). Sooo, I decided to tell her that she might be dealing with mold and that mold is dangerous. She got upset and told me it is only 'black dirt' (who does she think she's fooling with that distorted idea of hers?).

Know what she did? 

She got a pot of warm water and a cloth and started wiping the wall that was affected by mold in my room. She said 'See, you can scrape it off, so it's not mold.' Of course, the mold is still there, nothing came off. 

I later sent some photos to a woman who has experience in analyzing and identifying mold in homes and she confirmed that it's mold (the bad kind).

I have special nasal sprays that keep my airwaves in shape and I feel fine so, hopefully, I won't be affected by it until I move out. However, she is literally putting her life in danger because of the mold and dragging my disabled father into this, too.

I don't think she'll do something about it because denial is better than reality. 

It's really sad to see someone wasting their health like this when there are so many solutions to deal with mold and so much to do to prevent lung disease or other serious health issues that mold causes. 

I mean, even selling this apartment for a lower price and buying a small home outside the city (they're cheap in my area) is a much healthier choice.

They did that with my higher education. They said we will provide everything and pay for everything as long as you study while staying at home. I ended up studying business instead of psychology which i had been my dream. The only college near our home provided business as an option or engineering. 

Then when I wanted to marry a guy they wouldn't allow me to marry him and in my culture that's considered bad so my I couldn't marry the guy I liked.

Yeah, you read that right. She has accused me of leaving my son out and not thinking about my partner, saying my partner works harder than me and that I should really be a stay home mum.

Because she has never worked in her life and managed to flout the benefits/welfare system, she has this very distorted view on what family life is, and just life in general tbh. She doesn't realise that every family is different and that not everyone is able to cheat the system and live off benefits. There's lots of families with both parents working, but where she has no friends or family, she doesn't know how the real world works and that it's very much normal. She's a very sheltered person, I feel kinda sorry for her in a weird way.

She has been trying to pit my partner against me, telling him ""I don't like what she's doing to you and your son"", going on like she knows our lives and agreements, sucking up to him and saying he works really hard etc...

She has managed to twist things and made out I'm the bad person for getting upset at her for making a nasty comment about me working the other day. My partner is now mad at ME, accusing me of causing him stress and being dramatic about the entire situation. 

I called her this morning to try and talk and explain things. She literally starts off saying ""You know I'm right"" and when I tried to explain that if she was concerned about my partner and our working lives, she could've just spoke to him instead of making an embarrassment of herself and making me upset and angry. SHE had the audacity to start crying over the phone and cut the call. For reference, she posted the vile comment on a Facebook photo I posted of me working at a community day thing. I had people reply, message me and what not saying she was bang out of order and asking if i was ok and were extremely shocked to see that it was my mum who made the horrific comment. 

She's done this before to my cousins, made vile comments about their parenting and own lives, thinking she knows best and what not. This is why she has no one. Not even her brother and sisters want anything to do with her, because she thinks she's superior but deep down, she's really really insecure so she projects it onto others, especially if they are happy or have some sort of success/good news.

She always thinks she's right. She assumes when people get upset or angry it's because they acknowledge that she's right, when reality is, people get annoyed with her because her behaviour is totally immature and unnecessary. 

She has pushed almost everyone away because of her constant ""I'm always right"" attitude. She doesn't get invited to family meals or coffee meets or a trip to the pub. When my uncle died (who was married to my mum's sister), the first thing my aunt did was call me and came round because she wanted support but knew she wouldn't get any from my mum. My mum never had friends and growing up we had to constantly keep moving because she kept causing trouble with the neighbours. Yet she doesn't see herself as the problem, but everyone else. She'll never realise it.

In her eyes she'll always be right. Yet, she's a very bitter, entitled, lonely person who's hitting her fifties and has never had any kind of success. I know it makes her insecure, seeing family around her being successful, having friends, jobs, getting married and engaged, getting mortgages etc. She tries and hide her insecurities by lashing out at others for literally no reason. 

I honestly don't know how she can look at herself and think what she's doing is perfectly normal. It's not normal to always think you're right, criticise others yet get upset when people do the same to you and think the world revolves around you.

And that your Golden Child siblings got a better treatment, than you the Scapegoat? The narcissistic parent has fooled you. This isn’t true. The narcissistic parents have made it look like that to you just to make you feel like you did something wrong. But just because it looks like that, doesn’t mean it’s true. The Golden Child doesn’t have it better and here’s why:

1. The Golden Child never see through the abuse of the narc parents. The Scapegoat does:

Partly the reason why you’re the Scapegoat is because you saw through the bullshit of your narcissistic parents and actually have the guts to stand up to them. Some Golden Childs will never see this. I have an Golden Child sister and she always advocates for ny narc parents their abuse and will always tolerate it, no matter what. Being the Golden Child is sad, because they lack the self-respect to stand up for themselves.

2. The Golden Child never breaks free from the narcissist. The Scapegoat do:

This is because of the reason i mentioned above. The Golden Child doesn’t have the guts to stand up to the narcissistic parents, let alone break free and go no-contact! But the Scapegoat will, because of the reason that they stop tolerating the abuse.

3. The Golden Child doesn’t have an identity of their own. The Scapegoat do:

The reason why you’re the Scapegoat isn’t because you’re the problem. It’s because you actually have an identity and life outside the narcissist, and that is what they don’t like. But the Golden Child doesn’th have these things. And it’s sad, because my Golden Child sister is incapable of making her own decisions and incapable of having her own personal opinions as she’s so dependant and obiedent on my narcissistic mother and she will never fully grow up. It must be horrible to be the Golden Child!

4. The Golden Child goes through abuse, just like the Scapegoat:

This is a thing we often forget, but always have to remember. The Golden Child got abused, too. Yes, in a different way, but abuse is abuse, no matter what. The Golden Child didn’t got less abuse as the Scapegoat, they’re as broken as us, just a different kind of broken. But broken. I witnessed it myself once, when my narcissisitic mother was on the phone with my Golden Child sister, i heard my narc mother being abusive to my GC sister.

5. The Golden Child is incapable of building geniune relationships. But the Scapegoat do:

I see this often with my Golden Child sister as her relationships always fail or they’re not genuine. Because she always expects to be treated like a Queen, if people don’t treat her like that, she throws them in the trash. My GC sister would throw a temper tantrum if her friends forget it’s her birthday, and she will stop hanging out with them, untill they wish her Happy Birthday.

Long story short, I moved 1200 miles from home and never looked back. I’ve had to learn to do basic adult things on my own and one of the big ones was dental care.

My mother and I speak occasionally (she calls to complain about my dad, I just relay new events that have happened in my life) and the subject of my dental care comes up. She’s surprised by the amount of work I need done but then she quickly forgets and rants about my dad instead. A few weeks go by before I get the call where she tells me she found the paperwork from the last time she had taken me to the dentist. It was a big deal because she had gotten dentures at the same time I had last been in. She started to brag to me that it had been 15 years since that last visit. “Can you believe it?” 

She actually bragged to me that it had been so long and how everything had turned out fine. 15 years. I had to have two wisdom teeth removed because they came in crooked and were useless, 11 fillings, and I have dental cleanings every 3 months because of periodontal disease.

An example: mine would not spend time with me and my partner and said would only meet with me individually. 

(Compared to my other parent who wanted to spend some time with just me on a recent visit, but was very amiable to several meals with my partner there.)

Plus N-parent hugs in such an odd way. Extends arm out and places open hand on the back of my neck. Then pulls me close. (I think most people place their hand and attached arm on shoulders and upper back rather than neck. Also, it isn't so much a pull of the person towards you as a mutual moving towards each other.) 

I call it a boa constrictor hug and have banned N-parent from doing that specific thing. They do this silly laugh as though is so cute and hysterical but does respect my absolute refusal to engage in such a hug. Which is good for my sanity. 

(By the way, I vary between minimal contact due to being busy, due to not liking N-parent very much, and outright avoidance due to stuff they have said or done that so far misses the mark on the things I say will be meaningful to me that I feel irritated. Or we get into arguments cuz hold her to the same respectful communication standard I ask of everyone in my life. I moved far away and that helped a lot.

So I am a 14 year old girl in an unsafe home. I am torn between just toughing it out an living with my abusers until I'm a bit older, or just running away. My relationship with my mother is awful. She screams at me over everything and nothing. She's always screaming at the top of her lungs, and somehow I've always done something bad. It could be something as small as leaving a mug in my room, and she would scream for hours and cause fights, that continue for days. She is also constantly taking my phone, over literally nothing at all, meaning I can't talk to my long-distance best friend. She also makes hurtful comments about my weight/food intake. And she says that I'm faking my depression for attention and emotional blackmail. She's constantly invalidating my feelings and saying things like, ""you'd be less annoying dead than alive"" and saying I'm ""selfish"" and ""don't care about anyone but myself"" when I make a mistake, such as accidentally spill something. She also physically harms me when she gets really, really mad. And we've gotten into full-blown punch ups before. This abuse and fighting is constant and she is never nice to me. My relationship with my dad is better more often than my mum and I's, however he has given me trauma due to his out of control anger issues. He has told me he didn't want me anymore, called me a c\*nt, a f\*cking idiot, and so much more. He has also pushed me and slammed my head into walls and pushed my neck up against the wall several times. I also live with my 2 sisters who relentlessly bully me, far past the point of normal sibling rivalry. They bullied me into an eating disorder and several suicide attempts. Long story short, I have a very toxic household and absolutely hate it here. It is so damaging for my mental health and I do not want to live in a house with them. I want to run away. The only problem is, I have no-where planned to go, and I don't want to get the police/authorities involved in any way. So that kinda means I might have to just live here until I can get a job and move out. Staying with anyone I know presently is out of the question. On the other hand, I do not want to live in a foster home. And if I do go out on the streets and try to find somewhere on my own, I could end up in a much worse situation.

I simply want to set some boundaries because my mother is not the kindest person and I want to take control of my own life.

- Can I get vaccinated?

(TLDR; my parents were abusive fuckbags).

Called me, ""The Bow-legged (expletive)"", a very special pet name for me.  Called this often.  Don't understand why... I was skinny due being underfed, did my legs look bowed?  That's a lack of calcium.  I don't think I'm bow-legged now.  So confusing.

Called my sister a ""truck-stop skank.""  Called my brother ""Harold"" (his name isn't Harold, was done w sarcasm.  Not sure why ""Harold"" was chosen.  Not a goodly-based reason, I'm sure.

Punched my brother in the face at least once... saw it while I was hiding across the street in bushes at the neighbour's.  Dad cracked my brother right accross the face.  Saw w my own eyes.  The reason?  He'd come home late.  Saw my brother crying, after this incident.

When I was in 1st or 2nd grade, informed me that ""I love you bc you're my child, but I don't *like* you"".  
You don't ever forget that type of statement.

Went away to camp for a week or so one summer.  Upon return, was informed, ""When you were away at camp, your siblings didn't miss you at all"" by one parent, in the dark garage, just the two of us.  Now, I knew this was a lie, I loved my siblings to the bone &amp; knew they loved me also - we are all friends for life, to this day.  Sick parent just wanted to hurt me.

""IncitefulInsights is not good at *anything*""

""Whatever IncitefulInsights does, do the opposite"" (a mantra they tried to instill in my siblings)

Did not purchase clothing or shoes for me.  I had to steal shoes as a teenager.  BC of my religious upbringing I was scared to steal from any store, so I stole from the lost-and-found at school - this was somehow acceptable to me.  I developped &amp; executed an elaborate plot &amp; stole the shoes out of the lost &amp; found in the gym teacher's office.  The result was me ending up wearing ill-fitting, worn-out shoes some other kid had ""lost"" (or cast off).  I knew even whose shoes they were originally - whenever that kid would see me wearing the shoes, they would look at my feet, then give me the wierdest look.  I think the kid knew I ""stole"" their shoes.  BONUS: one of my parents *worked at the school*.  They saw me wearing the lost-&amp;-found shoes, shoes they didn't buy me, and said *nothing*.

Did not provide sufficient food, so I was underweight.  Shamed me for what food I DID eat.  

Shamed me for my acne, blamed me for having acne.  Said it was bc I ""ate too much chocolate"".  I liked chocolate, sometimes bought myself a chocolate treat, they begrudged my liking chocolate, having a treat.  Made fun. Blamed me liking chocolate for my normal teenage acne, expected my skin to be 100% clear all the time, or else it was my fault.  Ridiculed me for seeking a dermatologist's care to treat my pretty-severe acne which WAS NOT caused by eating chocolate, but ultimately, hormones.  Gaslighted me by first paying for my acne treatment drugs prescribed by dermatologist, w their insurance plan; then suddenly demanding I give them the money back ""bc I owed them"" or withholding reimbursement for said drugs I'd paid for out-of-pocket when I was still a minor covered by their insurance plan.

Resented my small earnings from a part time job, tried to make me pay for ""services"" in my own home as would be expected to pay for services in a hotel.  Wanted my part time job money.

Shamed me for using toilet paper bc it costs money.  They ""shouldn't have to pay"" for (my) toilet paper.

Accused me of theft for using hygiene products in the house.  Using hygiene products stored in a bathroom cabinet was ""stealing"".  ""You took all the xxxx!"" when I had taken just only what I needed and legitimately for hygiene purposes.  If they saw I used any, that was ""stealing"" it.

Whenever something went missing in the house, assumed I had ""stolen"" it.  Talked loudly &amp; repeatedly  about me being the thief/culprit of having ""stolen"" the missing item, in my/my sibling's presence.  Told me many times, ""you're a thief!"" if something got lost or went missing in the disorganized mess of a household.

Made me feel unwelcome in my own home to the point I got rid of most of my possessions so as not to take up any space... my room consisted of just a bed/bedding, an empty shelf and maybe an empty desk or something.  I had a small closet upon which I self-installed a lock with key - I had the only key.  They hated that, but for some reason, tolerated me keeping my small qty of stuff (mostly about 3 or 4 day's clothes rotation, some books, and a few sentimental trinketts given me by relatives who genuinely loved me, but lived far away) in the locked closet, thus taking up little space and my presence in the home not being at all visible.

Did not do my laundry of the few clothes I did have, or did a slovenly job.  Around age 12-13 I taught myself to do my own laundry by *watching the washing machine*, opening the lid &amp; watching the dial at diff parts of the cycle to see how things worked, learning the laundry cycle.  Thereafter I was able to appropriately launder my own clothes (actually, maybe that was a blessing as it's a life skill- one I self-taught to myself.

Did not assist me w homework or schooling beyond 2nd grade, then punished me for bringing home bad grades.  Teachers tried to send notes home to find out what was going on, but I always hid the notes bc I feared wrath &amp; didn't understand what was in the notes, just that I would be punished for getting them.

Forced me into difficult, highly avoidable awkward situations... that's a whole can of worms....caused me to lose touch with friends.

Wanted me to get a serious, money-earning job at 12 or 13.  Saw me &amp; my siblings as ready for the workforce &amp; ready to take over personal expenditures around age 12-13.  Demanded we all get jobs out of the blue one day in the middle of the summer.  One day, we're carefree playing outside w the neighbourhood kids, the next, we're all obliged to be looking for serious jobs.  A ""job search"" was organized by parents for us, featuring idiocy including loading us all into the van, carting us kids all around town in the van to every fast-food joint, &amp; forcing us to go in &amp; fill out job applications.  None of which were ever replied to.  When that failed, the next step was more serious:   bringing us 12 &amp;13 yr olds to the *Government employment office* to hunt for jobs on the job board there (this was well-before internet was a thing).  Place stank, was super-depressing, and full of unnemployed adults, mostly immigrant men.   The jobs posted there were adult-oriented &amp; not meant for 12-13 year old kids.  Stuff like, ""Senior Buyer"", ""Engineer"", or ""Head Office Manager"".  We wandered all around, looking for something we were qualified, could apply to, while one parent watched.  Spent a goodly amount of time in the govt employment office that summer, assessing whether we were qualified to apply as ""Production Line Supervisors"" or ""Accounts Receivable Bookkeepers"". Parents also put a ton of effort that summer into  getting all of us set-up w official Social Insurance Numbers &amp; cards, to be ready to enter the workforce.   In retrospect, this ended up being a good thing to have done, but it came not from a place of wanting to do right by us, but rather of wanting us to become income-earners at age 12 and 13.  Guess parents were tired of having ""freeloading"" kids.  Especially the stay-at-home-rotter.

Asked me if I knew ""who paid for that peanut butter?"" I dared to eat.

As soon as they knew I had a bit of income, wanted to begin charging rent.  One parent was stay-at-home, never worked a day.  But always flush with cigarettes &amp; beer of course.

In high school I wanted desprately to play one particular sport I thought was the coolest thing ever.  Found a local team &amp; independantly made contact.  Somehow convinced my parents to let me join, they paid the fees.  They initially supported me in participating in the sport, but as time went by, began making fun of me for liking it &amp; mocking my efforts to learn it (I was a late starter).  They began holding over my head, threats to pull funding / take me out.  Involved my coaches in their craziness, calling them up &amp; telling them things.  As time went by I began to see support for me in this sport wane, to the point there was outright disapproval of my continuing to like it &amp; want to do it.  Finally parents *did* pull funding &amp; support, forcing me out, out of something I truly enjoyed, making fun of me all the while &amp; gloating at my disappointment.  They always loved seeing me disappointed &amp; ashamed - I knew this &amp; wasn't surprised by their behaviour.  They revelled in trying to convince me they took me out bc I was no good at the sport anyway, &amp; was ridiculous I even wanted to try.  I wasn't the best granted, but I had good skills in certain areas &amp; was working to better myself.  

Didn't feel well at school one day.  Went to nurse.  She called my parent, asked if I could come home.  Parent said ""no... stay at the school!""

But I reinitiated contact 2 days ago. And it’s relevant that I used to do his wound care all the time when I was in nursing school. I had hoped to hold on to living with him, but he kicked me out when my mom left. 

So my dad called me and these are my impressions from the phone call: 

he started out just saying that it wasn’t important but then he started talking about his legs. He said the chronic wounds on his legs were acting up and he started asking me advice about wound care dressings

But he kept circling back to allude to the fact that he wanted someone (me) to come over and do wound care on him. So I told him…

 I said “please let me cut you off. You need home health. I don’t know if you have a Case Manager from all your previous surgical cases…. or if you need one… but YOU need to advocate for the case manager to refer you to home health wound care.”

And he said no.

So then we started kind of talking about our schedules and he was carrying on for a very long time about when he thought his Amazon package of his wound care supplies that he ordered himself would be delivered….

But i interrupted him again, and said, “you know what…. if you need me I will come over but I’m working on Thursday and I’m only available little bit on Wednesday… but if you call me…. I would come and you don’t have to say another word about it.”

So then he talked for a really long time about how embarrassed he was, and how he didn’t want his family to know, and his doctor to know: that his legs were acting up. He just wanted to put these wound care dressings on them.

And so I said “OK listen… maybe this isn’t the most professional thing but I do have friends and sometimes I call on them to do simple assessments over the phone or….sometimes it’s really a doctor…or… I know wound care nurses….. This situation is outside of the realm of professionalism… but i could refer you to a friend of mine to get an initial assessment.  

She might say “go ahead and do your own stuff” or “you should get hydrafera blue dressings” or “you really need to go to to the hospital.” But I could phone a friend. 

And!

I know a case manager to who could like look at your stuff and she’d be able to tell you…” oh Aetna insurance, I completely understand, I know exactly what Documentation i need to authorize you for a home health wound care nurse.”

And then he kind of started getting weird… like “I don’t know why I asked you for advice. I don’t mean to sound hostile…but just Nevermind!! and I just I didn’t even mean to ask you. Just don’t tell anyone!!”

And I said “well I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable I was offering you several solutions.

“so where did we leave  it?

“Do you want me to come over to do wound care or do you want me to ask my friends to assist you with your case management or wound care needs…or like…when? What time?”

And he was all of a sudden obviously in a bad mood and he said in like the most sarcastic way…he’s like “you know what “Name” I love you, I got everything I needed. thanks” and then he hung up.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713391,public,self,What happened here?

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 21F.  History of self harm, depressive episodes and general anxiety. I'm an only child,  a third year university student, aiming for grad school (med school hopefully) and live with a single mom. 

I cook all the meals, I clean, do the chores, I study and work - my moms very sick so she can't do things very quickly. From a young age I've been helping out.

My moms gone through a lot of abuse, struggles and has a chronic illness - shes also a shining example of an amazing professional, has 3 masters degrees, speaks multiple languages and is the peak of ""going through it tough but surviving""

She's also a Narcissistic Martyr - undiagnosed, but you'll see why as I continue below. 

NOTE: I NEVER DISS SOMEONES TRAUMA AND LIFE EXPERIENCES, BUT I DO NOT AGREE WITH HURTING OTHERS AS A RESULT OF IT. 

I'm her personal punching bag, I've had to be her friend, mother at times, support, confidant, daughter... everything. Boundaries are not a thing. Privacy, lol, forget it.

Growing up I was always walking on eggshells.

Didn't go to prom.

Didn't go to school dances (in middleschool nor HS)  (I did go to one in elementary)

Had my phone checked often...

Was not allowed to hang out with friends often - mostly only for birthday parties or specific events,  and when I did she had to either be there or know the parents and if I was allowed to - it was for a short time only.

As a young child - fine I accepted this. After all my safety was her priority.

But it just made me sneakier?

Went to an all girls school for my whole school-education.

Long story short I got a BF at 17. 

Fell in love, puppy love of course, and decided to tell my mom.

She disagreed (for many reasons: distraction to studies, he wasn't from our ethnic background (awful i know), he wasn't good enough for me)

""Break up with him"" She said, as I sat across her over lunch.

""But why?"" 

""I don't like him, no. Breakup""

ANd so I did.  
But I kept seeing him around at tutoring centre where I was enrolled, and for both of us who were shy, academically focused kids, this was a beautiful moment.

So for several weeks we broke up.

This ruined me, and I felt awful, it was exciting and happy for me to get a little valentines card, to have some affection. I was 17, studying hard to get into my college of choice.

I felt obliged to do what she said. 

But I felt compelled to not do it either.

I was self harming, slowly at first. Across my thighs and my stomach. IT gave me release. Don't ask me why, it just did.

And then we got back together secretly.

Seeing him was an hour or so here, a few minutes there. Some small drives. 

It was nothing disastrous. Dangerous or wrong.

But I felt guilty. I felt like the worst person on earth. I wanted to share the cute little moments with my mom. Something I had thought all girls will do ! She always told me to trust her and tell her everything - yet over the years I had noticed everything I told her would come back to bite me in an argument...

I had snuck him home one day - for only an hour (where we cooked a little as i had to have food ready before my mom came home) and spent time together.

And when my mom found out I did this.

Well, naturally, I was called a whore.

A lying.

Disobedient.

Whore.

(I hadn't even had sex but she never believed that)

Fights ensued, my phone was taken. Hair was pulled. 

She told him never to contact me again. And for months I was forced to go everywhere with her. Glued so she can watch me. So she can make sure I wasn't doing it again.

She read my private messages aloud and called me names for hours. 

My self harm flared and got worse. 

Im 21 and the scars havent really faded.

One day she saw my scars. I was changing and she walked in, I quickly tried to hide them but she forced me to show her my stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

""why would you do this? why would you do this to me? You want to hurt me?""

huh?

Hurt her. I was hurting her?

I couldn't come to her with my concerns or issues - she told me not to trust my friends because they all want the worst for me, she said people will look badly upon me because im a dirty whore for lying about having a boyfriend and she called up my friends to ask them what they knew.

""You wasted your senior year, you got bad marks, you were more interested in boys, you disregard everything ive gone through for you"".

....

Flash forward to now, Im 21. Fights continue every few months. When I do what she says, all things are fine.

But I can't go anywhere! Without her express knowledge, without her taking me there herself and waiting in the car for me ""**BUT ITS FOR YOU OWN SAFETY I CANT HAVE YOU DRIVING SO FAR AWAY""**

Privacy is still not a thing for me.

If i want privacy, its because I want  to hide something. 

Because *from a young age I have shown that I am a lying, selfish, lazy, whore*.

She wants me to find a nice guy from our culture - but if I meet someone she insists on reading all the texts, taking me to and from dates, listening in on calls... safe to say I've only dated one guy in the last 3 years since, and that was only 3 dates cause he had enough of her meddling (and fair enough)

  
Over the years I've just gotten sneakier, I'm an adult, I have friendships she can't control, and thoughts she can't overpower. I try my best to be resilient, and not fall into self harm again (although have relapsed countless times).

Our fights are constant, horrific and often get violent. 

And it all goes back to her point**: ""ever since you were 17 everything changed, you're not the daughter I knew""** 

**Lazy**

Selfish

**Ungrateful**

**Bitch**

**Whore** 

Crazy

&amp;#x200B;

I mean these are only a few of the epithets Ive hard chiseled into my heart from my mother.

My loving mother; who sacrificed her whole life to have me.

""Ive gone through so much, I've given up everything, other mothers go out and have fun and I sacrificed all of this to raise you, I should've brought other men into the house but I didn't i stayed by you I didnt have any other relationships, you turned my house into a brothel! "" (by bringing my then boyfriend over)

You're ungrateful, you're spoiled, I've given you too much freedom and too much opportunity and you respect nothing. I've been sick with my chronic illness and I worked so hard to raise you and this is how you repay me?

...

I usually ignore these fights, they usually occur after I try to set a boundary.

""Dont touch my phone"" her answer: I PAY For that phone I get to see it.

""I can't come to you with my problems because you gaslight me and you yell at me"" her answer: ""YOU KNOW ITS THE WRONG THING AND YOU DO IT ANYWAY"".

I cant afford to move out, so I live with her still.

  
Anyway, now I have a boyfriend.   
The love of my life, the man I'm hoping I will marry, cause we both come from abusive single-parent homes and we understand each other well.

Anyway he's not from my culture (but i mean i literally do not give a shit ? No one CHOOSES their race?? And can I just say all of this culture business is covert racism and I do not give a fuck about endorsing it)

he's the most respectful, caring, supportive amazing human being and he loves me truly.

But **NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU LIKE ME, YOUR MOTHER DOES.**

**NO ONE.**

Eh. I call bullshit. Because the older i've gotten the more I can see her flaws. She makes mistakes. Shes not the omniscient god she portrays herself to be, and iM sorry she's not a flawless martyr. It's NOT my responsibility to fill the voids in her life or to fix the abuse she went through.

Hurt people, hurt people. I get it. But i've had enough.

She never takes responsibility for hurting me, everything that I point out is disrespectful or wrong is disregarded because I am the child. ""The feet cannot hit the head"" I am the feet - my moms the head... so regardless of what she says or does. She is correct.

Always.

She knows better.

Anyway, she says I've changed recently (she doesn't know me and my bf are dating she knows we are friends) and I ignore her. 

In our most recent argument where I said I've had enough of her invasion of my privacy. Shit hit the fan.

You're spending too much time talking to that guy, (he had given me notes for some classes and she picked them up and threw them everywhere on the ground)

things escalated I cant even be bothered to go into detail, y'all already know how these things snowball. I went into my room packed a bag and said fuck this. im leaving.

Yeah I had $300 in my bank account and nowhere to go but fuck it. I was upset.

She comes into my room and says ""**EVERYTHING YOU OWN IS MINE I PAID FOR IT YOU CAN TAKE NOTHING GO WITH WHAT YOU'RE WEARING AND EVEN THAT IS MINE"".**

We fight, we struggle, she pulls my hair as I try to leave (her hands are weak but boy can she hit) 

*Once she had me on the floor in the corner and stepped on me as if I was a cockroach (but she says that never happened so idk guys maybe Im just crazy?)*  

Shes violently flailing at me and i push her off of me on the bed i dont want her touching me, I yell at her to get her hands off me.

Anyway, i manage to break free with this bag ive got and i get to the stairs and she says:

""IF you try to go I will push you down the stairs""

She threatens to fucking kill me right?

And I said ""no im leaving idc""

Mind you, she tells me to go but i am her primary carer (shes not severly disabled itll just take her more time to do things that I usually assist her with)  and the point is she doesnt WANT me to go because that'll be inconvient to her.

&amp;#x200B;

OH ALSO, she got offended once because I said when I leave and get married, she wont live in the same house as me and my husband? 

I mean? Obviously not?

Anyway the screaming match goes on for hours. 

Slut, whore, disgrace, dirty person, ungrateful, dishonest.

It doesn't end. 

I walked out of the house. andwithin minutes she calls me - i wasnt gonna answer, but I did. 

And she begged me to come back because its not safe (COVID is everywhere here too)

Anyway I did and we had another fight today over something completely menial.

Eventually im gonna move out, and I try my best to keep myself sane.

But I'm angry and hurt.

Idk why I wrote all this, I just felt the need to get it out.

The most recent instance, just now, I had my candle that I got for my 21st birthday on my TV stand. It's always propped up on a wooden coaster right next to my mug. When I was watching TV just now, I noticed the mug was on the coaster in place of where the candle would usually be. It didn't even fit on the coaster so it was just lopsided and completely out of place. I confronted my mom again and she sais she dropped it when she was in my room and didn't wanna drop it again so she put it in the hallway closet. 
It's always like walking on eggshells when I talk to her and I have no idea what to do anymore or how to even approach this. She makes me feel crazy when she says it wasn't her doing and I always end up frantically looking for these items, not realizing most of the time that she steals little things so that I don't notice until way later or don't even bother bringing it up. She also draws symbols on my pictures I have with friends. Is it unreasonable for me to feel mad about this? Because she guilts me when I get upset about it and I don't even know how to express my feelings now. Please help.

I’d (29F) been doing well recently in dealing/surviving with my awful family until today. I’ve found a volunteer activity that I love (gets me out of the house, I love the great people I volunteer with, it’s really helping with my terrible self-confidence) and I’m only a few months away from finally paying off my student loans (the payments were so much each month that I’ve had to live at home with my family while I pay them off so I can afford payments for my own place to live).

Then today was awful. I woke up and found out my younger brother had a sore throat/headache/cough/etc and so he was staying home from his job. He works at the same warehouse as my mom, is autistic (but is not very “high-functioning”) - so basically he stayed home because he tends to not deal with illness well and my mom just “didn’t want to deal with him” getting upset at work today (he gets frustrated that he can’t just take a magic pill or something to make a cold/back pain/whatever’s bothering him go away instantly and so he basically throws a fit like a little kid would). 

So this is just great news for me - while I’m fully vaccinated, my job is pretty strict on following CDC guidelines while we’re in the office. I was supposed to go in to the office today, so I had to text my boss this morning so she can confirm that no, I can’t come in to work today because we don’t know what my brother has. Best part is, my parents think Covid is just fake news or a plot by the government to control people. The fact that I just quit a second job not too long ago where I was working as an EMT for a private ambulance company and actually had Covid-positive people in my ambulance on my shifts? Nope, not even having a healthcare worker in their family who saw proof Covid exists can convince them Covid is real. Of course no one else in my family besides me is vaccinated… my brother with his disability doesn’t know any better than what my parents tell him so he’s been just as careless as my parents have during this whole pandemic. So he could very well have Covid… or he could just have a cold. 

I might never know what he’s sick with because my parents laughed at me when I suggested they see if he can get tested. Because he “doesn’t have Covid” because Covid isn’t real to them. They’ve been extra nasty with me all day today for daring to mention that he should get tested and for trying to explain how not knowing what he has puts my life in limbo. Can’t go in to work or do volunteer work if I might’ve been exposed to Covid, and dad just mocked me for it: “oh what’s the matter, can’t go out and volunteer? Inconveniencing your job? Wow that’s just too bad isn’t it? Oh boo hoo.”

I’ve been getting either the silent treatment or nasty comments thrown my way all day (you know how the anti-mask Covid-denying crowd is). I had to rearrange work things with my boss today because we’re in the middle of our busiest time of year, and now me being back to working from home everyday instead of in the office messes up the plan. I think my boss understands I can’t help my family being like this. I hope she’s not just saying that but actually thinking I’m a pain in the ass and holding this whole thing against me now. Can’t go in to the office for awhile now. All because my brother won’t get tested so I know what I’m dealing with. 

I’ve been trying not to worry about what if my brother does have Covid and I get sick from it even though I’m vaccinated. He was wandering around the house all day coughing on everything.

Worst of all though is how this whole situation is probably going to sideline me for awhile from the volunteer work I do. I’m on a search and rescue (SAR) team and I love it. It’s been the one bright light since I’ve been stuck living at home paying off student loans. The people on my team are wonderful… sane, caring, funny, smart, mentors to me in SAR and just in general as far as what it’s like to know older people who aren’t terrible people like my parents are. It’s done wonders for my awful self confidence (really, my self confidence dwells in the pits). I think they might actually like having me around on the team, which is huge for me to feel like I’m accepted/belong somewhere. And hell, I get to help people and maybe find a missing person at the same time which is freakin great!

But I’m not sure how I can go to meetings/trainings/actual searches for the next week or so knowing my brother could have Covid and I could get my team sick or the other area SAR teams that we search with sick. I have an annual fitness test in a few days that I have to pass to stay on the team and I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go now. My parents just couldn’t care less about what’s important to me (my whole life they never have) or how their actions (in this case thinking a global pandemic is a total joke) affect anyone else. Once again my parents ruin a good thing I enjoy doing. It really puts me in an awfully sad place knowing I probably shouldn’t do SAR for the next week or so, so that I don’t risk getting anyone sick. If they could’ve taken the pandemic seriously or would at least get my brother tested maybe I wouldn’t be in this position.

And what prompted me to post this now? We literally just had a SAR request come through for us to go look for a missing person and I had to make myself say no because I’m worried I could get them all sick with whatever my brother has. What if it is Covid - I don’t want getting my teammates sick on my conscience. So I’m sitting here feeling like I’m letting my team down and I’m also completely miserable because I can’t go out and help look for this missing person. All because my parents think Covid is a joke and refuse to take my brother to get tested for Covid. Just the worst way to end a real awful day and I feel terrible and furious.

Tonight Im probably going to cry a little more, hope Covid isn’t circulating in this house, and hope this missing person is found by the SAR folks that could go out.

Tomorrow I’m going to start asking people I know to recommend a realtor - see if I can start the condo buying process. And I’m going to call my doctors office and beg them to write me an order to be  tested for Covid (stupid HMO plan rules) or at least see if they can give me advice for how long I should avoid going out in public when someone in my house has a mystery illness. 

As much as this day is hurting, I’m not going to have much more like this because I’m determined to get out soon. I’m tired of paying the price for having them as my parents.

anyways, for years my mom has said how my dad is a N, and honestly as i get older i can sorta see it. but i will be honest, i love my dad and he has always been there for me, especially through my parents divorce. but now that i look back on it, i can see how my dad wanted me to potentially testify against my mom in court (which i can’t remember what it was now but it was probably about something i was mad at when i was younger). eventually, i grew older and i grew closer to my mom (especially during COVID). 

but almost a year ago, i just got my license and i’m a little new to the road, but my dad tried to get me to drive the highway after only about having my license for a couple of days. i said no and my dad gets into an argument about how i should just do it. eventually we stop and get gas, and i’ve calmed down so i suggested that i drive the rest of the way (not on the highway). he ends up sleeping in the back while i drive, and my sister and i swear that we saw him drinking some whiskey shooters in the back of the car. 

we eventually make it to our destination and he suggests we should go to a friends house that is currently being built. all of HIS friends are there and it’s just my sister and i. eventually one of my family friends comes and we were talking upstairs in the sun. my dad and his friend tried going up an unstable ladder when there was stairs 15 ft away. my dad climbed up the ladder with a drink in his hands. he made it almost to the top but then the ladder went out from under him. i was in shock and my family friend rushed to go help him. she ended up saving him but minutes later my dad forgets completely that he almost died and his daughters would have watched. i came to the conclusion that i was done with this situation and i felt that if i stayed i could potentially hurt my entire family, so my sister and i left with my family friend WILLINGLY.

my dad, maybe 30 mins later, notices were gone and demands we come back to him. we don’t but he calls the police saying we were kidnapped. the police come and we said we went willingly with my friend. my dad didn’t like that and tried to get us back. 

eventually my sister and i get back home and we are just shocked that this has happened. my dad called/texted us 24/7 for at least 1-2 weeks. 

now, a year later he denies this situation EVER happened and has avoided any sort of apologies that i feel i need to get better.  

now a year later, another situation has happened where we found out he was abusing drugs. he admitted doing drugs but i honestly think he only admitted it because his family was there. 

now a couple of months later he denies doing drugs and i feel like he’s lying about going to therapy.

I've only recently fully realized how wrong that was, and how traumatized I am by my upbringing. I've been emotionally and verbally abused by both of my parents since I was a child, in various different ways, including isolation. They refused to send us (me and my younger sibling) to school. The only friends I had were ones I would meet around town when I was allowed out to play. Even then I was always told that I focus too much on ""outside people"" and that I was always looking for validation from others when all I needed was them, something they still say to me now, even though I am an adult in my 20's. Adding a lack of close family, my parents not having friends, and being raised very religiously, created two kids who were very codependent on their parents, which is how they like it. The worst part is that it took me so long to realize all of this because of how loving they both are toward us. It made the fairytale of us being this perfect family seem very true and real to me for so long. They even used our so-called perfect life as a reason that my sibling and I shouldn't have any mental problems, which they would deny now if I mentioned it, but then again they would deny any of this has any merit, even though I know it does. Even now though, I am worried to move out, although I really want to.

(TW: sexual gross comments)
So I’ve kinda been wondering if my fathers behavior was sexual abuse even though I haven't been sexually touched to my memory by him. Not just that but some other family members making me feel uncomfy. So in general he's a creep and my mom excuses it by pretending that the fact he is this way preemptively protects his daughters from creeps. My mom says I should trust him when he says gross things about our outfits/bodies, because ""he is a man and he knows what they think about”. He would make sexual remarks about my mom and talk about her being naked for him. I hated it.he would insult my sisters weight and said he could see her pubic hair one time when she wore some shorts. One time when he heard me laughing he called my sister down and asked her if I was having an orgasm as a ""joke"". Another time when I was going through puberty he told my uncle to look at me and said “ my baby’s growing boobies”. *gags*. One time, which happened to be the last time I was having the time of my life playing in the rain was when I was 16 and he made us come in after 2 minutes because he didn’t want anyone looking at “his babies” in the rain. Another thing that’s always been weird is that he always tells me if someone rapes me he will kill him. Like he is just waiting for that scenario. My whole life, even as a kid. That’s what I remember from him. And then idk but my sister is always asking me if I remember the showers we took together as kids. One time I think she kissed me but I’m not really sure because I was young, younger than her. Anyways, this is a bit heavy, so if you read through this, thanks.

It all started when I got an email from my n-mom on Saturday. This is weird, because she never initiates contact, especially not over email (usually I call her and she talks endlessly about her life). The email says she wants to talk privately about something, and everyone is ok.  So, no one is dying, I guess that's good? She also wants to talk over FaceTime, which is weird considering she hates video calls. I have no idea what she wants to talk about, but my partner and I speculate: maybe my parents are divorcing, maybe their business failed, maybe it's some weird inheritance. My partner suggests it's her calling to tell me she hates them. I schedule the call for Saturday knowing I have an appointment with my therapist on Tuesday to unpack it all.

When I get on FaceTime with her, we exchange a few pleasantries, and then she says, ""I assume you know why I want to talk to you."" I respond that I do not know. Then she proceeds to tell me how she is shocked and appalled that my partner has been showing signs of being non-binary. I know that my partner has been recently becoming more comfortable sharing that they are non-binary online, including with a profile picture where they were wearing makeup. She says some things to indicate that she's seen this photo. She also talks about how my cousin's kid recently came out as non-binary and wants to become a woman. Her opinion is that being non-binary means that you don't know what you want and your desired partner will change day to day. She then suggests that, ""in my book, this is grounds for annulment."" She literally just told me to divorce my partner, whom I love, because she is afraid of them being non-binary. At this point, my mind is spinning - what have I gotten myself into? So many thoughts going through my mind, I try to keep my cool and defend my partner. I don't want her to have the satisfaction of getting a rise out of me. I also point out that I am on the non-binary spectrum, but because I was born female, that's somehow different to her. I asked her if I could provide some book recommendations to understand the difference between gender and sexuality, and her response was, ""I don't read. I don't want to understand.""

After several more derogatory statements about non-binary and trans folx, she then shifts the conversation towards how she thinks my partner is not caring enough. Apparently, (in her opinion) they are the reason I've switched jobs 3 times in the last year, the reason I don't talk to her or her siblings, and the reason that I seem ""so sad in the last few years."" They also don't hold the door enough for me. Apparently, before I met my partner, my parents and I were a close, happy family with no issues. Unfortunately, she forgot about the part where she forced me to go to the same school she went to, where she broke into my email in the middle of the night, where she and my e-dad would get drunk at the Mexican restaurant and talk about other people in the restaurant, where she freaked out that I didn't believe in the same religion as her (even though she never went to church herself). 

Throughout this whole conversation, she keeps switching between the topic at hand and doting on her cat (who obviously doesn't want to be held), as if it's no big deal. She also suggests that I was starting to ""get over"" my introversion before I met my partner, and that they made me backslide on that. Introversion is not something to ""get over"" - it's a part of me. She finished the call by adding in some racist complaints before we ended the call.

Fast forward one day, and I get a message from my cousin, who rarely initiates conversations with me. She starts by asking something pretty tame, then after I respond, asks if I will visit home and tries to guilt me about visiting my grandma, and also tries to pull my nostalgia heartstrings. I recognize her flying monkey tactics, and don't engage with this. I can only imagine the rumors circulating in my n-mom's family about how I apparently need an intervention to get away from my non-binary partner who has supposedly trapped me in a marriage.

Before all of this, I was under no illusion that my n-mom liked my partner, but this really sealed the deal. My therapist was really upset by this story as well.

To give you some backstory, she is a kleptomaniac, pathological liar, cheater and most importantly: a narcissist. She was in and out of jail for a few years of the beginning of my life, and when she “came back” she was nothing but neglectful and emotionally, mentally and sometimes physically abusive. I have never in my life experienced another person like her. She is beyond selfish and ignorant, and has only ever apologized for the things she’s done to me when she was drunk or needed something from me. To sum it up, she ruined so many parts of my life. It was about 3 weeks ago that something inside of me finally clicked where I was at my wits end, but actually this time. She is blocked on everything, I moved out and have no plans to ever reconcile. For the past 20 years all that she has proven is that she doesn’t want to change and she does not care who it hurts. In the last couple days she has texted my brother and my dad to ask them if I miss her or if I’ll call her. It’s crazy because since cutting her off, I genuinely feel much lighter and that I finally have freedom, but I want to tell her off so badly to the point where it’ll keep me up at night even though i know it will make zero difference. I know that I won’t do it most likely because not only would i still be unsatisfied but it will just feed her ego.

This sub (and my therapist) have helped me navigate a lot of things as an adult child of nparents but I still have no idea where to start with this post😅 

I (24F) have been LC with my enabling/covert nmum, ndad and gc/flying monkey brother since April this year. 

I went NC 2 years ago after moving out of home. They started a smear campaign amongst all my extended family literally the same night. If those relatives didnt bully me, they ignored me. Some to this day, still refuse to acknowledge my existence because of how I ""broke up the family"" and hurt my parents by moving out so suddenly. I was pressured by relatives into speaking to my parents again. 

Being back in contact for 6-ish months last year just reminded me why I left. My nparents have not changed, they are just on their best behaviour which is so much more sinister and a total mindfuck. The effects of the initial smear campaign still traumatizes me so I have just been LC until I have gathered enough strength to decide what to do next. Trial and error I suppose. 

My partner (29M) and I have been together since the same time I moved out, so sadly he was also dragged into the smear campaign and relatives accused him of ""stealing"" me away and ""influencing"" me. We have talked a lot about whether we want my side of the family involved in our lives much longer. He told me he plans to propose within the next few months and as excited as I am, I am also incredibly stressed because I know my family will try to exert their control and dominance over the entire thing. They wont be happy for me but they will absolutely wear the news like a badge to show off to everyone around them. 

They have overshadowed so many moments in my life, I dont want it to happen with this one. 

Deep down, I know going NC again with my parents will be in the cards - maybe the only card. I cant keep up LC long term. As much as I was in pain when I first went NC, I also had peace of mind like no other point in my life. I knew where I stood and so did everyone else, even if they were making a fuss about it. And just remembering how they acted when I moved out vs every other important milestone in my life (ranging from mockery, bullying, threats, sabotaging any plans i.e. my 21st birthday party and even when I was starting my bachelors to physical violence and intimidation), I cant help but feel like I need to prepare in advance for how/who I share our good news with when my partner proposes. 

I already knew at 11 years old I did not want my father walking me down the aisle and I cant see that conversation going down well. 

I already know I'll be hiring security/bouncers for the day and wont be inviting 3/4 of his family to the wedding when it happens which also wont go down well, but hopefully they know better than to still expect niceties from a niece they abandoned and ostracized when she was in need *eye roll* 

Is it worth having these conversations and confronting them when the time comes to draw the line? Do I wait for them to fuck up somehow so I can cut them off or do I just rip the bandaid off now, seemingly 'unprovoked' and risk the backlash way before it can possibly overshadow this next chapter in my life? Do I need to give them an explanation if I go NC?

Would appreciate your stories or suggestions♡ whether you are LC or NC.

My Nmom DURING THE FIRST MEET questioned them multiple times if they are ""shia"" which is a different sect of islam because if they are, I cant marry him. No matter how many times they said they aren't, and they are in fact just regular old muslims, my nmom insisted they must be non-muslims and this will never work out. 

I spent the entire day crying so hard because she said i cant marry him and was accusing him of being non muslim. When in REALITY, she just didn't want me to marry an Iraqi, she wanted me to marry a Palestinian. so during this ""first meeting"" which is supposed to be a big celebration for both families, i spent it crying. She also made several ""secret calls"" to his mom just harassing him and she ended up crying to him about it (his mom cried). 

&amp;#x200B;

The next step that she ruined was the engagement ring/gold necklace gift that is traditional to arabs. The man presents his wife with a ring of her choice and a beautiful Turkish gold necklace. Usually it is whatever he can afford. I hand picked a BEAUTIFUL topaz/diamond ring and a gold necklace, and he spent about 10k on the engagement party. My Mehr (which is like my islamic right) is also 10K. Which means he is going to give me TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS to marry me (which the father decides for the daughter and so on). 

So keep in mind, he is giving me, quite a lot of money. and paying for everything. 

When Nmom saw the ring/necklace, she looked at it in UTTER DISGUST, IN FRONT OF HIM, and tossed it aside and said shes DONE with my marriage and that 

""You could give her literally garbage, if its from someone she loves shell accept it"". As an insult. 

shes been ignoring me ever since and I have been having panic attacks, and crying.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, another major step in the marriage process is just filled with me crying because of HER. She thinks this is about HER. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I seperate myself emotionally from her reactions/opinions and just enjoy myself until my wedding? The wedding dress picking, the events upcoming, more is coming and I know she is not gonna stop until i am literally moved out. Everyone tells me that Im right and I did nothing wrong, but it doesnt stop me from crying and even FEELING GUILTY that i didnt just listen to her to avoid these reactions.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713352,public,self,Nmom is making every step of my marriage one of suffering,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p6iffu/nmom_is_making_every_step_of_my_marriage_one_of/,some_ads,7,advicequestionarticle,43e3b7aa-2a2b-11e3-a69c-12313b04c5c2,[Advice Request],,dark,,,,,,,,

I just moved back in with my parents a few months ago, as I just graduated college this year. I am currently working and studying for my MCAT to apply and hopefully matriculate to medical school in 2023. This means I have 2 years at home. I'm first gen, lower-middle class, and know no physicians or college grads in my family and I had to unlearn a lot of toxic behaviors (hyper-independence, unable to ask for help, lack of confidence, etc) caused by my narcissistic dad after living at college for 4 years. It was tough and made my first year at college an emotional and mental disaster. Living with my family has always been very tough growing up as I was always aware of my father's behavior and my parents relationship. My dad is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent. He is the one that mostly financially supports our family too (shelter and water/electric bills) and guilts us for it constantly. After moving back in after graduating I cannot seem to take it anymore. I find myself silently crying in my room until I have headaches. I feel so unhappy. I could never have a peaceful relationship with them even if I try and be kind. The only thing I can do is just ignore them which causes me more trouble with them. I struggled and supported myself financially all throughout college so that my dad couldn't hang over my head that he paid for my education, as he did my freshman year of college. He hangs over my head that he gives me a place to live too, he brings up things he's done for me in the past... like when I was a child. My parents are also very sexist and treated my sisters and I like adults when we were children. My brothers are pre-teen/teens and they don't do anything for themselves and my parents expect me to raise them as if I was their mother. They feel entitled to me. I grew up expected to be have parental responsibility for all my siblings since they are emotionally immature. I sent emails to my siblings teachers at age 8+. I have a sibling one year younger than me but she is no help and watches me face it and constantly leeches off of me. My parents treat me differently than my siblings and often say hurtful things out of anger. I work part-time and study part-time as well as volunteer on the weekends. On top of that, no one in this family has boundaries. Barging into rooms, never cleaning after themselves in the kitchen and bathroom, absolute filth.  At this point I am ranting but I just really feel so frustrated that I don't have the financial means to leave.

I had star charts in my room, and I wanted a telescope. 

Well, my parents got my GC brother a telescope for Christmas. And even though he truly didn't care about it, and he was more than happy to share, I wasn't allowed to use it at all. 

In college I took an astronomy course, and my father threw a fit that I was thinking about making it my major-- no jobs anyway, he said, a foolish impractical thing to study. He said that about every major, but he was particularly vocal about astronomy. Math was never my strong suite anyway so I didn't pursue astronomy. 

Three years ago, at Christmas, my GC little brother gave me a brand new telescope. Not an expensive one, he's not a well-off man, but the gesture cut me to the soul. I thanked him for remembering I like the stars, and he said yeah, of course. It was a gesture that meant a lot to me and seemed to be a gesture of kindness from him.

hey guys f/18 thought i would share my story :

so my whole life my mom was abusing me and always had narc traits, but i didn’t realize until i was about 13 because that’s when it got worse. 

I grew into my own individuality and rejected her idea of having the perfect image all the time and being a completely different person behind closed doors. 

I was beaten if i didn’t clean my bathroom to her standards and she would make me stay up until 12-1 am on school nights because I didn’t clean to her standards . often times she would threaten to kick me out of “her room” because of this. my room was never super trashy so i never understood this.

she beat me because i wore makeup to school. keep in mind i am now a whole makeup artist influencer with thousands of views and company collaborations. i’m sure she hates this secretly but would put on a front . whenever i did makeup at home she would basically shame me , scream and tell me i needed to find something better to do with my time.

she would be nice to me for weeks and then just get really angry and snap for no reason, hold grudges, etc.

my family knew about this and would simply tell me to stop getting mad.
CPS case after case , which were all closed because no one could even believe a WOMAN would put her hands on her own daughter. she lied every time and said i was “rebellious “ . 

when i was 17 she got jealous of the fact that i stayed out till 9 with my BOYFRIEND at the time that she supposedly liked so much, she argued with me the next day and got physically abusive and essentially fought me till i was bleeding from my mouth.

lived with my grandma, dormed at colleged , came back for summer vacation (i was now 18) , mother made a surprise appearance and fought me again. this time , with my bf on facetime. she argued with him and said every childish thing you could think of.

moved out to my bfs house after the police STILL tried to justify this as us having a scuffle, been here ever since.

family was stalking my social media from fake accounts and never reached out to talk to me. nobody knows where i am, nobody knows about my well-being. 
I guess it’s better that way.

my current bf never fails to make me feel loved and tells me daily how much of a beautiful person i am, inside and out.

to any person still stuck in this situation , i know its scary, but when you turn 18, it’s perfectly okay to run and not go back to the abuse. your mental health will thank you.",True,False,False,raisedbynarcissists,t5_2we9n,713344,public,self,2 months officially NC with my Nmom and her enabling family. ask me anything!!!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/p6hnjw/2_months_officially_nc_with_my_nmom_and_her/,some_ads,7,progressupdate,b0d07a64-82c9-11e3-9340-22000aa47206,[Progress],,,,,,,,,,

My high school years I didn't have the best relationship with her (lying and using drugs, not coming home on time, bad grades). I thought it got better but after years of anxiety and some depression probably, I realize just how much fear I have of some people and family, mostly mom. She used to curse at me, tell me I'm not doing something right, tell me my clothes don't match, my hair looks long. She once told me she didn't want me living here and threatened to kick me to the street because I stupidity drove home drunk in 11th grade. She wouldn't care if I'm here alive or dead, I'm dead to her anyways. 

 She one day barged in on me in the bathroom when I was half naked, kept it open and asked me some stupid question. When I told her can you leave!! She got mad at me for leaving the door unlocked! I feel like such a shit person too because all I've been doing the past 4 years of my life is being a delivery driver. I don't want to talk to her because I don't think it matters.  I have nothing to talk about. 

I get so hungry sometimes too. I don't want them to think I'm stoned and that's why I'm hungry. There's not much food in the house besides cereal, sometimes peanut butter jelly and bread. Sometimes leftovers. Dinner can be good but I feel like I'm not entitled to the food unless she's tells me there's food in the kitchen.

 I've never cooked real food while shes home and I'm scared to even xo that in fear of her being suspicious of me. I'm terrified of doing ANYTHING different because she'll get suspicious of me and think I'm up to something or high from weed. So I just wait until they're in their room, I hear them snoring, or they're just not in my presence.

I get so excited when nobody is home. I feel like I can breathe again, make noise again, live again. Otherwise I'm trapped in my room, while her and my stepfather who is there but has never acted like a father figure watch TV in the living room. 


No friends because I ghosted the group of them a few weeks ago. I feel like one day my mom is going to snap on me and there's nothing I can do. Nobody else to stay with. A dead end job. Barely any money. My car recently broke and cars are my biggest passion. I just wish I can live a normal fulfilling lifestyle. All i do is sit on my bed on my phone, borrow my brothers car sometimes to work a bit or go on a small hike and smoke by myself. That's all I do.

This is my first post here. I look at all of yours daily and relate to a lot of them. This subreddit helps me feel less alone. Thank you for sharing your experiences and helping others feel less alone in this world. My therapist suggested that I write this as a way to forgive my mother. Not for her sake, but for mine. I finally have the courage to make a post, although I’m not sure how confusing it may be for strangers, as it doesn’t explain a lot of what I’m referencing. Trigger warning *childhood sexual trauma*

Dear mom,
I don’t know where to begin with this letter. I wish I could really say these things to you and know that you will listen and actually care, actually take the time to admit some faults and choose to change yourself for the better. All my life I’ve loved you more than is probably healthy. I spent the better part of my childhood/adolescence worrying about you. I don’t remember a time in my life that you have ever been truly happy, and to this day, it hurts me a lot. I wish that you cared about your happiness in the same way that I care about it. From the time I can remember as a little kid, you were always so stressed out and upset, every day. A lot of how you felt rubbed off on me. I can remember growing up how I always would frantically clean the house before you got home, fluff the pillows on the couches, dump the ashtrays in the trash, wipe the coffee table, counters, and kitchen table off. Make sure sis and I’s room was clean. I remember thinking maybe if everything was “perfect” that it would somehow change your mood, because I knew how important having a clean house was to you. Now, I have to have a clean house in order to feel secure and comfortable.

Do you remember when I was 8 years old, and you found out that sis and I had ‘seen’ cousin B’s penis from Aunt M and dad? Do you know how scary it was when you came home and got angry with us, acted as if whatever we had gone through was just one more stress added to your plate? You didn’t even ask us if we were okay. You just said “well, I guess you’ll have to stay with your Aunt M tonight while I go to darts.” And then I said no, mommy, it will be okay. Cousin B won’t hurt us. and told you that we didn’t want to go to Aunt M or dads. And instead of being a reasonable adult, you listened to me, your child, the 8 year old who didn’t even know that what was happening to her was wrong? Did you know that because of that, I carried that with me for the rest of my life, thinking that it was my fault that you got in trouble with DHS the first time, and it was my fault that the family was never the same?

The day that littler sis’s dad called the police because of what she said about cousin B, I remember coming home from school to you frantically running around, packing our stuff up. You had always treated me like a little adult, but I feel that from this day forward I was never a child again. You didn’t tell me what littler sis said, but you told me enough. That we had to get out right now, that you didn’t have the money to get us out, but it wasn’t an option, that we were losing littler sis. I helped you pack our things as you fell apart. That wasn’t the first time I saw that, as several months before that you broke down to me about G leaving you for your best friend, who was like an aunt to sis, littler sis, and I. I worried about you. As an 8 year old child, I worried about you. So much. When we moved into the duplex and had to do supervised visits with G and T (ex best friend) to see littler sis, it hurt me too. I know it hurt you horribly, and I am so sorry that you had to go through that. But I was there too, I was with you. I felt not only your pain, but I felt my own. I felt the loss of two adults in my life who I did love. I felt the loss of my baby sister too.
In that time, I remember that grandma and grandpa had given me a disposable camera to take pictures with my friends. So, I took it to school and took pictures with my friends. Veering more towards 9/10 years old at that point. L and I had taken pictures of each other in some awkward, laying down pose in the tunnels in the playground at school. I don’t know how the camera ended up at L’s house, probably because her mom would babysit us a lot. Do you remember? You came home one day, mad at me. crying and yelling at me. you pulled out those pictures of us laying down in the tunnel and told me that you were disgusted with me. You said that we were trying to be “sexy”. You made fun of us, and told me how gross that was. In that same conversation, you pulled out pages from my diary. This part is still weird to me, because I remember you saying that I had given the pages to L and told her to hide them so that you wouldn’t see them. I don’t remember doing that, but at the same time, I don’t really remember writing the pages either. Anyway, in those pages, I had written that I hated you. I remember you focusing hard on that, making me feel guilty for writing such a thing. Saying that I was ungrateful and unkind and asking me how could I do such a thing. And I remember feeling like the worst kid ever. I felt ungrateful, unkind, and dirty.

During that time I also started having what I now know is PTSD. I couldn’t sleep at night. You dated a bit, but even when you weren’t dating, and nobody was there but you, I would lay awake hearing pornography sounds blaring like a loudspeaker in my ears. Cousin B made me watch porn. Sometimes he would put it on and sit me in his lap and touch me and kiss me like I was his girlfriend or something. And as a kid, I thought that the sounds were of women in pain. I didn’t understand sex. I thought when you were having sex that you were being hurt. You were always very loud when you had sex when I was growing up, but I know now that I don’t think I was always really hearing you, the sounds were in my head. I remember waking you up night after night after night. As a child, I didn’t know how to communicate to you what was happening to me. I would just cry and say I couldn’t sleep. You would be annoyed, get up, give me Benadryl, again and again, and tell me to go back to bed. I remember wanting so badly for you to just hold me and comfort me, but you never did. and I didn’t know how to ask you for it.

After getting littler sis back you were dating a guy for a while. I walked in on you and him having sex one night when I was having one of my episodes. You got angry and yelled at me to go back to my room, and don’t come in your room without knocking, which had never been a rule in our household before. The next day you asked me what was going on, why I wasn’t sleeping. I wish I could remember what my tiny voice said to you. All I know is that I must have kind of communicated what was wrong, but not well enough. You had the guy sleep in the living room for a couple of weeks and I did sleep better. I remember you mentioning taking me to see a counselor. And I was okay with that. I wanted the help. But then, after a couple of weeks, the guy was back in your bed. And when I tried to talk to you about it, you basically said “get over it, he’s my boyfriend, we’re going to sleep in the same bed.” At some point, I recognized that my “episodes” were so much of a bother to you, that I stopped even going to you for help. I just continued having horrible sleep because of these horrible symptoms. The sound of sex in my ears, which to me equated to pain. My heartrate up to intense levels, sweating, dizziness, to the point of feeling like I might throw up. Horrible anxiety. Feeling extremely frightened. Not sleeping even effected my school life. I had always been a straight A student, and during my 5th grade year when we were going through this, I started “daydreaming” the teachers would call it. My grades started slipping because I stopped paying attention. I would say it’s really the furthest thing from day dreaming. It was more like awake nightmares.

Once we moved to the house, the next thing that I remember vividly is that I was laying on the couch watching TV, and I put my hand in my pants. I know now that that wouldn’t be socially acceptable to do while laying on the couch with people around, but I was a kid. And instead of asking me to do that in private, you snapped on me. you told me that I was disgusting and said to not do that. You made me get up and wash my hands. In that moment, you made me feel like I was dirty. AGAIN. As a CHILD. The PTSD symptoms continued throughout all of my teenage years when living with you, though only when you had a man sleeping in your room. I used the tv to distract myself, but you and your mother were against the TV being on for more than the set hour at bedtime. If I got caught turning it back on, I would get in trouble. Once I got a cell phone, I would then use that to distract myself by getting on social media or texting people. Before too long, you caught on to that too, and would take my phone at night. Now I realize that both the tv not being on and not using my cell phone are reasonable things for a parent to do with a typical child. But I wasn’t typical. I had mental health issues that were being denied all over the place.

Do you remember when I was 12/13ish, and sis and I got into a fight, and she said that she hated me? My reaction as a CHILD was to go to the bathroom and to try to take as many Ibuprofen as I could swallow. Sis followed me to the bathroom and started freaking out. You came in, and your reaction, AS USUAL was to get angry with me. you yelled at me and said I was being attention seeking, and to never do that shit again. You shamed me, then sent me to bed. No concern came from you. You didn’t think, wow, my kid has got some problems, maybe I should get her some help??? When I was 13 you had your “sex talk” with me which basically was you saying that as a teenager, my having sex was inevitable because that’s what teenagers do, and that you didn’t want me to get pregnant, so when I was in a relationship that I would need to be on birth control. So when I was 14, and with A, you took me to get the DEPO shot.

After being with A for several months, he was pressuring me to have sex with him. I remember feeling like I didn’t really want to, because I didn’t really like the way it made me feel, it brought back my PTSD issues. I tried to talk to you again about what happened to me. I told you that I needed your help. Your reaction was to say “I don’t want to hear this” and to walk away from me. I really needed you there, mom. I needed you to tell me that if I wasn’t ready, if I needed to see a counselor first to be sure that I knew what I was getting into, but you didn’t. you chose to avoid my truth for your own benefit. And so I did have sex with A. No, it wasn’t painful, but it wasn’t enjoyable either. I didn’t necessarily want to, it didn’t “feel good”. I did it because I thought that was just what you’re supposed to do when you’re in a relationship with someone. I thought that the feelings I was having about myself and the sexual encounters were just “normal” girl feelings. And I carried that same expectation about sex through every relationship that I had after that until I got with my current boyfriend and started going to therapy.

When I was 18, and cousin B sent me a message saying that he was in love with me and had always been in love with me, after also apologizing for what he did to me so many times over Facebook message, I felt really freaked out and also had a feeling of “she’ll finally have to believe me”… and you did, finally believe me. you took it into your own hands, made it about you. You messaged cousin B and stirred shit up in the family, which a part of me felt relieved about because you finally believed me. but then another part of me felt and still feels that you made it all about yourself. You finally helped find me a counselor, who ended up damaging the way I viewed reaching out for help for a long time. And when I decided to stop going, you were more than happy with my decision. When I got on medication for my mental health, you guilted me into stopping taking it even though I felt that it was helping me. You said that you didn’t like the person that it was making me. and I listened, because I cared about how I made you feel. You told me that if I reported cousin B that you wouldn’t forgive me, because he’s our family and that it would tear our family apart. I’m not saying I ever would have wanted to, but the fact that you couldn’t even support me, your own child, because in your eyes our so called “family” is more important than what I had been through, that is just really messed up.

You pushed me to make things right with him a few years later, and so I did show up to a couple of things that him and his wife were at when they came to town to appease you and other family members, even though it made me uncomfortable. You didn’t care about how uncomfortable it made me. when sis was uncomfortable about doing a family picture one of the last times that he came to town, I shouldered the blame for that because I knew that she needed what I always needed from you. Protection, someone safe to trust, someone who wouldn’t blab her feelings to every family member that she saw. And I know that to this day you and your sisters judge me for that, even though it wasn’t for me, it was for my sister, and I would do it AGAIN and AGAIN, no matter what, because I would stand by her no matter what she chose to do about what happened to her. THAT is what family does. Not lie and deny and avoid because it makes others more comfortable.

Since I’ve started therapy, my life has improved so much. It’s been a slow and steady improvement that I am really proud of, even if I still have my major moments of doubt about myself and what I am doing. I wish that you could be proud of me. I wish that you could see where I started, and where I’ve gotten, but it feels like all that you can see is that I’m harder to manipulate and that is too difficult for you. For all the times that you yelled at me for being depressed and belittled me for having feelings that I couldn’t explain or control, fuck you, mom. For all of the times that I needed you to be there for me, but instead you were cold, indifferent, and pushed me away, FUCK YOU! For all of the times that I let my depression take over and you called me lazy, fuck you. For all of the moments that I admitted that I was sick, that I wanted to die, and you didn’t do anything to help me, FUCK YOU. Fuck you for not believing me when I knew that there was something wrong. Fuck you for saying that I’m attention seeking, or that I’m selfish. All I ever cared about was everyone else’s feelings. You made me think that there was just something wrong with me. and because of that, I dated and sought out friendships with people who also didn’t really like me for me. but I thought that it was normal, because of course, if someone didn’t really like me, or thought I was “too much, too sensitive, overly emotional” it was reasonable. I’d been told that my whole life. I really believed, I MUST be the problem, there’s no way that it’s anyone else’s fault. And then you would make me feel even more stupid for choosing to be around people who treated me that way, not recognizing where I learned to deal with that sort of behavior.

You always make my feelings about yourself, why? When I was sad as a kid or teenager, and couldn’t explain EXACTLY what was wrong you would literally YELL at me and ask why you’re so horrible. The last time that I tried to reach out to you will be the last time that I ever do. When I have a baby, I don’t want you to be there. When I go through a loss, you would be the last person I would call. When my heart is broken, or I need a place to live, I won’t reach out to you. When I graduate with my degrees, I don’t want you there. You couldn’t support me when I needed you to, and you always make my successes about yourself, as if any part of how you raised me is why I am the way that I am today. And it’s not. I’m who I am because of what you and others have put me through in my life, not because of how good of a mother that you are. I was raped by a guy that I really liked, but I couldn’t even tell you. Not only because of how you had always responded to me in the past, but also so as not to confirm you racial hatred. He was the only black man I ever tried to date, and I didn’t want you to be “right” about your horrible nasty racist beliefs. When my best friend died and I had nowhere to go, you charged me RENT! You told me after a couple of months that “it’s been long enough, you need to get over it already.” !!!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU! Why can’t you have an ounce of empathy for anyone outside of yourself? How could you hurt me so much? I’m your flesh and blood, your daughter! How is choosing denial better than choosing to be close to me? how is avoidance the answer to everything in your life? 

I know now that you will never be the mom that I thought you could be, because you choose yourself above all else, and I’m sorry for that.
I’m sorry that you won’t get to know the amazing woman that I am choosing and working to become. I deserved better, even if you gave your “best”, and both of those things can coexist; you’re just not emotionally mature enough to understand that. I’m sorry that you had a hard life, but that does not discount the fact that I have too. Not everything is about you. I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the daughter that you want me to be, just as much as you’ll never be the mother that I want and need you to be. You’re welcome for being there for you when I was too young to understand that it wasn’t my job. I know you think that I am abandoning you because I stopped being there for you at a certain point. And I’m sorry for that too. Because of you, I know how emotional abandonment feels, and it hurts like a motherfucker. Nobody deserves to feel that way. But no child should be responsible for their parents pain. Thank you for working your ass off to provide for me and making sure that I didn’t turn out to be a fuck up. I know that you tried, I just wish that you could try harder now to heal us.
I love you mom, please know that. I’ll never stop loving you and wishing that we could have a better relationship. But I’ll never be naïve enough to believe that it can happen. They say time heals everything, but I don’t know if there is healing from this sort of pain. I hope that I can forgive you for my own well being, but I’ll say that it may be the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do.

Dearest \[Name\],

Unbelievably, it is now almost one year since you left.  I realize that you wouldn’t have had this time away from us unless you felt it was the healthiest thing for you to do, however I miss you terribly and hope there is a way to heal the distance. This dreadful pandemic is stretching on for longer than we all expected and disrupting so much in our lives. I was clearing out some old files the other day and came across a photo of you with \[family members\] and me with everyone looking so happy standing outside an old hotel (New Forest perhaps?). It brought me to tears –  memories of a happier time.

Dad’s health issues seem to be worsening. The doctor has upped his blood pressure meds to max strength and he takes readings twice a day. Of course his volatile outbursts are not at all helpful in managing blood pressure. Things haven’t changed since you left – prolonged periodic rants continue (which can extend for 2+ hours and are not good for his or my health). My strong intuition is that this was a big part of the reason you left. I suspect there were also things that I did or didn’t do that have been hurtful to you and made you feel that distance was a wiser choice.

Would you consider writing back to me and letting me know more of your thoughts and feelings? I promise to be non judgmental and read what’s written purely as informative and not seek to defend myself.

Also, if you are struggling financially I am happy to transfer cash to you no questions asked – just ask.

I was just thinking, Could a sheltered child or one that comes from a relative who gives them a life where they are unsure what to do half the time, give off symptoms similar? I knew someone who was diagnosed with Aspergers but had a horrible home life where they were sheltered, couldn't go on dates often or had to be watched so often and stay at home, except maybe sports, but are much better now even though they are still at home.

Basically, this person gets yelled at for....damned if you do something, damned if you don't. They could get along with people fine but the n-parent did not want this at all. They had a social life but it was 'off' so the parent decided to get them tested and claimed they were horrible on tests and hated specific fabrics and certain lights and all of this. And it was untrue. And now they are marked with 'Aspergers' for life even though it is mainly on school records even now when it's been a few years since graduation. I'm not even sure if the n-parent wants them on disability or not, but I know it is coming. 

I believe that 'Aspergers-like' symptoms since toddler days are due to the n-parent. It messed with the brain somehow on learning about the world around them. They are a beautiful person once they are away from the n-parent. They don't have Aspergers or anything autistic, it's just horrible n-parenting. They have a great social life, they can get a job, there is nothing stopping them from accomplishing their dreams. But the n-parent holds them back and wants them as 'disabled' as possible. Though real Aspergers people can just as well be beautiful in the world as well and function like everyone else, but I hope all of you get what I mean.

Arrogant, ill-mannered, opinionated, bumptious, selfish, immature people who ""would have liked to"" but never *could*.

And then... there I am. I have serious problems with having proper posture at the dinner table, keeping my elbows down, looking people in the eyes when they talk. I keep hearing my mother tell me how mediocre I am, I can't figure out how to properly relate to his family at dinner because I have never had dinner with both of my parents at the table, and certainly not conversing (at most we argue with the TV on at a crazy volume). I can't say anything about my family, because any smallest hint of what they are really like is met with horror by them. No, my parents did not want any more children. No, my parents are not capable of caring for animals. No, my parents don't go on vacations, they never paid me anything, they don't.... they don't *parent* at all.

These are not things I can say, these are not things I *want* to say, but I think it's written all over my face. I definitely hear these things constantly ringing in my head as I realize how my fiancé and I come from completely different worlds. He and his parents **talk**. His parents actively **encourage** him. His parents are **interested** in his life. His parents act like parents should act, and I feel so much like a fish out of water.

It was far too personal and hurtful for me to believe anyone else could have sent it. I also just went NC with her a little over a month ago and she's been very antagonistic since. She's been trashing me to other family members, trying to call my boyfriend while he's at work to complain I've blocked her number, and twice I've come home to her sitting in her car in front my house.

So, for background - last year when I was 25 my dad (divorced from my mom for the past 20+ years) passed away from covid and left me his house. I moved into it at the end of 2020 and still live there now. My mom has not been coping well with my dad's death and has been very unkind and unsympathetic since he passed. I've been withdrawing from her over the past year as a result, which has been making her push at my boundaries more and that's why I recently had to go NC.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Dear Natalie,  
&gt;  
&gt;Please try to keep the front of your property a little more presentable - it is an eyesore and the block is sure that your father would want it that way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stay safe,  
(My Neighborhood) Property Association

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck? Really what the fuck. WHO SENDS THAT TO SOMEONE?! There is no way to read this and not feel that whoever wrote it wanted to personally hurt my feelings. Why even MENTION my dad? No reason other than to make this as low a blow as possible. Why call my yard ""an eyesore"" instead of citing a fucking community guideline about yard maitnence? 

I found the phone number for the HOA and left them a message to confirm they didn't send it, but they haven't called me back. I know HOAs have rightfully earned their bad reputations but I just really don't believe they did this. First off, they're called the *(My Neighborhood) Property* ***Owner's*** *Association* not the *(My Neighborhood) Property Association*. You'd at least think they'd get their own name right when signing a letter they sent!! And while it's not unheard of for people in my neighborhood to send letters ""from the HOA"" to their neighbors about petty shit (the older people around here like to get wild sometimes) I just cannot imagine WHO out of my neighbors would send me something so personal and hurtful. 

I'm not saying I wouldn't put it past a neighbor to send a letter to someone and pretend its from the HOA to avoid confrontation but like... this letter is TOO PERSONAL for a fucking random neighbor to send me. This letter was typed up with the only intent being to cause upset. If I had a neighbor that was really so pressed about my front yard you'd think they would at least include the names of one or two landscaping companies. I don't really talk to people on my street, I'm not rude but I'm not going out of my way to be friendly. Who could possibly have so much beef with me after waving hello to each other every few weeks for the past eight months?! I just cannot bring myself to believe someone who is nearly a stranger to me would send me something like that. Why would this be anyone's first response to weeds????

Also, the letter was addressed to me directly with no return address and whoever had sent it went through the trouble of typing my name &amp; address up on a separate piece of computer paper, printing it, cutting it out and using clear tape to attach it to the envelope to avoid handwriting anything. I definitely wouldn't recognize the handwriting of anyone who lives near me but I'm sure I could recognize my mom's.

I'm just so upset. Every day I think about it I get even more angry. I keep thinking about what my mom intended for me to feel when getting that letter. Because if her plan worked correctly then I would think the way my house looked was something people on the block were talking a lot about, complaining about, to each other and at community meetings. I would think that the everyone in the community that's part of the HOA talked about me and my house at a meeting and decided to send me a really cruel letter. That would make anyone feel alienated and alone and ashamed and hurt. And I really did feel this way when I first read it. That's really how my mom decided I deserved to feel because I haven't been talking to her. 

I've just had one of the worst years of my life, I'm adjusting to so many new things its making my head spin and I'm still grieving the loss of my dad. Why be so unbelievably cruel to your only kid?

Family member threatened violence over stupid argument 🙄 My mom assured me the narc will -never- be around me again. I feel elated.

I'll try to keep this brief but with a small amount of background info: About two years ago I made it known I go by my name (not my birthname). Had some struggles with immediate family over it but the dust settled and they only slip up every now and then. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and my family is getting together to finally celebrate my sibling getting a GED and my dad getting a Master's (couldn't happen before because pandemic). Unfortunately, without me knowing until 5 f*cking minutes beforehand, my mom's sister was invited. I decided to stay for the family I supported.. 
I knew that was a mistake but the first hour seemed okay. Until we're all outside, chillin', having a good time. And then my mom's sister basically corners me, starts conversations I don't want (when are you having kids, when are you getting a new job, etc) and deadnames me several times. I correct her for the last time and she goes on a tangent about respect. I froze and didn't respond because I knew it would just make things worse but my partner had had enough and basically tells her if she wants respect she needs to give it. Oooooohh boooy did she not like that. Entire argument ensues (mostly her throwing slurs and being absolutely ridiculous). 
In the end, she was asked to leave and when she *finally* leaves, my parents reassure me this was her last chance and I'll never see her again unwillingly. 
I feel betrayed my parents invited her without me having prior knowledge but also absolutely giddy that my parents finally understand that she's just a terrible person and will *never* change.

I've been raised as a single child by my NMom together with her equally narcissistic sister, my aunt. Their favorite weapon of choice is the silent treatment, where they would go weeks without speaking to me at most was a year or so. It even went to a point where they installed a doorbell in my room and just ring me down for dinner because they refused to speak to me. Anything could trigger this, could be me being loud in the mall, or me not getting good grades. I honestly don't know and for fear of triggering this, I would mostly just spend my time in my room playing RPG's and avoiding a social life.

They are Chinese, so they often talk in that language knowing full well that I can't understand, but I understand enough that most of the time, they just talk crap behind other people or myself reveling in any bad news befallen to other people.

Because of this, I would often have intense bouts of rage and I overcompensated with having a bombastic, inflated personality where I needed to be heard and recognized outside my home. Outside at school, I was an extroverted, social person, but indoors I was a recluse in my own home. I sought validation and emotional support from anywhere I could get. It wasn't long till I found myself getting that attention from my juvenile bros, joining a gang, and generally fucking up my life by not going to classes and playing DotA in net cafes.  In those places, I actually was somebody, they knew me, and they listened. 

One night, I lost it one night because my mom refused to give me an allowance because she said I was going to use it to do drugs (I wasn't). It particularly bothered me because that night was one night where I legitimately wanted to go out with another group who invented me to a study session. I begged and pleaded for just enough for fare and a coffee or something. She wouldn't and I couldn't understand why. I tried reasoning with them, saying I'll be back by 9pm. They just ignored me, watched their TV and talked in Chinese like they usually do. 

In a few seconds, all of the days spent questioning my reality, having no-one to talk to,  having my self-esteem stomped, always being blamed as a bad kid, them not having any accountability for their lack of emotional maturity, just went rushing through my head all at once and I blacked out. I started destroying the house, breaking glass threw their TV on the ground. I had it with them acknowledging my existence. I was going to be heard one way or another whether it was through violence or not.

Eventually, the police came and had to sort it out. My mom legitimately wanted me arrested and typical gas-lighting, refused to take any accountability, and blamed it all on me and how I was a bad, bad person. She spent all her days following talking to all of my relatives about how much of a punk I was. That act of violence was the perfect evidence on how I lacked respect, and that she was the victim mother of a terrible child.  I didn't care anymore, I left soon after when I was 18. 

A lot of stuffed happened in between, eventually, my Nmom and Naunt couldn't stand each other and they both left and weren't speaking anymore. It took me years to reconcile my emotions, mostly with the help of my now fiance who spent many, many years untangling the sheer fucked interweb of my psyche.  Because of her, I managed to somehow salvage any semblance of a relationship with me and my Nmom and Naunt and now I can talk to them civilly, and not go into a burst of rage every time. I have a stable job, good relationships, am out of trouble, and am generally a contributing member of society. 

I'm 29 now, we're going to be married soon. My fiance insists that they are still my parents and that they need to be in my wedding, despite my earnest objections. I've done my best pleasing them and making sure my mom is included. I still maintain my boundaries.

Now, fast-forward to today, there is a legitimate threat looming once again. After a point of conflict with my mother, asking her to do something for me (reach out to somebody I'd be taking as a sponsor for my wedding) she told me to do it myself. I said if you can do this as a favor for me as you are more acquainted, I would be very grateful. I told her that I wanted her emotional support for this as I am really overwhelmed with all these preparations. She still tells me to do it myself, and its not her problem. Now she is ignoring my calls and messages.

This is bringing up some very bad memories and emotions from my past. I want to move forward but knowing her vindictive persona, there is legitimately a chance where she will to turn up for the wedding and or talk shit to my guests and bad-mouth me behind me back. I'm not quite sure what tod do now. I want to be a better person, but part of me just wants her gone from my life forever, but I still need her presence for my wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR - Nmom giving me the silent treatment like how she used to do when I was a child. Same kind of treatment that made me go crazy. Now it's all coming back at a very important time of my life (my wedding) and can seriously mess things up. I need to know what to do.**

I've read a lot of posts about confronting abusive and narcissistic parents on here so I tried to use a lot of tips. I kept it short and sweet, via WhatsApp so I can see she's read it, full of only truth and plenty of ballsy punch. 

I tried to expect all the possible outcomes with full awareness that the way she would respond would most likely be what I least expected, and boy was I right. She responded by thanking me for airing my grievances, and then in some weird wording (very unlike her) she went on to say how she doesn't 'begrudge' me for the anger I've had 'festering' inside me for so long. But that wasn't the creepiest part. She then went on to say that she would always be there for me when I need her, and ended it with a 'love you xx mummy'.

I swear to god, I almost passed out from disgust. Within that moment all of the I conflict inside my head that I previous had went away. The main reason I was conflicted when it came to my mother is half the time she was severely physically emotionally and verbally abusive, having had put me in the hospital once as a direct result of her physical wrath and later again due to sheer negligence (the doctors were surprised I wasn't dead that time). The other half of the time she was the absolute best mother you could possibly imagine. Loving, affectionate, the whole shabang. That's what fucked me up the most about her, because I never knew which mom I was gonna get, but I knew the one I wanted existed.

Anyway, I guess it made me realise that anyone that can respond that way is a full blown weirdo, and the affection was probably just a manipulation, or a way for her to get her 'fix' of love, possibly another way to feel powerful so that we rely on her or she can always have us in her lives. I actually recognise that that affection was false, all a ruse. It was absolutely the grossest thing to read, but she fell right into the trap, and I finally saw her for exactly who she really is. I finally feel free.

I’ve dissected enough of my childhood to give him that label, but as a child I never knew what to call it. I know now his abuse was “covert narcissism”, and it’s been difficult to accept as I thought I had a loving, normal relationship with him. Well, for the most part. You all know very well how we’ve been taught to make excuses for our abusers and not hold them accountable for the sake of “family”. Now onto the issue at hand… Over a year ago, I learned a disturbing story about my father. The story was actually conveyed to me by my husband and it’s caused a lot of conflict with everyone all around. It also set me back a lot with my healing…. Here’s what happened:

My husband had drinks with my dad one night, as at one point they got along (sort of) and my dad basically admitted to being what I would say is a pedophile. The disturbing part is that he said he was asking my dad advice on raising a daughter, and my dad told him that years ago when my sister was 5 or 6 (this would be his step daughter at the time when he was married to my mom and when I was still a baby; she and I have the same mom but different dads. She is 28 now), my sister crawled in his bed while my mom was in the shower, and started “exploring herself” (we never got a straight forward explanation as to what she did exactly) right next to him and he didn’t stop her. His explanation was that he was allowing her to be comfortable with her body and didn’t want to shame her, and this “made him feel fatherly and that he was protecting her innocence” by not stopping her. Obviously my husband was in a state of shock and made an excuse to go home, and after informing me, my husband called my mom and told her what he just found out and she had it out with him over the phone- he then made it even worse for himself by admitting that it was “hard for him to control himself when Caity (my sister) would walk around in her underwear all the time as a kid”. 

Since then my husband and I decided that he would never be around our daughter under any circumstances. I have connected dots and had realizations about my own childhood that have deeply disturbed me and made me question who I thought my father to be. I don’t remember any sexual abuse at all, but I do recall a few things that I now realize weren’t normal… I remember comments my dad made about my body as I was growing up, I remember him not taking me serious when I talked about men making me uncomfortable, I remember him taking pictures of women in public without their consent, I remember him offering me foot or leg massages to soothe “growing pains”, I remember him sharing sexual encounters with me with women from his past, I remember him watching porn on the family tv late at night without knowing I was aware of it… I remember feeling weird about these things growing up but I never brought them up because I thought it was normal, I just brushed it all off because he was my dad- and now I’m struggling with feelings of disgust and confusion with a man that I still somehow feel love for. 

He is in town and asked me to dinner with him and my brother, and for some fucked up reason I want to see him because it’s been a long time since I saw him last (he lives in another state). My husband told me he wouldn’t keep me from him but when I asked him about meeting with my dad and leaving my daughter home with him after he got off work, he said “I can’t control what you do but I don’t even know why you’d want to see him. I would feel hurt if you went”. 

I am not mad at my husband by any means and I don’t feel comfortable with my daughter being around my dad at all, but I am having trouble feeling love for and having good memories of someone that has exhibited and admitted to creepy, sexual tendencies with a child.

I am also not allowed to have a bank account or anything like that, so my options of getting away are very limited, so I try my best to lay low.

My parents promised they would build my sister a tinyhome on the edge of their property as a high  school graduation present 6 years ago, but my ndad is too busy taking the golden child to they gym to fufill his promise. My mom then let said older sister get a dog right at the same time she was allowed to get a job. I was automatically the built in dog sitter, as I was attending university online (the only way my parents would let me) and because of that I was always at the house.

Here is where things get interesting. I thought I would be allowed to get a job once I graduate, as that had a always been the agreement, but, since my sister I working and still doesn't have her house, and my mom is always over at grandma's watching tv, I have been stuck with babysitting the dog all day, but this time I don't have anything like school to keep my brain from melting away. My mom said she was going to pay me $100 a week (from my sister's money because my mom controls all of the money in the household) for watching the dog, but she hasn't. So here I am, sitting at home alone all day with nothing to do except feel my brain slowly rot as I am not even allowed to leave the living room as that is the only room the dog is allowed in. 

My ndad came home, asked my sister what she did today, and she told him about work. ""well you get a point,"" he said before asking me the same question. I had to tell him that, like usual, I had to watch the dog, and he said ""Sounds like a pretty cushy job.""

I couldn't say anything back. On one had yeah, he is an easy dog, but he would never believe me if I told him I felt like my mind and my grip on reality were melting away because, after two years of staying at home all the time for school, I thought I was going to be able to get out of the house and have a social life all for that to go down the drain for a dog.

Why can’t I remember any fucking thing? I barely remember my time living with grandma and grandpa, I’ve spent most of my life there and there’s nothing but faint memories. I fucking hate It. Why am I so angry and hate people talking to me? It’s because of grandpa beating the living dog shut out of me and screaming at me for any fucking thing. And it was just the children of my mother. My younger cousin got treated like he was royalty, and he still is. He too is autistic so idk if he understands how blessed he is and I won’t hold that against him. When I got diagnosed with Autism, my grandfather mocking me gotten worse, he’s said my brain is fried up like fish and pull my hair and said how my hair twisted up looks ugly (he is half Korean and had very wavy hair), whenever I was clearly sick he’d tell me to shut up and lock me in the dark in my room, when I was younger I would occasionally piss the bed, I had to get out and tell my grandma. In order to stop me from doing that my grandpa got a rope and tied my ankle to the head of the bead. That’s not even the worse of it, he’s let my siblings and uncle do some terrible things to me, not even my grandma would stop them. CPS was contacted twice, once through my mom and the other when I written a letter to my substitute teacher in third grade. When my family lied to that dumbass agent who clearly didn’t like me, they told me that if I told my feelings I’d never see any of them again. My brother told me “feelings are for white people” and to suck it all up. I don’t understand, so much more happened throughout my childhood why don’t I remember. I remember some things so vividly but other memories are so faint. I always assumed it was because I was darker compared to everyone else in my family. 

2. What does sibling love even feel like? My brothers hate me and just as much as I hate them. They’re both against me and it’s just me, the middle child and only girl in this fucked up family with my problems always being invalidated. Since everyone had a worse childhood than me. Maybe they’re right idk. Maybe I should act like I don’t have any problems in life. Oh wait I’ve been doing that all my life an and now I have everyone deep down. Damn I wish I had a job I’m tired of family. 

3. I tell myself bad things about my dad so I can stop expecting good things out of him. I know, I know I tried my very best not to fit into that average black kid stereotype but tough shit for me I fit in perfectly with it. The next generation of baby mamas with every daddy issue out there. I don’t see myself with my ideal future. I probably said this before but I blame my dad for everything that went wrong in my life so to hell with him :). Does he try? Probably not probably whenever I call him he gives me every excuse in the book just to shut me up for the next couple of months. He broke mamas heart, she soon found out she had MS soon after and became suicidal. He left her like this and pretended not to notice. Honestly half of my family is telling me to have nothing to do with him and the other half is to have a relationship. I’m torn between the two because I don’t want to fill the stereotype of the average black kid not having a dad. On the other hand I don’t want to end up like my older brother , heart broken, cold, angry and disappointed. Damn that lying man. Every time we call it’s a whole new “promise” saying “I’ll send you money” or “I’ll come visit you” mf can’t even come see me in person, he sent Stephon (my half brother) or his wife and daughter to do it. I hate my fucking life and I feel like having a relationship with both my parents would make it right. I feel like that’s how I would’ve had a normal life and I feel like I’ll forever blame my dad for all my problems no matter what he says or do. You know what who cares. He has his own family, grown ass children that he relies on to take care of me including his own wife, so let me not. I’ve always been a burden to everyone throughout my life so why not make it easier for some people. Asswipe of a father. Why have kids if you not gonna take care of them, mans was living a double life. TWICE. 

4. * I want to form a good relationship with my stepdad but even though he’s known me more than I ever known he was my stepdad he’s always been a stranger to me, he’s just…been there. I recall when I was younger I always wanted him to pick me up from school. I’m glad he knew his place though and never decided to lay hands on someone else’s child but that’s odd to me. No I don’t want him to beat me but does he even consider me family? Not just family but family family and not just another mouth he feels the need to feed? What is there to even talk about between us? To him I’m just that American kid that lacks “common sense” and I think that’s all I’ll ever be in the eyes of a man. A vulnerable girl that doesn’t think and can only be used for working around the house. Anyways THE CULTURE BARRIER IS MAD ANNOYING. 
*Let me just describe him in my viewpoint 
He’s a pathetic but smart man. Whenever he’s in the wrong he finds a way to pin it on someone else, he’s a pathetic child that throws a tantrum when things don’t go his way, and he get overly aggressive when someone says otherwise with him, honestly bro why are you yelling I’m right here trying to have a decent conversation with you. JUST BECAUSE IM ONLY 15 DOESNT MEAN I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING. Hell, one time I told him children don’t fix marriages and he told me to shut up I don’t know anything about relationships.

It's hard for me now even seeing those around me close to their mothers. My breaking point in life was when she went above and beyond to try and manipulate me to hate my dad. My parents were having relationship issues (due to her of course) that she was trying to spin the fault on my dad as to why they were headed to divorce, well come to find out she was having an affair and I caught her. I was 26 t the time this all happened but still was hard to watch my parents divorce...I was there by my dads side as she did everything she could to hurt him and myself. I have a husband and two small kids that I also protect from her. She constantly pleads and begs online to people how she misses them and texts me periodically wanting to ""mend"" our relationship.

It's days like today where I am in a career field I hate that I am slowly working to get out of that I have anxiety and resentment towards her.

- Nfather, due to being a narcissist, won't teach others, because any mistake they make is inexcusable and a headache to him.

- Nfather is overloaded with tasks, complains he's the only one who does anything and the only one who isn't stupid or lazy.

- Saying anything against that point (""well I do XYZ and you don't know how to do ABC"") will cause him to throw a tantrum about all the things he does for the house. As a result, no one says anything, knowing how it will end, so he thinks he's always in the right.

- And every time someone makes a mistake, no matter HOW tiny or inconsequential, he'll angrily point it out and start yelling. But he's given all the excuses and chances for his own mistakes, because of course, he's competent and unlike us, his mistakes don't define him.

So the background. My sister Elisabeth and her best friend from school went to two different but close universities. Her friend, who has been through a lot with her own NDad, wasn't coping well at the beginning of this academic year, didn't tell anyone how bad things were getting for her and tried to kill herself. She damn near did too. Thank God for her flatmates finding her in time.

Naturally Elisabeth was extremely distressed by this and now that her friend has got the help she needs and is doing better it isn't something that she likes to talk about. Elisabeth is currently visiting the 'rents during her summer break from university. I'm two hundred miles away at home and she's telling me this via WhatsApp.

Yesterday Elisabeth had been out with that friend and NMom picked her up to take her back. During the car journey she decides it's the perfect time to speculate about why Elisabeth's friend tried to kill herself. Naturally my sister became increasingly upset by this. This annoyed NMom who told her that (paraphrasing) ""like it or not I'm your Mother, I can talk about whatever I want. I was really upset too because I'm friends with her mother and you are so rude for not wanting to talk about this with me.""

She then tries to guilt trip my sister. Saying that she doesn't understand people who won't talk about their feelings and that she talks about her feelings because she cares about people.

Elisabeth knows she's trying to guilt her and doesn't respond. NMom eventually tries to act like it didn't happen.

Then today she apologises for her behaviour and then demands an apology from Elisabeth. To which Elisabeth basically says ""for what? I didn't do anything"". NMom then throws a massive tantrum, goes to her room to bawl and still hasn't come out seven hours later.

Elisabeth is now feeling guilty. My blood is boiling. I am absolutely furious and I want to apparate there and slap NMom. Failing that, I want to call my NMom and scream at her for her behaviour. I know that's an all caps Bad Idea though.

1. I had UTIs very often as a child because she wouldn't let me go to the bathroom when I needed to.

I now have a life-long chronic illness called Interstitial Cystitis because she wouldn't let me go to the bathroom. 

2. I had hip dysplasia as a baby and she never put me in my brace. My hips now dislocate at random times, and it's very painful. 

3. I had OCD as a child and she used that to her advantage, triggering me on purpose with numerous counting games and forcing me to be anxious about pointless things because they were a trigger for me. I have minor OCD as an adult. 

4. She's abused me to the point of having CPTSD, and many other mental issues. I don't feel the need to elaborate on this one. 

5. I had a binge-eating disorder for a long time in my teen years that I could only trace back to my Nmom not feeding me for days as a child, limiting my water intake, etc. I would eat massive amounts of food when it was made clear to me that she didn't care anymore, and would end up getting sick from it all of the time.

My future is what I make of it, but when I start to wonder *why* I'm acting out in a certain way that doesn't make sense, I can generally trace it back to my living hell of a childhood that was caused solely by her, and the enablers around her.

Today's storytime in context to this question: 

I've only just learnt of why it's important to not let ourselves get sucked into these arguments with narcissists as we know you'll never ""win"" any arguments, discussions or disagreements with them. 

I'm currently practicing how to do this, but it's really hard. Today tested me. I was stuck in the car with her as she was driving me back from my hospital appointment. And I was telling her about my new health flare up (I had to tell her as it changes my diet and lifestyle significantly and she tends to buy the groceries most of the time during Covid times currently, though I buy the stuff I need for myself later if I see she doesn't).

In the ride back, she basically got all superior and busted out her ""everything you're saying is invalid and wrong, you're stupid and young, I'm right and all the reasons I'm saying for why your health flared up is 100% correct even though I'm not a doctor"" card on me.

I couldn't help but defend myself, but then I knew the mistake I made in my head once I did say my defence. Because it fueled her sadism, it fueled her by feeding off my emotional defensive reaction. 

Every time I defended myself, she just snapped back with ""URGH YOU ALWAYS LIKE TO ARGUE"". She sounds like a rude teenager. But that's the ONLY defence she has any time I say anything EVERY time she wants to start an argument with me. Of course, she gaslights the blame onto me even though she KNOWS what she's doing. 

I think if I do need to respond whenever she tries to start an argument with me, I just need to either not respond (even though I want to defend myself so bad or scream at her), or I'll just respond as emotionless and little as possible, like grey rocking. Because I know if I show even a LITTLE emotion in what I say, it just feeds her for some reason. I don't get why. It's the one thing I don't get about narcissists. Because emotions are interesting reactions to them? 

Anyway this 15-20 mins car ride back felt like a whole hour. 

I realised that I wasn't going to ""win"" once she started to keep screaming nagging nonsense and showing off her knowledge about the reasons why my health flared up and criticising every little thing I'm doing that's causing it just to try manipulate and gaslight me into believing what she's saying. 

It was then that I just stopped talking. I stopped talking because I knew there is literally nothing I can do or say that will convince her, a narcissist, to actually LISTEN and care about what I have to say for once. And this was whilst she was still screaming at me whilst driving (what a reckless driver).

I just rolled the window down and started to do subtle deep breaths to calm myself down and bring any sliver of peace I could within that car ride.

Add intermittent reinforcement and being fear mongered by my extremely manipulative and controlling narcissistic mom and dad I have some health issues that are easily fixable if only I could stop stressing out about them and take care of myself.

I have chronic gerd (heartburn) that comes from the stress of the abuse and self sabotage because what’s the point anyways? I can’t do anything right! (That has been drilled into my head for my whole life), and I also have fibromyalgia from being constantly in fight or flight.

As I have discovered the causes of these issues they are only getting worse as I have realized I need to cut off the only people I have talked to/complained to for many years. And got worse and worse and worse. More and more scared.

I’ve been severely scared of the future for years now and it is actually destroying me and my future. I talked to a psychiatrist yesterday and she prescribed me an antidepressant that will help with the ocd.

I definitely need something because I am destructing at a rapid rate. I can barely eat or sleep due to the stress of realizing what exactly has been going on. I’ve had flashbacks and ptsd and my nights if I do fall asleep are filled with the most painful nightmares.

This was within the last few years, so I'd be in my late 20's and had been living on my own and generally had a better frame of reference for things.  The one thing that struck me was that I essentially had to be ""rude"", by normal standards, in order to actually get anything through her head.  Of course then she'd huff about how I didn't have to be so rude to her all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

So the conversation, she was venting about some marital issues which honestly weren't really my business in the first place.  And it was going on just way too long, a couple hours, and I was getting stressed out to the point where I needed to stop a while ago and was having trouble not showing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey, this is really starting to get to me.

Her: Oh, I know, this is such a stressful situation &lt;keeps talking&gt;

Me: This is a bit much, can we take a break?

Her: Yeah it is a lot to deal with, isn't it?  &lt;keeps talking&gt;

Me: Ok, this is too much, I need a break.

Her: It's so hard to deal with all this stuff other people are doing.  Have you tried some relaxation techniques? &lt;keeps talking&gt;

Me: This is too much. I need you to stop following me around talking about this.

Her: Geez you don't have to be so rude about it!  I said we'd take a break whenever you needed, you could have just asked!

&amp;#x200B;

If I point out that I did ask, multiple times, she'll just say that I wasn't clear and I need to learn to be clearer rather than be rude.  But it can be hard for outside people to understand when they only see the last part.  In most normal relationships it would be rude to act like that.  But also in a normal, healthy relationship the other person would have backed off with the softer request.
